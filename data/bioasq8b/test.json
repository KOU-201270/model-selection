strategies after radiation exposure.", "We hypothesized that the gastrointestinal resident bacteria would demonstrate predictable, dose-dependent changes after radiation exposure across two large animal models of acute radiation syndrome.", "Here, G\u00f6ttingen minipigs (GMP) (n = 50) and rhesus macaques (n = 48) were exposed to five dose levels (resulting in mortality rates of 33-100% and 25-68.7%, respectively).", "Fecal samples taken prior to and after irradiation (day 0 for GMP; day 0, 3 and 14 for macaques) were used for 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high-throughput sequencing.", "Baseline gut microbiota profiles were dissimilar between GMP and macaques, however, radiation appeared to have similar effect at the phylum level, resulting in Bacteroidetes decrease and Firmicutes increase in both models.", "The abundance of the main Bacteroidetes genus ( Bacteroides for GMP, Prevotella for macaques) was profoundly decreased by irradiation.", "Intracellular symbionts [Elusimicrobia in GMP, Treponema (Spirochaetes) in macaques] consistently increased after irradiation, suggesting their use as potential biomarkers of intestinal injury, and potential negative effect on health.", "Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium XIVa, Oscillibacter and Elusimicrobium/ Treponema abundances were found to be very significantly correlated with radiation intensity.", "Furthermore, Prevotella, Enterorhabdus and Ruminococcus and Enterorhabdus maintenance was strongly associated with survival in GMP, while Prevotella, Oscillibacter and Treponema were strongly associated with survival and Streptococcus with death in macaques.", "Overall, we found that a wide range of gut bacterial genera known to be abundant in the human gut microbiota are excellent biomarkers of radiation intensity and resilience in animal models, and that detrimental effects can be monitored, and potentially prevented, by targeting selected genera.", "In rodent studies, the gut microbiota has been implicated in facilitating both radioresistance, by protecting the epithelium from apoptotic responses and radiosensitivity, inducing endothelial apoptotic responses.", "Despite the observation that large animal models, such as the Chinese Rhesus macaque and the Gottingen Minipig, demonstrate similarity to human physiologic responses to radiation, little is known about radiation-induced changes of the gut microbiome in these models.", "To compare the two models, we used bioequivalent radiation doses which resulted in an LD50 for Gottingen Minipigs and Chinese Rhesus macaques, 1.9 Gy and 6.8 Gy, respectively.", "Fecal samples taken prior and 3 days post-radiation were used for 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq).", "Baseline gut microbiota profiles were dissimilar between minipigs and rhesus macaques.", "Significant increases of intracellular symbionts were common to both models and to reported changes in rodents suggesting universality of these findings post-radiation.", "Remarkably, opposite dynamics were observed for the main phyla, with increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in minipigs but with enrichment of Bacteroidetes in rhesus macaques.", "Minipig changes in magnitude and in variety of species affected were more extensive than those observed in rhesus macaques.", "This pilot study provides an important first step in comparing the radiosensitive pig model to the comparatively more radioresistant macaque model, for the identification of microbial elements which may influence radiosensitivity.", "The sterile insect technique (SIT) as an eco-friendly and reliable strategy has been used to control populations of insect pests of agricultural, veterinary and human health importance.", "Successful applications of SIT rely on the high-level ecological fitness of sterile males.", "A suitable and stable gut microbiome can contribute to the ecological fitness of insect by influencing their physiology, biochemistry and development processes.", "Here, we show that a shift in the gut bacterial composition and structure by sterilizing irradiation, characterized by a decrease in the major gut microbiota community Enterobacteriaceae, an expansion of the minor members (e.g., Bacillaceae) and a higher richness and diversity, is tightly linked to radiation-induced ecological fitness (male mating competitiveness, flight capacity, survival rate and life span) decline in <i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i> (Hendel) sterile males.", "Function prediction of gut microbiota indicated that changes in microbiome taxonomy tend to drive microbiome functional shifts.", "A higher nutrient consumption of the flourishing minor gut microbiota may cause a decline in nutrients and energy metabolic activity of host and then result in the reduced ecological fitness of irradiated flies.", "Furthermore, we found that a gut bacterial strain <i>Klebsiella oxytoca</i> (BD177) can restore ecological fitness by improving food intake and increasing haemolymph sugar and amino acid levels of irradiated <i>B. dorsalis</i> flies.", "Implementing

efficiency (above 95%) and specificity when employed to separate multiple EpCAM-positive tumor cells, due to the abundant carboxyl groups in the structure of PIL, which enhanced the coupling efficiency of MNs with anti-EpCAM by chemical bonding between carboxyls and amines, thereby enabling more target cells adhered onto IMNs.", "Under the optimized capture conditions, IMNs were shown an excellent cell capture performance in the range of 5-400 cells/mL in three different cases (e.g., PBS, MCF-7 and THP-1 mixed cell suspension, lysed blood).", "More significantly, our results indicated that with modification of PIL, in addition to the capture efficiency, the cell viability rate of CTCs was also greatly improved (98%) owing to the nontoxic and biocompatible properties of PIL, which realized the proliferation of the rare number CTCs for further molecular characterization.", "Based on the metabolic features of cancer cells, live CTCs can be quantified indirectly through their

sequences of MVA are 97 to 99% identical to those of other vaccinia virus strains, extensive binding cross-reactivity is expected, except for those deleted or truncated.", "Despite different hosts and

infectious diseases, its immunogenicity is likely limited due to the inability of the virus to replicate productively in mammalian hosts.", "In light of recent data demonstrating that vaccinia viruses, including MVA, preferentially infect antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play crucial roles in generating antiviral immunity, we hypothesized that expression of specific cytokines and chemokines that mediate APC recruitment and activation from recombinant MVA (rMVA) vectors would enhance the immunogenicity of these vectors.", "To test this hypothesis, we generated rMVAs that

(hFlt3-L), factors predicted to increase levels of dendritic cells (DCs), to recruit DCs to sites of immunization, or to promote maturation of DCs in vivo, respectively.", "These rMVAs also coexpress the well-characterized, immunodominant lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (NP) antigen that enabled sensitive and quantitative assessment of antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses following immunization of BALB/c mice.", "Our results demonstrate that immunization of mice with rMVAs expressing mGM-CSF or hCCL20, but not hFlt3-L, results in two- to fourfold increases of cellular immune responses directed against vector-encoded antigens and 6- to 17-fold enhancements of MVA-specific antibody titers, compared to those responses elicited by nonadjuvanted rMVA.", "Of note, cytokine augmentation of cellular immune responses occurs when rMVAs are given as primary immunizations but not when they are used as booster immunizations, suggesting that these APC-modulating proteins, when used as poxvirus-encoded adjuvants, are more effective at stimulating na\u00efve T-cell responses than in promoting recall of preexisting memory T-cell responses.", "Our results

The SPT4, SPT5, and SPT6 gene products define a class of transcriptional repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are thought to function through their effects on chromatin assembly or stability. The SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified originally by mutations that suppress delta insertion mutations at HIS4 and LYS2.  Taken together, these genetic and biochemical results indicate that SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6 function together in a transcriptional process that is essential for viability in yeast.

assembly of H3-H4 dimers onto newly synthesized DNA.", "In most mammalian cell lines, chromatin located at the nuclear periphery is represented by condensed heterochromatin, as evidenced by microscopy observations and DamID mapping of lamina-associated domains (LADs) enriched in dimethylated Lys9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2).", "However, in Kc167 cell culture, the only Drosophilla cell type where LADs

origin, in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in glia and the fat body, HP1a domains appear to overlap strongly with LADs in both the chromosome arms and pericentromeric regions.", "Accordingly, centromeres reside closer to the nuclear lamina in neurons than in Kc167 cells.", "These domains are occupied by silent or weakly expressed genes with genes residing in the HP1a-bound LADs expressed at the lowest level.", "In various differentiated Drosophila cell types, we discovered the existence of peripheral heterochromatin, similar to that observed in mammals.", "Our findings support the model that peripheral heterochromatin matures enhancing the repression of unwanted genes as cells terminally differentiate.", "While it is known that micronuclei pose a serious risk to genomic integrity by undergoing chromothripsis, mechanisms preventing micronucleus formation remain poorly understood.", "Here, we investigate how late-segregating acentric chromosomes that would otherwise form micronuclei instead reintegrate into daughter nuclei by passing through Aurora B kinase-dependent channels in the nuclear envelope of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> neuroblasts.", "We find that localized concentrations of Aurora B preferentially phosphorylate H3(S10) on acentrics and their associated DNA tethers.", "This phosphorylation event prevents HP1a from associating with heterochromatin and results in localized inhibition of nuclear envelope reassembly on endonuclease- and X-irradiation-induced acentrics, promoting channel formation.", "Taken together, these results

mechanisms include (a) NHEJ, a DSB repair process that does not require any homology and which functions in all stages of the cell cycle (and is of particular relevance in G0/G1); (b) MMEJ, also a DSB repair process but which requires microhomology and which presumably functions in all cell cycle stages; (c) NAHR, a recombination-based DSB repair mechanism which operates in prophase I of meiosis in germ cells; (d) MMBIR, a microhomology-mediated, replication-based mechanism which operates in the S phase of the cell cycle, and (e) strand slippage during replication (involved in the origin of small insertions and deletions (INDELs).", "Our analysis permits the inference that, between them, these five mechanisms can explain nearly all naturally occurring deletions of different sizes

of the operation of NHEJ/MMEJ processes, as currently formulated, are expected to be relatively small.", "However, data on induced mutations in mouse spermatogonial stem cells (irradiation in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and DSB repair presumed to be via NHEJ predominantly) show that most are associated with deletions of different sizes, some in the megabase range.", "There is thus a

level.", "We have used a shuttle vector, pHAZE, to analyze the mechanism of rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks in human cells.", "The advantage of this vector system is that, unlike many previously
