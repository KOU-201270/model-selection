Autoimmunity directed against pancreatic islet cells results in slowly progressive selective beta-cell destruction (\"Primary autoimmune insulitis\"), culminating over years in clinically manifested insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Circulating serum autoantibodies directed against the endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans (Islet cell autoantibodies - ICAb) are an important hallmark of this disease. Assays for islet cell autoantibodies have facilitated the investigation and understanding of several facets in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Their applications have extended into clinical practice and have opened new avenues for early preclinical prediction and preventive prophylaxis in IDDM/type 1 DM. Recently, surprisingly, differences in insulin content between T1DM islets, as well as, 'patchy' or 'lobular' destruction of islets have been described. These unique pathobiological phenomena, suggest that beta cell destruction may not always be inexorable and inevitably complete/total, and thus raise hopes for possible therapeutic interruption of beta cell autoimmunity - destruction and cure of type 1 diabetes. \"Recurrent or secondary autoimmune insulitis\" refers to the rapid reappearance of islet cell autoantibodies post pancreas transplant, and selective islet beta cell destruction in the grafted pancreas [never forgetting or \"anamnestic\" beta cell destructive memory], in the absence of any graft pancreas rejection [monozygotic twin to twin transplantation]. The one definite environmental factor is congenital rubella, because of which a subset of children subsequently develop type 1 diabetes. The putative predisposing factors are viruses, gluten and cow's milk. The putative protective factors include gut flora, helminths, viral infections, and Vitamin D. Prevention of T1DM can include: Primary prevention strategies before the development of autoantibodies and Secondary prevention regimens after autoantibody development. Once islet cell autoantibodies have developed, the goal is to establish a therapeutic regimen to preserve at least 90% of the beta cells, and prevent the development of hyperglycaemia. The targets for T1DM reversal should include autoimmunity, beta cell regeneration and protection of beta cell mass. Anti-CD3 teplizumab and anti-CD3 otelixizumab have been shown to provide C-peptide preservation. The unanswered questions in diabetes research include elimination of autoimmune memory responses, reestablishment of immune self-tolerance, and mechanisms of disease initiation.",

This article reviews prevention studies undertaken either prior to any evidence of autoimmunity (primary prevention) or after the development of islet autoantibodies (secondary prevention). Most immune intervention studies have been conducted in recent-onset type 1 diabetes (tertiary prevention), and these are not reviewed herein. The goal of primary and secondary intervention is to arrest the immune process and thus prevent or delay clinical disease. Primary prevention studies have been conducted in infants with high genetic risk. Interventions tested include several dietary manipulations, including infant formulas free of either cow's milk or of bovine insulin, infant formula supplemented with the omega-3-fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid, delayed introduction of gluten-containing foods, and vitamin D supplementation. Secondary prevention studies have been conducted in both children and adults with diabetes autoantibodies.

In this phase 3 trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy of one such antibody, teplizumab. In this 2-year trial, patients aged 8-35 years who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for 12 weeks or fewer were enrolled and treated at 83 clinical centres in North America, Europe, Israel, and India. Participants were allocated (2:1:1:1 ratio) by an interactive telephone system, according to computer-generated block randomisation, to receive one of three regimens of teplizumab infusions (14-day full dose, 14-day low dose, or 6-day full dose) or placebo at baseline and at 26 weeks. The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 study is still underway, and patients and study staff remain masked through to study closure. The primary composite outcome was the percentage of patients with insulin use of less than 0\u00b75 U/kg per day and glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1C)) of less than 6\u00b75% at 1 year.

This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00385697\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT00385697</a>. 763 patients were screened, of whom 516 were randomised to receive 14-day full-dose teplizumab (n=209), 14-day low-dose teplizumab (n=102), 6-day full-dose teplizumab (n=106), or placebo (n=99). Two patients in the 14-day full-dose group and one patient in the placebo group did not start treatment, so 513 patients were eligible for efficacy analyses. The primary outcome did not differ between groups at 1 year: 19\u00b78% (41/207) in the 14-day full-dose group; 13\u00b77% (14/102) in the 14-day low-dose group; 20\u00b78% (22/106) in the 6-day full-dose group; and 20\u00b74% (20/98) in the placebo group. 5% (19/415) of patients in the teplizumab groups were not taking insulin at 1 year, compared with no patients in the placebo group at 1 year (p=0\u00b703). Across the four study groups, similar proportions of patients had adverse events (414/417 [99%] in the teplizumab groups vs 98/99 [99%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (42/417 [10%] vs 9/99 [9%]). The most common clinical adverse event in the teplizumab groups was rash (220/417 [53%] vs 20/99 [20%] in the placebo group). Findings of exploratory analyses suggest that future studies of immunotherapeutic intervention with teplizumab might have increased success in prevention of a decline in \u03b2-cell function (measured by C-peptide) and provision of glycaemic control at reduced doses of insulin if they target patients early after diagnosis of diabetes and children.

Immunological interventions are directed at arresting the loss of beta-cell function with the promise that this will make it easier for patients to control their glucose levels. This review provides a summary of the preclinical and clinical research published between 1992 and 2009 using teplizumab and other anti-CD3 antibodies to arrest the loss of beta-cell function in new onset T1D. Data from animal and human studies on the probable mechanism of action of teplizumab are also reviewed. A broad perspective on the use of teplizumab in inducing disease specific tolerance. In Phase I/II randomized control trials, in patients with new onset T1D, teplizumab slowed the rate of loss of beta-cell function over 2 years of follow-up. Treated patients had better glycemic control and lower insulin requirements. Adverse events so far are mild and of limited duration.

Searches were limited to articles published in English. Clinical trials evaluating teplizumab for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) published in English were selected from the data sources. All published relevant abstracts were included. References cited in identified articles were used for additional citations. T1DM accounts for up to 10% of all cases of diabetes mellitus. T1DM is characterized as a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease leading to the destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells of the pancreas. Teplizumab is a humanized Fc-mutated anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody that alters the function of the T-lymphocytes that mediate the destruction of the insulin-producing \u03b2-cells. While clinical data are limited, both Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies have demonstrated preserved C-peptide response as a measure of insulin production, decreased exogenous insulin use, and improved glycemic control following a 12- to 14-day teplizumab infusion in patients diagnosed with T1DM within the previous 6 weeks. However, 1 Phase 3 trial failed to find the same benefits in those diagnosed with T1DM within the previous 12 weeks when a lower cumulative teplizumab dose was used. Initial studies indicated that teplizumab is well tolerated, with a self-limiting rash as the most commonly reported adverse effect. Teplizumab is an anti-CD3 human monoclonal antibody with promising activity in treatment of patients with T1DM. Results from Phase 3 trials are needed to further determine safety, efficacy, and dosing frequency.",

Beginning with studies of cyclosporin A in the 1980s, but with more activity in the past decade, there have been a number of clinical trials to test whether immunotherapies can arrest the decline in C-peptide, which is associated with progression of type 1 diabetes leading to the metabolic instability that characterizes the disease. One of the most promising agents, teplizumab , is an FcR-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody that has been tested in Phase II - III clinical trials and was shown to preserve the C-peptide levels and reduce the need for exogenous insulin. In this review, we discuss the recent update on clinical data obtained from trials of teplizumab in type 1 diabetes, the drug's postulated mechanism of action and the identification of responders to therapy. We highlight the results of recent trials as well as the lessons that have been learned from the clinical trials involving selection of end points and the inclusion of diverse study populations. Teplizumab has been shown to preserve \u03b2 cell function in patients; however, it does not represent a 'cure' for patients, and its efficacy does entail a significant advance in arresting the progression of the disease toward complete insulin deficiency and reliance on exogenous insulin.",

Despite the improved management of type 1 diabetes with exogenous insulin, most patients do not meet clinical glycaemic goals, and diabetes remains an important medical problem that affects children and adults. Clinical and preclinical studies have suggested strategies to prevent the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in people at risk, but the outcomes of previous clinical trials have not met their primary endpoints of disease prevention or delay. The results from the TN-10 teplizumab prevention trial show that the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes can be delayed by treatment with a FcR non-binding monoclonal antibody to CD3 in people at high risk for disease. This Series paper discusses how this clinical achievement raises new questions about for whom, and when, immunological strategies might be developed to prevent type 1 diabetes, and how to achieve this goal.",

Our aim was to determine whether two courses of teplizumab, an Fc receptor-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, reduces the decline in C-peptide levels in patients with T1D 2 years after disease onset. We also set out to identify characteristics of responders. We treated 52 subjects with new-onset T1D with teplizumab for 2 weeks at diagnosis and after 1 year in an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. In the intent to treat analysis of the primary end point, patients treated with teplizumab had a reduced decline in C-peptide at 2 years (mean -0.28 nmol/L [95% CI -0.36 to -0.20]) versus control (mean -0.46 nmol/L [95% CI -0.57 to -0.35]; P = 0.002), a 75% improvement. The most common adverse events were rash, transient upper respiratory infections, headache, and nausea. In a post hoc analysis we characterized clinical responders and found that metabolic (HbA1c and insulin use) and immunologic features distinguished this group from those who did not respond to teplizumab. We conclude that teplizumab treatment preserves insulin production and reduces the use of exogenous insulin in some patients with new-onset T1D. Metabolic and immunologic features at baseline can identify a subgroup with robust responses to immune therapy.",

We tested whether treatment with teplizumab (a Fc receptor non-binding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody), after the new-onset period, affects the decline in C-peptide production in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In a randomised placebo-controlled trial we treated 58 participants with type 1 diabetes for 4-12 months with teplizumab or placebo at four academic centres in the USA. A central randomisation centre used computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Investigators, patients, and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was a comparison of C-peptide responses to a mixed meal after 1 year. We explored modification of treatment effects in subgroups of patients. Thirty-four and 29 subjects were randomized to the drug and placebo treated groups, respectively. Thirty-one and 27, respectively, were analysed. Although the primary outcome analysis showed a 21.7% higher C-peptide response in the teplizumab-treated group (0.45 vs 0.371; difference, 0.059 [95% CI 0.006, 0.115] nmol/l) (p = 0.03), when corrected for baseline imbalances in HbA(1c) levels, the C-peptide levels in the teplizumab-treated group were 17.7% higher (0.44 vs 0.378; difference, 0.049 [95% CI 0, 0.108] nmol/l, p = 0.09). A greater proportion of placebo-treated participants lost detectable C-peptide responses at 12 months (p = 0.03). The teplizumab group required less exogenous insulin (p &lt; 0.001) but treatment differences in HbA(1c) levels were not observed. Teplizumab was well tolerated. A subgroup analysis showed that treatment benefits were larger in younger individuals and those with HbA(1c) &lt;6.5% at entry. Clinical responders to teplizumab had an increase in circulating CD8 central memory cells 2 months after enrolment compared with non-responders. This study suggests that deterioration in insulin secretion may be affected by immune therapy with teplizumab after the new-onset period but the magnitude of the effect is less than during the new-onset period.

Ever since the discovery of insulin almost 100 years ago, patients with T1D have relied on multiple daily insulin injections to survive an otherwise deadly disease. Despite decades of research and clinical trials, no treatment exists yet to prevent or cure T1D. A recent prevention trial using the anti-CD3 antibody teplizumab in individuals at a high risk of developing T1D has provided the first piece of evidence that a safe and transient intervention may be able to delay disease. In this Perspective, we review the 40-year long history of anti-CD3 and discuss how this antibody became a candidate for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes. The path that leads to its use in this latest clinical trial for T1D has been winding and strewn with setbacks. The molecular actions of the anti-CD3 antibody that target T lymphocytes are well-understood, but its systemic effect on immune function has proven more difficult to unravel. Moreover, preclinical data suggested that the utility of anti-CD3 for the prevention of T1D may be limited. However, the latest clinical data are encouraging and exemplify how a basic discovery can, decades later and with much perseverance, become a promising therapeutic candidate.",

Clinical drug-treated responders showed an increased frequency of 'partially exhausted' CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We studied the clinical, immunological and metabolic status of participants after an average follow-up of 7 years. Participants with detectable C-peptide at year 2 of AbATE returned for follow-up. C-peptide responses were assessed by 4 h mixed-meal tolerance test. Autoantibodies and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were measured and average daily insulin use was obtained from patient logs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed by flow cytometry and cytokine release. Fifty-six per cent of the original participants returned. Three of the original control group who did not return had lost all detectable C-peptide by the end of the 2 year trial. The C-peptide responses to a mixed-meal tolerance test were similar overall in the drug vs control group of participants but were significantly improved, with less loss of C-peptide, in drug-treated responders identified at 1 year. However, the improvements in C-peptide response were not associated with lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels or insulin use. Drug-treated responders showed a significantly increased frequency of programmed cell death protein 1-positive central memory and anergic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at follow-up.

Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B). NPD A is associated with a uniformly devastating disease course, with rapidly progressing psychomotor degeneration, leading to death typically by the age of 3 years, most often from respiratory failure. In contrast, the clinical phenotype and life expectancy of patients with NPD B may vary widely. Almost all patients have hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic lipid profile, and most patients have interstitial lung disease with progressive impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities including cytopenias. Other common clinical manifestations include liver dysfunction, heart disease, skeletal abnormalities and growth delays. Some patients with ASMD who survive beyond early childhood have intermediate phenotypes (variant NPD B) characterized by combinations of non-neurologic and mild to severe neurologic symptoms. The physical and psychosocial burden of illness in patients with NPD B is substantial. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, joint or limb pain, abdominal pain, bleeding and bruising. The disease often leads to chronic fatigue, limited physical or social activity and difficulties in performing daily activities or work. Many patients die before or in early adulthood, often from pneumonia/respiratory failure or liver failure. Available treatments are limited to symptom management and supportive care. An enzyme replacement therapy currently in clinical development is expected to be the first treatment addressing the underlying pathology of the disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential for reducing the risk of complications.

Liver-related issues, including cirrhosis and variceal haemorrhage, are a leading cause of early mortality in individuals with chronic forms of ASMD. Due to the rarity of this lysosomal storage disorder, there can be a lack of awareness that adults with chronic ASMD disease are at significant risk of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and variceal bleeding. This case highlights an unusual presentation of recurrent variceal bleeding in an adult with cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to chronic visceral ASMD. A patient with severe splenomegaly was diagnosed with ASMD at age of 25. At age 64 they had multiple hospital admissions for hematochezia (originally diagnosed as ischemic colitis) accompanied by hypotension (blood pressure 91/45 mmHg), anemia (hemoglobin 8.5g/dL, ref 12-16; INR 1.4, ref \u22641.2), and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.33mg/dL, ref 0.51-0.95). Colonoscopy did not reveal a source of bleeding. Computerized tomography scanning imaging showed diffuse venous collaterals and ascites. Arteriographies during subsequent episodes of bleeding were negative for active arterial intestinal bleeding. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was found to originate from a varicose vein cluster connected to the right iliac vein and the superior mesenteric vein, located in the submucosa of a small intestinal loop. Multiple varices were secondary to portal hypertension in the context of cirrhosis. The patient died from recurrent variceal bleeding that exacerbated liver failure worsened by pneumonia and hypovolemic and septic shock. The variceal bleeding in this patient was atypical in that it originated from venous collaterals bleeding into the small intestine rather than the more typical gastroesophageal varices observed in ASMD. With long standing liver dysfunction and gradual development of portal hypertension, intestinal varices rather than occult intestinal bleeding due to ischemia should be considered in ASMD patients presenting with either hematochezia or hematemesis.",

Their biological roles are only partly understood, although it is assumed that they modulate the activity of HS-binding growth factors. The involvement of glypicans in developmental morphogenesis and growth regulation has been highlighted by Drosophila mutants and by a human overgrowth syndrome with multiple malformations caused by glypican 3 mutations (Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome). We now report that autosomal-recessive omodysplasia, a genetic condition characterized by short-limbed short stature, craniofacial dysmorphism, and variable developmental delay, maps to chromosome 13 (13q31.1-q32.2) and is caused by point mutations or by larger genomic rearrangements in glypican 6 (GPC6). All mutations cause truncation of the GPC6 protein and abolish both the HS-binding site and the GPI-bearing membrane-associated domain, and thus loss of function is predicted. Expression studies in microdissected mouse growth plate revealed expression of Gpc6 in proliferative chondrocytes. Thus, GPC6 seems to have a previously unsuspected role in endochondral ossification and skeletal growth, and its functional abrogation results in a short-limb phenotype.",

Here, patients with Parkinson's disease from the open-label trial were followed up in the long term to assess the safety and efficacy of ProSavin after bilateral injection into the putamen. Fifteen patients who were previously treated with ProSavin have been followed for up to 5 years, with some having been seen for 8 years.

As a result, exposure to relatively high doses of x-rays from diagnostic examinations and therapeutic treatment was common. In the present article the authors review the literature relating to radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs). Emphasis is placed on meningiomas resulting from childhood treatment for primary brain tumor or tinea capitis, exposure to dental x-rays, and exposure to atomic explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The incidence and natural history of RIMs following exposure to high- and low-dose radiation is presented, including latency, multiplicity, histopathological features, and recurrence rates. The authors review the typical presentation of patients with RIMs and discuss unique aspects of the surgical management of these tumors compared with sporadic meningioma, based on their clinical experience in treating these lesions.",

Our aims were to assess the risk of radiation-induced malignant brain tumors and benign meningiomas after childhood exposure and to investigate the role of potential modifiers of that risk. The study population included 10,834 individuals who were treated for tinea capitis with X rays in the 1950s and two matched nonirradiated groups, comprising population and sibling comparison groups. The mean estimated radiation dose to the brain was 1.5 Gy. Survival analysis using Poisson regression was performed to estimate the excess relative and absolute risks (ERR, EAR) for brain tumors. After a median follow-up of 40 years, an ERR/Gy of 4.63 and 1.98 (95% CI = 2.43-9.12 and 0.73-4.69) and an EAR/Gy per 10(4) PY of 0.48 and 0.31 (95% CI = 0.28-0.73 and 0.12-0.53) were observed for benign meningiomas and malignant brain tumors, respectively. The risk of both types of tumors was positively associated with dose. The estimated ERR/Gy for malignant brain tumors decreased with increasing age at irradiation from 3.56 to 0.47 (P = 0.037), while no trend with age was seen for benign meningiomas.

The authors describe a series of 10 patients with meningiomas and a previous history of high-dose radiation therapy, usually given for a primary brain tumor. Of the 10 patients, eight were female, three had multiple meningiomas, and the majority had other stigmata of previous radiation therapy. Eight meningiomas were examined pathologically and one-half were classified as either aggressive or atypical, or were noted to have a high bromodeoxyuridine labeling index. The average time from radiation therapy to diagnosis of a meningioma was 24 years (range 5 to 40 years), a shorter interval than that previously reported for meningiomas induced by lower doses of irradiation. Within this series, patient age at irradiation was significantly correlated with tumor latency; individuals who were younger at the time of radiation therapy had a shorter time to meningioma formation. The latency of meningioma formation is therefore influenced by both the radiation dose and the age of the patient at irradiation.",

Examination of those rats that died in the two-year interval after irradiation of the head revealed a linear dose-response for total head and neck tumor incidence in the dose range of 0-8.5 Gy. The exposed rats had a greater incidence of pituitary chromophobe adenomas, epithelial and mesothelial cell tumors than the unexposed controls but the excessive occurrence of malignant gliomas that was observed in the monkeys was absent in the rats.

There were no differences in other surgical conditions between the irradiated and nonirradiated groups. Persons irradiated under age 6 years had the highest excess risk for developing carcinomas. The incidence of thyroid neoplasms was approximately threefold higher in women than in men among the irradiated persons and among the controls, but the relative risk for the irradiated group of women was greater than the addition of the relative risks of the other groups.

There is evidence to show that moderate doses of ionising radiations given in childhood for tinea capitis are associated with a late risk of developing a meningioma. Higher doses of radiation used for tumours in childhood are followed also by a late hazard of meningioma. There is insufficient evidence to implicate ionising radiations in the aetiology of gliomas.

The main data come from series of patients who underwent radiotherapy during childhood: a high incidence of tumors of the nervous system is found after irradiation of one to a few grays as treatment of a benign disease (especially tinea capitis), as well as after irradiation at higher doses of a few tens of grays for the treatment of cancer (in particular cerebral irradiation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia). The type of radiation-induced tumors is variable, but meningioma is more frequent after low doses and glioma and sarcoma after higher doses used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. A dose-effect relationship appeared between the risk of tumor of the nervous system and the radiation dose. The risk was higher when radiation was delivered at a younger age. Much less data are available after radiotherapy in the adulthood, but an increased risk of cerebral tumor appears in the series of ankylosing spondylitis patients. As for the exposures to radiodiagnosis exams, the main problem is the risk of cerebral tumor in children whose mother has undergone abdominal or pelvic X-rays during pregnancy. No risk of neurologic tumor was found in the A-bomb survivors irradiated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Occupational exposure to ionising radiation has been incriminated in the first radiologists exposed to high doses. In nuclear industry workers, the results of epidemiological studies are contradictory and at the present time it is not possible to link their radiologic exposure with a risk of tumor of the nervous system. In populations living near nuclear plants, mortality due to tumors of the nervous system was not increased.",

In Western populations HD has a prevalence of 10.6-13.7 individuals per 100 000. It is characterized by cognitive, motor and psychiatric disturbance. At the cellular level mutant huntingtin results in neuronal dysfunction and death through a number of mechanisms, including disruption of proteostasis, transcription and mitochondrial function and direct toxicity of the mutant protein. Early macroscopic changes are seen in the striatum with involvement of the cortex as the disease progresses. There are currently no disease modifying treatments; therefore supportive and symptomatic management is the mainstay of treatment. In recent years there have been significant advances in understanding both the cellular pathology and the macroscopic structural brain changes that occur as the disease progresses. In the last decade there has been a large growth in potential therapeutic targets and clinical trials. Perhaps the most promising of these are the emerging therapies aimed at lowering levels of mutant huntingtin. Antisense oligonucleotide therapy is one such approach with clinical trials currently under way. This may bring us one step closer to treating and potentially preventing this devastating condition.",

PolyQ expansion promotes misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT (mHTT) within neurons. The cellular pathways, including ubiquitin-dependent processes, by which mHTT is regulated remain incompletely understood. Ube2W is the only ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) known to ubiquitinate substrates at their amino (N)-termini, likely favoring substrates with disordered N-termini. By virtue of its N-terminal polyQ domain, HTT has an intrinsically disordered amino terminus. In studies employing immortalized cells, primary neurons and a knock-in (KI) mouse model of HD, we tested the effect of Ube2W deficiency on mHTT levels, aggregation and neurotoxicity. In cultured cells, deficiency of Ube2W activity markedly decreases mHTT aggregate formation and increases the level of soluble monomers, while reducing mHTT-induced cytotoxicity. Consistent with this result, the absence of Ube2W in HdhQ200 KI mice significantly increases levels of soluble monomeric mHTT while reducing insoluble oligomeric species.

The transcribed mutant RNA contains expanded CAG repeats that translate into a mutant huntingtin protein. This expanded CAG repeat also causes mis-splicing of pre-mRNA due to sequestration of muscle blind like-1 splicing factor (MBNL1), and thus both of these elicit the pathogenesis of HD. Targeting the onset as well as progression of HD by small molecules could be a potent therapeutic approach. We have screened a set of small molecules to target this transcript and found Myricetin, a flavonoid, as a lead molecule that interacts with the CAG motif and thus prevents the translation of mutant huntingtin protein as well as sequestration of MBNL1. Here, we report the first solution structure of the complex formed between Myricetin and RNA containing the 5'CAG/3'GAC motif. Myricetin interacts with this RNA via base stacking at the AA mismatch. Moreover, Myricetin was also found reducing the proteo-toxicity generated due to the aggregation of polyglutamine, and further, its supplementation also improves neurobehavioral deficits in the HD mouse model. Our study provides the structural and mechanistic basis of Myricetin as an effective therapeutic candidate for HD and other polyQ related disorders.",

We recently used immortalized HEK-293 cells expressing the 1st exon of the mutant HTT gene as a cellular model of HD, and showed that the stimulation of autophagy by genistein corrected the mutant phenotype. However, effects of genistein on HD patient-derived cells remained unknown. In this report, we demonstrated that genistein also instigated degradation of mHTT in fibroblasts derived from HD patients. This was assessed as a significant decrease in the levels of HTT in HD fibroblasts measured by Western-blotting, and the disappearance of intracellular mHTT aggregates in cells observed by fluorescent microscopy. Fibroblasts derived from control persons were not affected by genistein treatment. These results indicate that genistein can improve HD phenotype in patient-derived cells, and substantiates the need for further studies of this isoflavone as a potential therapeutic agent.",

To date, the disease pathophysiology has been thought to be primarily driven by cell-autonomous mechanisms, but, here, we demonstrate that fibroblasts derived from HD patients carrying either 72, 143 and 180 CAG repeats as well as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) also characterized by 143 CAG repeats can transmit protein aggregates to genetically unrelated and healthy host tissue following implantation into the cerebral ventricles of neonatal mice in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. Transmitted mHtt aggregates gave rise to both motor and cognitive impairments, loss of striatal medium spiny neurons, increased inflammation and gliosis in associated brain regions, thereby recapitulating the behavioural and pathological phenotypes which characterizes HD. In addition, both in vitro work using co-cultures of mouse neural stem cells with 143 CAG fibroblasts and the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line as well as in vivo experiments conducted in newborn wild-type mice suggest that exosomes can cargo mHtt between cells triggering the manifestation of HD-related behaviour and pathology. This is the first evidence of human-to-mouse prion-like propagation of mHtt in the mammalian brain; a finding which will help unravel the molecular bases of HD pathology as well as to lead to the development of a whole new range of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS.",

Compared with controls, we found brain levels of NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), elevated in human HD postmortem cortex and striatum and highest in striatum of presymptomatic individuals. Synaptosome fractions from cortex and striatum of HD(140Q/140Q) mice had elevated NOX activity at 3 months of age and a further rise at 6 and 12 months compared with synaptosomes of age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. High NOX activity in primary cortical and striatal neurons of HD(140Q/140Q) mice correlated with more ROS and neurite swellings. These features and neuronal cell death were markedly reduced by treatment with NOX inhibitors such as diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), apocynin (APO) and VAS2870. The rise in ROS levels in mitochondria of HD(140Q/140Q) neurons followed the rise in NOX activity and inhibiting only mitochondrial ROS was not neuroprotective. Mutant Htt colocalized at plasma membrane lipid rafts with gp91-phox, a catalytic subunit for the NOX2 isoform. Assembly of NOX2 components at lipid rafts requires activation of Rac1 which was also elevated in HD(140Q/140Q) neurons. HD(140Q/140Q) mice bred to gp91-phox knock-out mice had lower NOX activity in the brain and in primary neurons, and neurons had normal ROS levels and significantly improved survival.

Mechanisms of cell death are unclear, but processes involving mitochondrial abnormalities, excitotoxicity, and abnormal protein degradation have been implicated. Many factors likely contribute to neuron death and dysfunction, and this has made it difficult to systematically address the pathology in HD. Pharmaceutical therapies are commonly used in patients to treat disease symptoms. These have limited benefit and do not address the inexorable disease progression. Several neuroprotective therapies are being evaluated in animal models of HD as well as in clinical trials. Similarly, cell replacement strategies such as fetal transplantation have been used in the clinic with minimal success, making future cell replacement strategies such as stem cell therapy uncertain.

Pathophysiology of disease involves several tissues; indeed it has been shown that there is a broad toxic effect of mHTT in the peripheral tissue of patients with HD, not only in the central nervous system. In this study we compared gene expression profiles (GEP) of HD fibroblasts and matched controls using microarray technology. We used RT-PCR to test the consistency of the microarray data and we found four genes up-regulated in HD patients with respect to control individuals. The genes appear to be involved in different pathways that have been shown to be perturbed even in HD models and patients. Although our study is preliminary and has to be extended to a larger cohort of HD patients and controls, nevertheless it shows that gene expression profiles seem to be altered in the fibroblasts of HD patients.

To study whether mutated huntingtin has the same neuronal distribution and intracellular location as normal huntingtin, we analyzed immunohistochemically both forms of this protein in the brain of 5 controls and 5 patients with Huntington's disease. We show that the distribution of mutated huntingtin is, like that of the normal form, heterogeneous throughout the brain, but is not limited to vulnerable neurons in Huntington's disease, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the mutated huntingtin in a neuron is not in itself sufficient to lead to neuronal death. Moreover, whereas normal huntingtin is detected in some neuronal perikarya, nerve fibers, and nerve endings, the mutated form is observed in some neuronal perikarya and proximal nerve processes but is not detectable in nerve endings. Our results suggest that the expression or processing of the mutated huntingtin in perikarya and nerve endings differs quantitatively or qualitatively from the expression of the normal form in the same neuronal compartments.",

It affects both sexes and age at onset of the disease may be different but usually occurs in midlife. The term Juvenile Huntington's disease is generally applied to 10% of the cases with onset before 20. We present clinical features and results of DNA analysis in 16 patients from 14 families aged 9 to 36. The age of onset was between 5 to 20 years; duration of the disease was from 2 to 16 years. In 10 cases the mutated gene was transmitted by the affected father; only in two cases by the mother. In all cases anticipation manifested by earlier onset of the disease in subsequent generations and expansion of CAG repeats was documented. The number of CAG repeats was between 50 and 92 (mean 67.3). Progressive mental deterioration, declining school performance, hyperactivity and emotional disturbances were the first symptoms of juvenile HD. Neuropsychological assessment showed mean IQ in Wechsler test 59.6 and Mini-Mental State Examination scores 22.8. Rigidity and bradykinesia were predominant features in the cases with juvenile onset, the remaining ones developed choreatic movements. Three persons had epileptic seizures; two (both females) revealed behaviour and psychiatric disturbances. Amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potentials, visual evoked potentials and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were markedly reduced.

The IT-15 gene encodes the huntingtin (Htt) protein. Htt, along with its interacting partners, are involved in maintaining proper communication among neurons. Our work is based on the interaction behavior between Htt (in three polyglutamine (polyQ) states that is Htt 0Q, 17Q and 36Q) and SH3GL3 interacting protein by using computational methods. We used the HADDOCK docking platform to find out the extent of interaction between Htt polyQ models and SH3GL3. The Htt36Q (mutated) showed higher interaction than Htt17Q (native) with SH3GL3. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to uncover the structural fluctuations of polyQ models and their complexes. RMSD, Rg, SASA, and total interaction energy graph showed significant results, where as mutant Htt showed higher fluctuations and flexibility than native Htt. The increase in the length of polyQ was found to affect the stability, flexibility, and compactness of the protein and its complex.

Huntington's disease is a clinical diagnosis. The advent of DNA diagnosis has made predictive, prenatal and preimplantation testing possible for at-risk persons or asymptomatic carriers. The prevalence is estimated to be 3-10/100,000 among individuals of European descent; HD is less common in other ethnic groups. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the HD gene on chromosome 4. The gene encodes for the protein huntingtin, with an as yet unknown function. The mutated huntingtin has an elongated stretch of glutamines which leads to a gain of function such as overactivity, excitotoxicity, or to interactions with other proteins.",

One recent immunocytochemical study suggested that the IT15 protein preferentially localizes to the nucleus of affected neuronal cells. If this result is accurate, it could link the biochemical function of this protein to nuclear activities such as gene regulation. To examine the nuclear transport of the Huntington disease protein, we searched for basic peptide motifs that could produce nuclear localization. One peptide (RRKGKEK) was identified that is highly homologous to a consensus nuclear localization signal. When fused to the cytoplasmic reporter protein, beta-galactosidase, nuclear localization was observed in stably transformed human cell lines. In a complementary study, an anti-peptide polyclonal antibody, raised against a sequence adjacent to the putative nuclear localization sequence, detected the IT15 protein in the nucleus of human cells. These results extend and confirm the previous localization studies and identify an IT15 peptide motif that can function for nuclear localization.",

Our data demonstrate that Linc-pint expression is lower in plasma samples from PCa patients than from healthy individuals, and indicate that plasma Linc-pint levels are more sensitive than CA19-9 for detecting PCa. Our data also show that Linc-pint levels are lower in PCa tumors than in adjacent tissues, carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (CAV) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and suggest that Linc-pint could be used for distinguishing the cause of malignant obstructive jaundice. Low plasma Linc-pint levels correlate with tumor recurrence, while low tumor Linc-pint levels correlate with poor prognosis for PCa patients after pancreatectomy.

Areas covered: This review focuses on the preclinical discovery of pimavanserin. It analyzes the pharmacological, behavioral and molecular mechanisms of pimavanserin and their contribution to the therapeutic advantages of the drug as reported in published preclinical and clinical studies, press releases and product labels. Expert opinion: Pimavanserin exhibits a unique pharmacological profile with nanomolar affinity at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Functionally, it acts as a potent inverse agonist at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, with selectivity over 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and no appreciable activity at other neurotransmitter receptors. Behavioral studies found that pimavanserin reversed impaired behaviors in animal models predictive of antipsychotic activity, and with no impairment of motor functions. The drug exhibits long plasma half-life (57 hours), which support its once/day administration. A pivotal phase III clinical trial demonstrated significant improvement in PDP symptoms in patients receiving pimavanserin compared to placebo-treated patients. The drug also displayed relatively benign safety and tolerability profiles. Pimavanserin's mechanism of action might contribute to its unique psychopharmacological properties in the improved treatment of PDP, and perhaps psychosis in other diseases including schizophrenia and dementia-related psychosis.",

They can transfer information between cells and may cause pathology, for example, a role for exosomes has been proposed in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Although studied in several biofluids, exosomes have not been extensively studied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from humans. The objective of this study was to determine: 1) whether human CSF contains exosomes and 2) the variability in exosomal protein content across individuals. CSF was collected from 5 study participants undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (around 200 - 500 ml per participant) and low-density membrane vesicles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes was determined by western blot for marker proteins, isopycnic centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient and transmission electron microscopy with immuno-labelling. Whole protein profiling was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR). Flotillin 1 and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), two exosomal marker proteins, were identified in the ultracentrifugation pellet using western blot. These markers localized to a density consistent with exosomes following isopycnic centrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy visualized structures consistent with exosomes in size and appearance that labelled positive for flotillin 1. Therefore, the pellet that resulted from ultracentrifugation of human CSF contained exosomes. FT-ICR profiling of this pellet was performed and 84-161 ions were detected per study participant. Around one third of these ions were only present in a single study participant and one third were detected in all five. With regard to ion quantity, the median coefficient of variation was 81% for ions detected in two or more samples. Exosomes were identified in human CSF and their proteome is a potential new reservoir for biomarker discovery in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, techniques used to concentrate exosomes from CSF need refinement to reduce variability. In this study we used relatively large starting volumes of human CSF, future studies will focus on exosome isolation from smaller 'real life' clinical samples; a key challenge in the development of exosomes as translational tools.",

The results showed that six SCAN-KRAB-containing ZNFs are KAP1-independent transcriptional repressors whose SCAN-KRAB domain is unable to associate with KAP1 despite retaining transcriptional repression activity. Transcriptional repression activities of the SCAN-KRAB domain of KAP1-independent KRAB-ZNFs are not influenced by depletion of endogenous KAP1 levels by small interfering RNA. Although the mechanism by which KAP1-independent KRAB-ZNFs repress transcriptional activity remains to be elucidated, it appears that there may be a pathway for transcriptional repression that does not involve KAP1. These results provide new insight into the functions of the members of the KRAB-ZNF family.",

Tripartite motif protein 28 (TRIM28), a universal mediator of Kr\u00fcppel-associated box domain zinc fingers (KRAB-ZNFs), is known to regulate both processes; however, the exact mechanism and identity of participating KRAB-ZNF genes remain unknown. Here, using a reporter system, we show that TRIM28/KRAB-ZNFs alter DNA methylation patterns in addition to H3K9me3 to cause stable gene repression during reprogramming. Using several expression datasets, we identified KRAB-ZNFs (ZNF114, ZNF483, ZNF589) in the human genome that maintain pluripotency. Moreover, we identified target genes repressed by these KRAB-ZNFs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these KRAB-ZNFs directly alter gene expression of important developmental genes by modulating H3K9me3 and DNA methylation of their promoters. In summary, TRIM28 employs KRAB-ZNFs to evoke epigenetic silencing of its target differentiation genes via H3K9me3 and DNA methylation.",

We have adapted the DamID method to systematically identify target genes of the heterochromatin proteins HP1 and SUV39H1 in human and mouse cells. Unexpectedly, we found that CBX1 (formerly HP1beta) and SUV39H1 bind to genes encoding KRAB domain containing zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) transcriptional repressors. These genes constitute one of the largest gene families and are organized in clusters in the human genome. Preference of CBX1 for this gene family was observed in both human and mouse cells. High-resolution mapping on human chromosome 19 revealed that CBX1 coats large domains 0.1-4 Mb in size, which coincide with the position of KRAB-ZNF gene clusters. These domains show an intricate CBX1 binding pattern: While CBX1 is globally elevated throughout the domains, it is absent from the promoters and binds more strongly to the 3' ends of KRAB-ZNF genes. KRAB-ZNF domains contain large numbers of LINE elements, which may contribute to CBX1 recruitment. These results uncover a surprising link between heterochromatin and a large family of regulatory genes in mammals. We suggest a role for heterochromatin in the evolution of the KRAB-ZNF gene family.",

KRAB zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) transcription factor genes are overrepresented among genes contained within these recent human SDs. Here, we examine the structural and functional diversity of the 70 human KRAB-ZNF genes involved in the most recent primate SD events including genes that arose in the hominid lineage. Despite their recent advent, many parent-daughter KRAB-ZNF gene pairs display significant differences in zinc finger structure and sequence, expression, and splicing patterns, each of which could significantly alter the regulatory functions of the paralogous genes. Paralogs that emerged on the lineage to humans and chimpanzees have undergone more evolutionary changes per unit of time than genes already present in the common ancestor of rhesus macaques and great apes. Taken together, these data indicate that a substantial fraction of the recently evolved primate-specific KRAB-ZNF gene duplicates have acquired novel functions that may possibly define novel regulatory pathways and suggest an active ongoing selection for regulatory diversity in primates.",

Despite remarkable advances in the identification of loci involved in Drosophila speciation, little is known about the genes, functions, and biochemical interactions of the molecules underlying hybrid sterility and inviability in mammals. Here, we discuss the main evolutionary and molecular features that make transcription factors (TFs), especially the family of zinc finger proteins with a Kr\u00fcppel-associated box domain (KRAB-ZNF), strong candidates to play an important role in postzygotic reproductive isolation. Motivated by the recent identification of the gene encoding PR domain zinc finger protein 9 (Prdm9; a KRAB-ZNF gene) as the first hybrid sterility gene identified in mammals, we further propose integrative approaches to study KRAB-ZNF genes with the main goal of characterizing the molecular pathways and interactions involved in hybrid incompatibilities.",

The proteins encoded by these genes, whose expression is often tissue-specific, act as epigenetic suppressors contributing to the addition of repressive chromatin marks and DNA methylation. Due to its high complexity, the KRAB-ZNF family has not been studied in sufficient detail, and the involvement of its members in carcinogenesis remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs using publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer datasets. We analyzed 6727 tumor and normal tissue samples from 16 cancer types. Here, we showed that a small but distinctive cluster of 16 KRAB-ZNFs is commonly upregulated across multiple cancer cohorts in comparison to normal samples. We confirmed these observations in the independent panels of lung and breast cancer cell lines and tissues. This upregulation was also observed for most of the KRAB-ZNF splicing variants, whose expression is simultaneously upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues. Finally, by analyzing the clinicopathological data for breast and lung cancers, we demonstrated that the expression of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs correlates with patient survival, tumor histology, and molecular subtyping. Altogether, our study allowed the identification and characterization of KRAB-ZNF factors that may have an essential function in cancer biology and thus potential to become novel oncologic biomarkers and treatment targets.",

Areas covered: In the last two decades, BCR/ABL1 kinase has become the molecular target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a class of drugs that impressively improved overall survival. Despite these results, a proportion of patients experiences resistance to TKIs and need to change treatment. Furthermore, TKIs are unable to eradicate leukemic stem cells, allowing the persistence of neoplastic clones. Therefore, there is still clinical need for new agents to overcome common resistance mechanisms to available drugs. This review explores the horizon of drugs actually under investigation for CML patients resistant to conventional treatment. Expert commentary: Radotinib is an ATP-competitive TKI that showed significant activity also in front-line setting and could find employment indications in CML. Asciminib, an allosteric ABL1 inhibitor, could demonstrate a higher capacity in overcoming common TKIs resistant mutations, including T315I, but clinical findings are needed.

Acquired drug resistance in mutant Bcr-Abl has enhanced pathogenesis with the use of single therapy agents such as nilotinib. Moreover, allosteric targeting has been identified to consequentially inhibit Bcr-Abl activity, which led to the recent development of ABL-001 (asciminib) that selectively binds the myristoyl pocket. Experimental studies have revealed that the combination of nilotinib and ABL-001 induced a 'bent' conformation in the C-terminal helix of Bcr-Abl; a benchmark of inhibition, thereby exhibiting a greater potency in the treatment of CML, surmounting the setbacks of drug resistance, disease regression and relapse. Therefore, we report the first account of the dynamics and conformational analysis of oncogenic T334I Bcr-Abl by dual targeting. Our findings revealed that unlike in the Bcr-Abl-Nilotinib complex, dual targeting by both inhibitors induced the bent conformation in the C-terminal helix that varied with time. This was coupled with significant alteration in Bcr-Abl stability, flexibility, and compactness and an overall structural re-orientation inwards towards the hydrophobic core, which reduced the solvent-exposed residues indicative of protein folding. This study will facilitate allosteric targeting and the design of more potent allosteric inhibitors for resistive target proteins in cancer.",

We describe the discovery of asciminib (ABL001), the first allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor to reach the clinic. Asciminib binds to the myristate pocket of BCR-ABL1 and maintains activity against TKI-resistant ATP-site mutations. Although resistance can emerge due to myristate-site mutations, these are sensitive to ATP-competitive inhibitors so that combinations of asciminib with ATP-competitive TKIs suppress the emergence of resistance. Fragment-based screening using NMR and X-ray yielded ligands for the myristate pocket. An NMR-based conformational assay guided the transformation of these inactive ligands into ABL1 inhibitors.

This syndrome usually presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain mimicking other hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal pathologies, hence, posing a diagnostic dilemma in settings with limited diagnostic tools. A 32 year old African female presented with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain and vaginal discharge, for which she had previously received treatment in another health center with no improvement. Clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. Five days after treatment with oral doxycycline, the patient showed marked clinical improvement.

It can be caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis infections. FHC syndrome usually presents with pain in the right hypochondrium and fever, associated with symptoms and signs of pelvic infection in women. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 22-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) who presented with polyarthritis, cutaneous lesions, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of FHC syndrome was based on the findings of abdominal computerized tomography (CT) and the isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in blood cultures. The association of arthritis and cutaneous lesions was diagnosed as a syndrome of arthritis-dermatitis, also caused by systemic NG infection. The patient had a favorable outcome with antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS FHC syndrome should be considered in sexually active young patients, mainly women, with pelvic infection and perihepatitis. It may be caused by disseminated gonococcal infection. An important risk factor is the serum complement deficit, which may predispose to severe forms. Low serum complement level is a frequent manifestation of active SLE. CT images showing the typical findings of perihepatitis allow making the correct diagnosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26774818": " There are a lot of different causes of abdominal pain; in this case, a young woman suffers from three diseases with similar symptoms. Adult intestinal mal-rotation is a rare condition of deviation from the normal 270\u00b0 counter clockwise rotation of the midgut resulting in, not only mal-position of the small intestine, but also mal-fixation of the mesentery. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease; it involves liver capsule inflammation associated with genital tract infection, which is usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis. Neuroendocrine tumors are enterochromaffin cell neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems; the appendicular one is the most common primary malignant lesion of these tumors, it's incidence is about 0.3 - 0.9% of appendectomies done. Just for knowledge, this is the first described case of concomitant presence of all these diseases with clinical symptoms attributable to each one. 40-years-old woman suffers from acute abdominal pain, predominantly on the right quadrants, without abdominal distension, no guarding nor rigidity and normal intestinal peristalsis. She has a long history of abdominal intermittent pain, with cramps every 30-40 min, resolving spontaneously. She was diagnosed as intestinal mal-rotation through computed tomography scan which has evidenced a mobilized intra--peritoneal duodenum with cecum/ascending colon predominately lying on the left side and the small intestine almost entirely lying on the right side of abdomen, without evidence of effusion, edema or signs of intestinal ischemia or infarction. Exploratory laparoscopy demonstrated an inflammatory process in the hepatic-renal space, with bloody adhesions above the liver capsule; this is additional to the typical pelvic inflammatory disease signs (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome). Appendectomy was performed with histological analysis resulting in appendicular neuroendocrine tumor. Although the patient has an intestinal mal-rotation which could explain the abdominal painful symptoms, it is not possible to exclude other concomitant causes, such as perihepatitis on pelvic inflammatory disease or neuroendocrine tumors. Even if all these diseases are rarely seen in daily clinical practice, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic intermittent abdominal pain in a young woman.",

In the acute phase, patients usually complain of severe right upper quadrant pain of sudden onset. The pain is sharp, pleuritic and most intense at the level of the right lower rib margin and thus it is frequently confused with acute cholecystitis or pleurisy. Definitive diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome needs invasive procedures such as laparoscopy or laparotomy, but considering that Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a benign condition that can be cured by oral administration of appropriate antibiotics, noninvasive diagnosis is desirable. Recently, we have experienced two cases of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome in acute phase accompanied with sharp and pleuritic right upper quadrant pain. In one case, pelvic inflammatory disease was not definite, so at first we mistook it for acute cholecystitis and reactivation of chronic hepatitis B. In the other case, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome followed the preceding, typical pelvic inflammatory disease. Both cases were diagnosed noninvasively and treated successfully by oral administration of antibiotics.",

The clinical courses of patients that visited St. Mary's Hospital with abdominal pain from January 2005 to December 2006 and were diagnosed with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome were examined. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome was identified in 22 female patients of childbearing age; their mean age was 31.0+/-8.1 years. Fourteen of these cases presented with pain in the upper right abdomen alone or together with pain in the lower abdomen, and six patients presented with pain only in the lower abdomen. The first impression at the time of visit was acute cholecystitis or cholangitis in 10 patients and acute appendicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease in eight patients. Twenty-one patients were diagnosed by abdominal computer tomography (CT), and the results of abdominal sonography were normal for 10 of these patients. Chlamydia trichomatis was isolated from 18 patients. Two patients underwent laparoscopic adhesiotomy and 20 patients were completely cured by antibiotic treatment. For women of childbearing age with acute pain in the upper right abdomen alone or together with pain in the lower abdomen, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome should be considered during differential diagnosis.

The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions.

However, the recent classification of BS at a crossroads between autoimmune and autoinflammatory syndromes has paved the way to new further therapeutic opportunities in addition to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. This review provides a digest of all current experience and evidence about pharmacological agents recently described as having a role in the treatment of BS, including interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitors, tocilizumab, rituximab, alemtuzumab, ustekinumab, interferon-alpha-2a, and apremilast. IL-1 inhibitors currently represent the most studied agents among the latest treatment options for BS, proving to be effective, safe and with an acceptable retention on treatment. However, since BS is a peculiar disorder with clinical features responding to certain treatments that in turn can worsen other manifestations, identifying new treatment options for patients unresponsive to the current drug armamentarium is of great relevance. A number of agents have been studied in the last decade showing changing fortunes in some cases and promising results in others.

Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that modulates several inflammatory pathways. We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in which 111 patients with Beh\u00e7et's syndrome who had two or more oral ulcers were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of apremilast twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. This regimen was followed by a 12-week extension phase in which the placebo group was switched to apremilast and a 28-day post-treatment observational follow-up phase. The patients and clinicians were unaware of the study assignments throughout the trial. The primary end point was the number of oral ulcers at week 12. Secondary outcomes included pain from these ulcers (measured on a 100-mm visual-analogue scale, with higher scores indicating worse pain), the number of genital ulcers, overall disease activity, and quality of life. The mean (\u00b1SD) number of oral ulcers per patient at week 12 was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the placebo group (0.5\u00b11.0 vs. 2.1\u00b12.6) (P&lt;0.001).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27035942": "DNA damage repair starts with the recognition of damaged sites from predominantly normal DNA. In eukaryotes, diverse DNA lesions from environmental sources are recognized by the xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) nucleotide excision repair complex. Studies of Rad4 (radiation-sensitive 4; yeast XPC ortholog) showed that Rad4 \"opens\" up damaged DNA by inserting a \u03b2-hairpin into the duplex and flipping out two damage-containing nucleotide pairs. However, this DNA lesion \"opening\" is slow (\u02dc5-10 ms) compared with typical submillisecond residence times per base pair site reported for various DNA-binding proteins during 1D diffusion on DNA. To address the mystery as to how Rad4 pauses to recognize lesions during diffusional search, we examine conformational dynamics along the lesion recognition trajectory using temperature-jump spectroscopy. Besides identifying the \u02dc10-ms step as the rate-limiting bottleneck towards opening specific DNA site, we uncover an earlier \u02dc100- to 500-\u03bcs step that we assign to nonspecific deformation (unwinding/\"twisting\") of DNA by Rad4. The \u03b2-hairpin is not required to unwind or to overcome the bottleneck but is essential for full nucleotide-flipping. We propose that Rad4 recognizes lesions in a step-wise \"twist-open\" mechanism, in which preliminary twisting represents Rad4 interconverting between search and interrogation modes. Through such conformational switches compatible with rapid diffusion on DNA, Rad4 may stall preferentially at a lesion site, offering time to open DNA. This study represents the first direct observation, to our knowledge, of dynamical DNA distortions during search/interrogation beyond base pair breathing. Submillisecond interrogation with preferential stalling at cognate sites may be common to various DNA-binding proteins.",

How XPC detects structurally diverse lesions embedded within normal DNA is unknown. Here we present a crystal structure that captures the yeast XPC orthologue (Rad4) on a single register of undamaged DNA. The structure shows that a disulphide-tethered Rad4 flips out normal nucleotides and adopts a conformation similar to that seen with damaged DNA. Contrary to many DNA repair enzymes that can directly reject non-target sites as structural misfits, our results suggest that Rad4/XPC uses a kinetic gating mechanism whereby lesion selectivity arises from the kinetic competition between DNA opening and the residence time of Rad4/XPC per site. This mechanism is further supported by measurements of Rad4-induced lesion-opening times using temperature-jump perturbation spectroscopy. Kinetic gating may be a general mechanism used by site-specific DNA-binding proteins to minimize time-consuming interrogations of non-target sites.",

Here we present the crystal structure of the yeast XPC orthologue Rad4 bound to DNA containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesion. The structure shows that Rad4 inserts a beta-hairpin through the DNA duplex, causing the two damaged base pairs to flip out of the double helix. The expelled nucleotides of the undamaged strand are recognized by Rad4, whereas the two CPD-linked nucleotides become disordered. These findings indicate that the lesions recognized by Rad4/XPC thermodynamically destabilize the Watson-Crick double helix in a manner that facilitates the flipping-out of two base pairs.",

This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications. To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA shunts.To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA shunting. We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME).We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August 2014. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim-Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA shunts. Two review authors independently screened search results, selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data. Only one study met the inclusion criteria: an RCT comparing effectiveness of ETV and non-programmable VP shunts in 42 patients with iNPH. The study was conducted in Brazil between 2009 and 2012. The overall study risk of bias was high. The primary outcome in the study was the proportion of patients with improved symptoms one year after surgery, determined as a change of at least two points on the Japanese NPH scale. Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference between groups in the proportion of patients who improved 3 or 12 months after surgery (3 months: odds ration (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.76, n = 42; 12 months: OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.62 to 10.11, n = 38). We were unable to estimate the effect of treatment on other efficacy outcomes (cognition, balance, function, gait and mobility) because they were inadequately reported. Of the 26 patients in the VP shunting group, 5 developed subdural hematoma postoperatively, while there were no complications among the 16 patients in the ETV group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.3, n = 42), but the estimate was too imprecise to determine whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. This was also the case for rates of further surgical intervention (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.24, n = 42). There were no deaths during the trial. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be very low because of a high risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias and serious imprecision in the results. The only randomised trial of ETV for iNPH compares it to an intervention which is not a standard practice (VP shunting using a non-programmable valve). The evidence from this study is inconclusive and of very low quality. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the evidence.

From the 43 initially sorted, only 13 have been selected using exclusion criteria. The proposed methods are very sparse and focused on the improvement after surgical shunt. This focus is independent from the diagnosis criteria proposed in 2005. This introduces an ambiguity in the interpretation of the results. In practice, the diagnosis of NPH is more difficult in the elderly population where differential diagnoses are frequent, particularly vascular lesions (notably microangiopathy) and Alzheimer's disease. The more invasive techniques as continuous spinal drainage (usually during 3 days) or some features of CSF dynamics (Rout, compliance) seem to be the best predictors of after shunt improvement. However, these techniques are difficult to use in routine in the elderly. The combination of Evans index and corpus callosum angle on MRI is very useful to improve the differential diagnosis with cerebral atrophy. Spinal tap test (lumbar puncture with the removal of 40 mL of CSF) can be repeated two or three times for consecutive days to improve the predictive value before shunting. Gait and balance often improve after shunt, more than cognition and bladder disorders. In the elderly population, the prognosis after 3 years is non conclusive despite initial improvement. Poor prognosis seems to be due to associated pathologies in particular neurodegenerative diseases. This should be considered in decision-making of CSF shunt.",

Although it was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, there is no formal definition of NPH, causing discrepancy in its incidence in various studies. This ranges from 2 to 20 per million per year. It is estimated to be the cause of about 5% of cases of dementia and is one of the few reversible causes of dementia. Early diagnosis increases the rate of success to treatment. This makes accurate diagnosis and identification of responders to treatment important. There have been various studies on NPH in the general population, but not much has been said about it in long-term care facilities and the question arises on how many cases are missed. If a screening tool is in place to identify possible cases then further workup could be done to confirm the diagnosis and determine the need for shunting.",

The recognition of this association is important because these two entities require specific therapeutic approaches. The presence of Parkinson's disease does not preclude an excellent response of the hydrocephalus to a shunting procedure. Although several reports of cases with the characteristic clinical manifestations of normal pressure hydrocephalus--progressive dementia, gait difficulty and urinary incontinence--have been published earlier, it was Adams and Hakim who emphasized the clinical triad and the effect of shunting the cerebrospinal fluid as a means of treatment. Messert and Baker stressed that the gait disturbance had a close resemblance to the freezing gait of parkinsonism. We are reporting three patients who had both conditions. Recognition of the existence of both disorders in the same patients is important since appropriate treatment of each of them led to marked improvement of their symptoms.",

Aqueductal stenosis caused by DVAs is so rare that only 14 cases have been reported to date. Moreover, most patients are children or young adults, presenting with headaches or consciousness disturbances, associated with raised intracranial pressure. Here, we report on an 83-year-old man presenting with mimic symptoms of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was recorded to be 10 cm-H<sub>2</sub>O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in Hakim's triad.",

Therefore, co-administration of selective and non-toxic ABCG2 inhibitors is a promising strategy for improving the efficacy of chemotherapy by blocking ABCG2-mediated export of the cytostatic drugs. In the present study, we designed a small library of 38 novel compounds containing a heteroaryl-phenyl scaffold possessing several (bioisosteric) moieties, and twelve new precursors. We investigated the library for ABCG2 inhibition, for the selectivity against MDR-involved efflux pump ABCB1 (P-gp) and for toxicity. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that, at least a phenylheteroaryl-phenylamide scaffold is necessary for observing an ABCG2 inhibition. 4-Methoxy-N-(2-(2-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)benzamide (43) exhibited a high potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 61 nM)), selectivity, low intrinsic toxicity and reversed the ABCG2-mediated drug resistance in presence of only 0.1 \u03bcM.",

The ABC transporters are also recognized as important contributors to pharmacokinetics, especially in drug-drug interactions and adverse drug effects. Drugs and xenobiotics, as well as pathologic conditions, can influence the transcription of ABC transporters, or modify their activity or intracellular localization. Kinases can affect the aforementioned processes for ABC transporters as do protein interactions. In this review, we focus on the ABC transporters ABCB1, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC4, and ABCG2 and illustrate how kinases and protein-protein interactions affect these transporters. The clinical relevance of these factors is currently unknown; however, these examples suggest that our understanding of drug-drug interactions will benefit from further knowledge of how kinases and protein-protein interactions affect ABC transporters.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021380": "The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family is a large class of ATP energy-dependent transmembrane proteins, and its primary function is to use the energy produced by ATP hydrolysis to transfer the substrate bound to the plasma membrane. This family is also closely related to multidrug resistance (MDR) in various diseases. Among the ABC transporter proteins, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are the main members associated with MDR. At present, the roles of these transporters in therapeutic failures have been extensively studied and reviewed in cancer; however, they have rarely been described in autoimmune diseases (AIDs). AID is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases of unknown aetiology. AID's basic feature is the production of a large number of autoantibodies, which leads to extensive damage to multiple systems and multiple organs. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are commonly used in the treatment of AID, but a considerable number of patients have no response or develop resistance to these drugs over time. This phenomenon may be related to the abnormal expression of the ABC transporter, which leads to a decrease in the amount of drug entering cells that produce MDR. This article reviews the effects of DMARDs on the expression and function of P-gp, MRPs, and BCRP and the related molecular mechanism in the treatment of AID.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze the association of clinicopathologic characteristics with treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of patients who developed RIOSM after undergoing radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We reviewed the medical records of 53,760 NPC patients admitted to Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center during the period August 1964 to August 2012. Of these patients, 47 who developed RISOM and met inclusion criteria were included in this study. Two of these 47 patients refused treatment and were then excluded. For all patients treated for NPC at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center during the study period, the total incidence of RIOSM after radiotherapy was 0.084% (47/53,760). Two patients (4.4%) had metastases at the diagnosis of RIOSM. Thirty-nine of the 45 (86.7%) patients underwent surgery for RIOSM; most patients (24/39; 61.5%) who underwent resection had gross clear margins, with 15 patients (38.5%) having either a gross or microscopic positive margin. All patients died. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates for the entire cohort of 45 patients were 53.3%, 35.6% and 13.5%, respectively. The independent prognostic factors associated with high OS rate were tumor size and treatment type. RISOM after radiotherapy for NPC is aggressive and often eludes early detection and timely intervention. Surgery combined with postoperative chemotherapy might be an effective treatment to improve patient survival.",

We performed dosimetric analysis by superimposing the patient's original treatment field on a CT scan performed after the diagnosis. The radiotherapy dose for this patient is lower than classically reported for radiation induced sarcomas. We identified greatest bony destruction that was thought to be the epicenter of the tumor, and this was specially contoured on the diagnostic CT scan. This volume appears to be located at the edge of the radiotherapy field. Fifty percent of the treated volume received 240 cGy, the mean dose was 333 cGy.

In retinoblastoma survivors who subsequently developed osteosarcoma, the age at onset of retinoblastoma was young (average of 12 months) in both unilateral and bilateral forms. This suggests that all or almost all of the patients were genetically predisposed by a mutation of one allele of the RB1 gene. For retinoblastoma patients, osteosarcomas occurred 1.2 years earlier inside than outside the radiation field. The latency period between radiotherapy and osteosarcoma onset was 1.3 years shorter inside than outside the radiation field. Interestingly, a bimodal distribution of latency periods was observed for osteosarcomas arising inside, but not outside the radiation field: 40% occurred after a short latency, while the latency of the remaining 60% was comparable to that of osteosarcoma occurring outside the radiation field. This suggests that different mechanisms may be involved in radiocarcinogenesis. A radiation-induced mutation of the second RB1 allele may be the cause of osteosarcomas occurring after a short delay, while other genes may be affected in those occurring after a longer delay.",

Data from 175 patients with a history of sarcoma of the head at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1975 to 2007 were reviewed to identify patients with radiation-induced osteosarcoma. The diagnostic criteria were: 1) osteosarcoma arose within the previously irradiated field; 2) new sarcoma was histologically distinct from the original neoplasm; 3) no evidence of new sarcoma at the time of radiation; and 4) distinct latency period could be recognized. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were obtained for the various characteristics under study. The authors identified 16 patients with radiation-induced osteosarcoma of the cranium at their institution. The average age at diagnosis was 35 years. The median latency period was 12.5 years. Nine patients had skull base tumors, and 7 had calvarial tumors. Of the 14 patients treated surgically, 86% developed local recurrence.

Hall and A.J. Giaccia [1]. Although the concepts of direct and indirect effects of radiation are fully applicable to low-LET (linear energy transfer) radioresistant tumor cells/normal tissues such as osteosarcoma cells and chondrocytes, it is believed that radiation-associated damage to DNA does not play a major role in the mechanism of cell death in low-LET radiosensitive tumors/normal tissues such as malignant lymphoma cells and lymphocytes. Hall and Giaccia describe lymphocytes as very radiosensitive, based largely on apoptosis subsequent to irradiation. As described in this review, apoptosis of lymphocytes and lymphoma cells is actually induced by the \"hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082) effect\", which I propose in this review article for the first time. The mechanism of lymphocyte death via the H\u2082O\u2082 effect represents an ideal model to develop the enhancement method of radiosensitivity for radiation therapy of malignant neoplasms. In terms of imitating the high radiosensitivity of lymphocytes, osteosarcoma cells (representative of low-LET radioresistant cells) might be the ideal model for indicating the conversion of cells from radioresistant to radiosensitive utilizing the H\u2082O\u2082 effect. External beam radiation such as X-rays and high-energy electrons for use in modern radiotherapy are generally produced using a linear accelerator. We theorized that when tumors are irradiated in the presence of H\u2082O\u2082, the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes such as peroxidases and catalase are blocked and oxygen molecules are produced at the same time via the H\u2082O\u2082 effect, resulting in oxidative damage to low-LET radioresistant tumor cells, thereby rendering them highly sensitive to irradiation. In this review, this potential paradigm shift in modern radiation biology/radiation oncology is discussed in detail in terms of overcoming drug/radiation resistance in radiation therapy and/or anti-cancer chemotherapy.",

Sixteen years later, in September 2006, the patient noted an enlarging subcutaneous mass in the right frontal region. CT showed an osteolytic mass in the right frontal sinus. An open biopsy established the histopathological diagnosis of osteosarcoma, and the patient subsequently died of rapid tumor regrowth. Case 2 was a 58-year-old man who underwent partial removal of a bifrontal tumor in May 1996. The histological diagnosis was anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and radiotherapy of 56 Gy was administered. Twelve years later, in March 2008, the patient was readmitted to our hospital for reasons of marked deterioration in general physical condition. Tumor recurrence was suspected in the left frontal lobe, and CT demonstrated an osteolytic mass in the left frontal and ethmoid sinus.

My topics are etiology, herniosis, diverticulosis coli, and cancer. Hippocrates blamed wear and tear for herniation. Russell's (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) explanation was congenital peritoneal \"buds\" extending down to the pelvis. Harrison (Arch Surg 4:680-689, 1922) attributed herniae to transversalis fascial degradation. Keith (Lancet 2(17):1398-1399, 1906) concluded that pathology was involved, even though Russell (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) had denied it. Nevertheless, the congenital theory prevailed. According to McVay (Christopher's textbook of surgery, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1960, p. 159), defects arise in normal musculo-aponeurotic structures. Research showed that atrophy was caused by damaged fibroblasts producing less collagen, which was abnormal (having a reduced I/III ratio). The disease was systemic, later named herniosis. Nicotine addiction increased the incidence of herniation by an inflammatory process named metastatic emphysema. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced. This association occurred eight times more often than expected, with herniosis appearing to be its cause, abetted by high blood cholesterol causing gallstones. In 2006, Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) provided evidence that colon cancer is accompanied by a reduction in diverticula. Klinge et al. (Hernia 8(4):300-301, 2004) showed that these entities require different extracellular matrices (ECMs). Ghajar and Bissell (Histochem Cell Biol 130:1105-1118, 2008) pointed out that the ECM, which comprises 80% of the breast, influences its epithelial genetic expression, likewise with other organs (kidney, skin, lung, colon, and ovaries). Recently, a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer growth and metastasis has taken place. Whereas the degradation of connective tissue was thought to encourage invasion, eliciting concern for the herniated, now, investigators report the reverse, a reactive vascularized stroma resembling wound healing with an increase in fibroblasts and collagen I. Words such as desmoplasia, fibrosis, and stiffening abound. In conclusion, degradation of the ECM may be why herniosis appears to be hostile to the development of cancer throughout the body. Studies are needed of patients with and without a history of hernia to determine their incidence of cancer. Data from smokers should be separated, since they carry their own high risk of malignancy.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19921348": "Research by herniologists from around the world has shown that abdominal defects, in the adult, are not caused by wear and tear but systemic hernial disease (herniosis), a disorder of connective tissue which affects the extracellular matrix (ECM). Wound healing may be affected, leading to recurrences after hernia repair or primary incisional herniation. Women with genitourinary prolapse show signs of herniosis in the pelvis. Diverticulosis coli, commonly seen in the elderly, like hernia, was once attributed to stress and strain from constipation. It is now suspected that herniosis weakens the colonic ECM, allowing the mucosa to form diverticula by herniating alongside the vasa recta. Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae. Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) reported that diverticula and cancer are rarely coincident in the colon, despite aging. Their data indicate that the two pathologies arise in different ECMs. Klinge et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 22:515-520, 2007), quoting Paget (Lancet 1:571-573, 1889), \"Tumor cells can like seeds only grow if they fall on congenial soil,\" suggested that certain genes prevent stromal malignancy by influencing the microenvironment to stop epithelia from becoming cancerous. Thus, damage to the colonic ECM from hernial disease is conducive to diverticulosis, but hostile for cancer. Hernial disease being systemic, a similar ECM should be present throughout the body. Coincident diverticulosis and herniae support this hypothesis. Its validation requires further research involving the lifetime risk of cancer in patients with and without hernia. Since smoking causes both herniation and cancer, data from indulgers will have to be analyzed separately from abstainers.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704619": " Sixty years ago, Saint's triad (hiatus hernia, diverticulosis of the colon, and gallbladder disease) was first described in three patients. Since then, the association of these conditions has been questioned. We tested the hypothesis that these conditions are associated, and, based on recent research, propose a common etiology. Data from the U.S. Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 16 Data Warehouse were analyzed. Chi-square tests and calculated odds ratios (ORs) were utilized to describe the magnitude of association, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the variables associated with Saint's triad. Among 637,518 patient records (1996-2005), any hernia was diagnosed among 22,181 (3.5%) patients, hiatus hernia among 1,661 (0.3%), diverticulosis of the colon among 14,375 (2.3%), and gallbladder disease among 5,284 (0.8%). The following associations were observed: diverticulosis, hiatus hernia (OR: 6.9), hiatus hernia, gallbladder disease (OR = 3.8), and gallbladder disease, diverticulosis (OR = 5.9). Patients with both diverticulosis and gallbladder disease were more likely to have hiatus hernia (OR = 3.8; P = 0.0012) or any hernia (OR = 10.7; P &lt; 0.0001). Diseases associated with Saint's triad (incorporating any hernia) included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 4.3), hypertension (OR = 3.1), aortic aneurysm (OR = 2.2), and diabetes (OR = 1.8). Herniosis, the systemic connective tissue disease known to cause diverticulosis and herniae, may be responsible for Saint's triad. Diabetes, like aging, enhanced herniosis. Further research on the gallbladder wall pathology in patients with cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is needed.",

Though each component of this syndrome is fairly common, the Saint's triad is relatively seldom encountered. It does happen so because not all the components are likely to cause clinical symptoms. Consequently diagnosis and subsequent therapy are targeted at the dominating symptoms. On the other hand, the existence of the syndrome is also not sufficiently known in clinical practice. Authors stress that in the event of simultaneous symptoms suggestive of atypic cholelithiasis, colonic diverticulosis and hiatus hernia one has to consider a potential Saint's triad. Therefore it is recommended to verify or exclude each of the three components to establish a precise diagnosis and adequate subsequent therapy.",

Methods Three to 6 patients were enrolled into sequentially escalating dose cohorts (erdafitinib 2, 4, or 6 mg) with a daily dosing schedule of 21-day cycles or a 7 days-on/7 days-off intermittent schedule (erdafitinib 10 mg or 12 mg) of 28-day cycles. Results Nineteen patients received escalating doses of erdafitinib with a daily or intermittent schedule. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (73.7%), nausea (36.8%), stomatitis (26.3%), dysgeusia (26.3%) and dry mouth (21.1%). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this study. No Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, or serious TEAEs were noted and no clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory parameters, and electrocardiogram readings were observed. However, one case of dose-limiting toxicity in the 12 mg intermittent dosing group was observed: Grade 2 detachment of retinal pigment epithelium (bilateral) with treatment discontinuation. The maximum plasma concentrations of erdafitinib exhibited a dose-dependent increase. The median t<sub>max</sub> ranged from 2 to 3 h after the initial dose to 2-6 h following multiple daily dosing. Based on the safety and PK data, the 10 mg 7 days-on/7 days-off regimen was determined as the recommended phase 2 dose in this study.

Local invasion and metastasis formation are events associated with poor prognosis for which today there are no effective therapeutic options. Invasion and metastasis are strongly modulated by cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME), in particular fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Unraveling interactions between tumor cells and cells of the TME may identify novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets to prevent or treat metastasis. We report here the development and <i>in vivo</i> validation of a 3D tumor spheroid model to study the interactions between CRC cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. Co-cultured fibroblasts promoted SW620 and HCT116 CRC spheroid invasion, and this was prevented by the SRC and FGFR kinase inhibitors Dasatinib and Erdafitinib, respectively. To validate these findings <i>in vivo</i>, we injected SW620 cells alone or together with fibroblasts orthotopically in the caecum of mice. Co-injection with fibroblasts promoted lung metastasis growth, which was fully reversed by treatment with Dasatinib or Erdafitinib. Co-culture of SW620 or HCT116 CRC spheroids with endothelial cells suppressed spheroid growth while it had no effect on cancer cell migration or invasion. Consistent with this <i>in vitro</i> effect, co-injected endothelial cells significantly inhibited primary tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. From these experiments we conclude that effects on cancer cell invasion and growth induced by co-cultured TME cells and drug treatment in the 3D spheroid model <i>in vitro</i>, are predictive of <i>in vivo</i> effects. The 3D spheroid model may be considered as an attractive model to study the effect of heterotypic cellular interactions and drug activities on cancer cells, as animal testing alternative.

Sensitivity to FGFR inhibition and correlation with FGFR pathway activation status were determined in molecularly annotated panels of cancer cell lines and xenograft models. Pathway inhibition in response to FGFR inhibitor treatment was assessed in cell lines (both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>) and in samples from patients treated with the FGFR inhibitor JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib).

In this open-label, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients who had locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with prespecified <i>FGFR</i> alterations. All the patients had a history of disease progression during or after at least one course of chemotherapy or within 12 months after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31770593": "The human fibroblast growth factor family consists of 22 factors and five transmembrane receptors. Of the 22 factors, eighteen are secreted while four of them function exclusively within the cell. Four of the fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) possess intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase activity while the fifth (FGFRL1) has a short 105-residue intracellular non-enzymatic component. The FGFR protein kinase domain consists of a bi-lobed structure that is similar to that of all other protein kinases. FGFR gene alterations occur in a wide variety of cancers including those of the urinary bladder, breast, ovary, prostate, endometrium, lung, and stomach. The majority (66 %) of FGFR gene alterations involve gene amplifications, followed by mutations (26 %), and rearrangements that produce fusion proteins (8 %). Erdafitinib was the first orally effective FGFR antagonist approved by the FDA (2019) for the treatment of advanced cancer, that of the urinary bladder. FGF23 suppresses phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney; FGF23 blockade allows phosphate reabsorption to occur and leads to elevated serum phosphate levels. Erdafitinib and several other, but not all, FGFR antagonists produce hyperphosphatemia. Erdafitinib binds to an inactive DGF-D<sub>in</sub> conformation of FGFR1 and is classified as a type I\u00bd inhibitor. Similarly, dovitinib, AZD4547, CH5183284, infigratinib, lenvatinib, LY2874455, and lucitanib are type I\u00bd inhibitors. The inactive conformations contain an autoinhibitory brake that is made up of three main residues: an asparagine (N) within the \u03b1C-\u03b24 back loop, a glutamate (E) corresponding to the second hinge residue, and a lysine (K) in the \u03b28-strand (the NEK triad). PDGFR\u03b1/\u03b2, Kit, CSF1R, VEGFR1/2/3, Flt3, Tek, and Tie protein kinases are also regulated by a similar autoinhibitory brake mechanism. Ponatinib binds to FGFR4 in a DFG-D<sub>out</sub> conformation and is classified as a type II inhibitor. Futibatinib, roblitinib, H3B-6527, fisogatinib, and PRN1371 bind covalently to their FGFR target and are classified as type VI inhibitors. Nintedanib, pazopanib, pemigatinib, rogaratinib, fisogatinib, and PRN1371 are FGFR inhibitors lacking drug-enzyme crystal structures. All of the aforementioned FGFR antagonists are orally effective. The development of FGFR inhibitors has lagged behind those of other receptor protein-tyrosine kinases.

Androgens reduce and estrogens increase both spontaneous and immunization-induced antibodies to single-stranded DNA in NZB X NZW, NZB X C3H, NZB X CBA, NZB X DBA mice. Treatment of female NZB/W mice with testosterone or 5 alpha dihydrotestosterone retards the progress of autoimmunity. Castration is not necessary for this effect. In contrast, danazol has no favorable effect on the disease process. Estrogens cause a marked acceleration of autoimmunity and a reduction in thymus weight. During the course of these studies, we found that a number of problems or variables arise in studying sex hormone effects, including: 1) X-linked genes, 2) metabolism of testosterone to estrogens, 3) dose of hormone, 4) age at which administration is initiated, 5) differential effects of sex hormones on different autoantibodies and various immune responses.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1958563": "The immune response of males and females is not identical but instead has been shown to be dimorphic in its nature, with females generally demonstrating a greater overall response than males. This dimorphism extends to both the humoral and cell mediated systems and appears to be mechanistically based on the differences in type and concentration of sex steroids in males vs females. Furthermore, growth hormone and prolactin secretions which are different in males and females may also be partly responsible for the observed dimorphism. Because autoimmune disease results from a pathological perturbation of normal immune function, it follows that expression of these diseases will also demonstrate a dimorphic pattern. Examples of this autoimmune dimorphism include (but are not limited to) lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis with the two former more prevalent in females than males and the latter more severe during pregnancy. To explain autoimmune dimorphism it therefore becomes necessary firstly to describe the cellular and hormonal interactions found in normal immune regulation and thereafter extrapolate these to autoimmune phenomena.",

The mechanism of hormonal action in autoimmunity is unknown. Drawing on genetic studies of autoimmune disease, this article discusses how both genes and sex hormones may exert their effects through the same general mechanism, dysregulation of transcription factor NF-kappaB, an immunoregulatory protein. Gene and hormone alterations of the NF-kappaB signaling cascade provide a unifying hypothesis to explain the wide-ranging human and murine autoimmune disease phenotypes regulated by NF-kappaB, including cytokine balance, antigen presentation, lymphoid development, and lymphoid repertoire selection by apoptosis.",

While sex hormones have long been recognized for their roles in reproductive functions, within the past 2 decades scientists have found that sex hormones are integral signaling modulators of the mammalian immune system. Sex hormones have definitive roles in lymphocyte maturation, activation, and synthesis of antibodies and cytokines. Sex hormone expression is altered among patients with autoimmune disease, and this variation of expression contributes to immune dysregulation. English-language literature from the last 10 years was reviewed to examine the relationship between sex hormones and the function of the mammalian immune system. Approximately 50 publications were included in this review, and the majority were controlled trials with investigator blinding that compared both male and female diseased and normal subjects. The review provided basic knowledge regarding the broad impact of sex hormones on the immune system and how abnormal sex hormone expression contributes to the development and maintenance of autoimmune phenomena, with a focus on systemic lupus erythematosus, as models of \"lupus-prone\" mice are readily available. Sex hormones affect the function of the mammalian immune system, and sex hormone expression is different in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus than in healthy subjects. Sex hormones play a role in the genesis of autoimmunity. Future research may provide a therapeutic approach that is capable of altering disease pathogenesis, rather than targeting disease sequelae.",

The cause and mechanisms of this sex bias remains unknown despite multiple proposed hypotheses. Indeed, it is well established in several experimental settings that the human immune system exhibits sexual dimorphism with basic immune responses differing between females and males. Among candidate factors to explain these differences we note that particular attention has been primarily devoted to sex hormones, yet data have been inconclusive or have not been confirmed. The same seems to apply to the hypothesis of fetal microchimerism. Most recently, sex chromosome abnormalities and skewed X chromosome inactivation have been suggested as novel players, particularly in later-onset diseases. We review herein the most recent data on the mechanisms proposed for the female predominance. We also attempt to determine whether observed sex ratios are in fact the result of sex-biased awareness in case-finding studies.",

One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.",

However, the existing evidence to date has not provided any conclusive mechanism of gender-bias beyond the role of hormones and sex chromosomes. The gut microbiome, which impacts the innate and adaptive branches of immunity, not only influences the development of autoimmune disorders but may interact with sex-hormones to modulate disease progression and sex-bias.

This often occurs in response to injury or inflammation, leading to joint immobilization and significant disability. There are currently no definitive treatment options for this devastating disease. Although the most dramatic phenotype in FOP is the episodic and progressive heterotopic ossification, patients report a number of symptoms that affect other organ systems. Post-mortem examination of FOP patients may contribute to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and complications of this disease. Here, we present the autopsy findings from three patients with FOP. Autopsy findings in two of the three patients confirmed that the cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure in the setting of severe thoracic insufficiency from heterotopic ossification. Both of these patients also had evidence of right ventricular dilatation likely secondary to thoracic insufficiency. The third patient died from complications of a traumatic head injury after a fall but also had post-mortem evidence of thoracic insufficiency syndrome. All three patients had extensive, widespread heterotopic ossification and joint deformities consistent with FOP. There was extensive ossification of the spinal ligament in these patients, which may contribute to cervical spine rigidity. One patient was diagnosed post-mortem with a brainstem malformation. No additional significant abnormalities were noted in the other organ systems. Finally, we also demonstrate that cadaveric skin fibroblasts can be isolated for use as a potential source for future in vitro cell culture studies. This autopsy case series provides valuable information about the underlying complications of FOP and contributes significantly to our knowledge of this rare yet debilitating disorder. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome, right heart dysfunction, widespread heterotopic ossification, spinal ligament ossification, and CNS malformations were clearly evident; however, most other non-bone tissues appeared to be spared from gross malformations. Finally, the ability to isolate live cells from cadaveric skin is an important technique that will facilitate future studies, particularly as induced pluripotent stem cells and other cell-based technologies evolve. This case series highlights the importance of post-mortem examinations and their contribution to our current knowledge of disease pathophysiology and comorbidities.",

To better ascertain the frequency and characteristics of osteocartilaginous exostoses in FOP disease, we conducted a cross-sectional radiological study based on all the traceable cases identified in a previous comprehensive national research. Metaphyseal exostoses were present in all the 17 cases of FOP studied. Although most often arising from the distal femoral (where metaphyseal exostoses adopt a peculiar not yet reported appearance) and proximal tibial bones, we have found that they are not restricted to these areas, but rather can be seen scattered at a variety of other skeletal sites. Using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, we show that these exophytic outgrowths are true osteochondromas. As a whole, these results are in agreement with data coming from the literature review. Our study confirms the presence of metaphyseal osteochondromas as a very frequent trait of FOP phenotype and an outstanding feature of its anomalous skeletal developmental component. In line with recent evidences, this might imply that dysregulation of BMP signaling, in addition to promoting exuberant heterotopic ossification, could induce aberrant chondrogenesis and osteochondroma formation. Unveiling the molecular links between these physiopathological pathways could help to illuminate the mechanisms that govern bone morphogenesis.",

In this disease, HO can occur in discrete flares, often triggered by injury or inflammation, or may progress incrementally without identified triggers. Mice harboring an Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup> knock-in allele recapitulate the phenotypic spectrum of FOP, including injury-responsive intramuscular HO and spontaneous articular, tendon, and ligament ossification. The cells that drive HO in these diverse tissues can be compartmentalized into two lineages: an Scx<sup>+</sup> tendon-derived progenitor that mediates endochondral HO of ligaments and joints without exogenous injury, and a muscle-resident interstitial Mx1<sup>+</sup> population that mediates intramuscular, injury-dependent endochondral HO. Expression of Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup> in either lineage confers aberrant gain of BMP signaling and chondrogenic differentiation in response to activin A and gives rise to mutation-expressing hypertrophic chondrocytes in HO lesions. Compared to Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup>, expression of the man-made, ligand-independent ACVR1<sup>Q207D</sup> mutation accelerates and increases the penetrance of all observed phenotypes, but does not abrogate the need for antecedent injury in muscle HO, demonstrating the need for an injury factor in addition to enhanced BMP signaling. Both injury-dependent intramuscular and spontaneous ligament HO in Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup> knock-in mice were effectively controlled by the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN-212854. Thus, diverse phenotypes of HO found in FOP are rooted in cell-autonomous effects of dysregulated ACVR1 signaling in nonoverlapping tissue-resident progenitor pools that may be addressed by systemic therapy or by modulating injury-mediated factors involved in their local recruitment.",

Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have focused on CpG islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (&gt;100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue.

In this work, we discuss clinical and molecular findings on a group of patients in whom a SLC40A1 single copy missense variant was identified. Three novel variants, p.D181N, p.G204R and p.R296Q were functionally characterized. Fpn D181N and R296Q mutants can be classified as full or partial loss of function, respectively. Replacement of G204 with arginine appears to cause a more complex defect with impact both on iron export function and hepcidin sensitivity.

In the present study, we tried to investigate the frequency and pathogenicity of the SLC40A1 p.Y333H mutation in haemochromatosis in China. Patients were analysed for SLC40A1 p.Y333H as well as mutations in the other classic haemochromatosis-related genes by Sanger sequencing. To analyse iron export capacity of the SLC40A1 p.Y333H mutant, the 293T cells were transfected with the SLC40A1 p.Y333H construct and then treated with hepcidin after exposure to ferric ammonium citrate. Cellular localization of mutant FPN1, expression of FPN1 and intracellular ferritin were analysed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Of 22 unrelated cases with primary iron overload, three cases (3/22, 13.6%) harboured the SLC40A1 p.Y333H, with no missense mutations identified in any other classical haemochromatosis-related genes including HFE, HJV, HAMP and TFR2. Pedigree analysis showed that three probands and the son of one proband had haemochromatosis of stage 3, while the son of another proband with age of 16 showed elevated transferrin saturation but normal serum ferritin level. In vitro studies showed the mutant p.Y333H ferroportin was resistant to hepcidin, affecting the subsequent internalization and degradation of FPN1, and was associated with ferroportin gain of function. The SLC40A1 p.Y333H mutation is associated with gain of function of ferroportin, representing one of the major aetiological factors of haemochromatosis in China.",

SLC40A1 mutations fall into two functional categories (loss- versus gain-of-function) underlying two distinct clinical entities (hemochromatosis type 4A versus type 4B). However, the vast majority of SLC40A1 mutations are rare missense variations, with only a few showing strong evidence of causality. The present study reports the results of an integrated approach collecting genetic and phenotypic data from 44 suspected hemochromatosis type 4 patients, with comprehensive structural and functional annotations. Causality was demonstrated for 10 missense variants, showing a clear dichotomy between the two hemochromatosis type 4 subtypes. Two subgroups of loss-of-function mutations were distinguished: one impairing cell-surface expression and one altering only iron egress. Additionally, a new gain-of-function mutation was identified, and the degradation of ferroportin on hepcidin binding was shown to probably depend on the integrity of a large extracellular loop outside of the hepcidin-binding domain. Eight further missense variations, on the other hand, were shown to have no discernible effects at either protein or RNA level; these were found in apparently isolated patients and were associated with a less severe phenotype. The present findings illustrate the importance of combining in silico and biochemical approaches to fully distinguish pathogenic SLC40A1 mutations from benign variants.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20039160": "Genetic hemochromatosis is classified into four subtypes of which only type 1 is of clinical importance in Caucasians. Type 1 is due to an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism; the homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene on chromosome 6 accounts for more than 90% of the clinical phenotype in populations of Celtic origin. The mutation leads to an inadequately high intestinal iron absorption which may finally cause iron overload in and damage to various organs. Type 2 is the juvenile form of iron overload which leads to a severe phenotype prior to age 30 with cardiomyopathy and hypogonadism. The corresponding mutations are located in the hemojuveline and hepcidin genes. Typ 3 has mainly been described in Italian families and refers to mutations in transferrin receptor 2 gene. Histopathologic and clinical consequences of type 3 hemochromatosis are similar to those seen in type 1. Types 2 and 3 are autosomal recessive traits. Type 4 hemochromatosis follows an autosomal dominant trait; the corresponding mutation affects the basolateral iron carrier ferroportin 1. Diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on determinations of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation with the latter being more sensitive and specific. In case of a homozygous C282Y gene test, liver biopsy is not required for diagnosis. Liver biopsy is, however, recommended in C282Y homozygotes at ferritin values &gt; 1,000 ng/ml because of an increased risk for liver fibrosis. Phlebotomy treatment is the standard care to remove iron in genetic hemochromatosis. Patients treated in the early noncirrhotic stage have a normal life expectancy. Thus, future efforts should aim at early diagnosis. Iron removal also improves the outcome in cirrhotic patients. Liver carcinoma may develop in cirrhotic patients despite iron depletion. Liver cancers without cirrhosis are so rare that screening is only recommended in cirrhotic patients.",

Gene expression data were employed to infer potential targets of compounds and create a generic pathway map. Binary linear programming (BLP) was then developed to optimize the generic pathway topology based on the mid-stage signaling response of phosphorylation. To demonstrate effectiveness of this approach, we built a generic pathway map for the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and inferred the cell-specific pathways by BLP. The first group of 11 compounds was utilized to optimize the generic pathways, and then 4 compounds were used to identify effects based on the inferred cell-specific pathways. Cross-validation indicated that the cell-specific pathways reliably predicted a compound's effects. Finally, we applied BLP to re-optimize the cell-specific pathways to predict the effects of 4 compounds (trichostatin A, MS-275, staurosporine, and digoxigenin) according to compound-induced topological alterations. Trichostatin A and MS-275 (both HDAC inhibitors) inhibited the downstream pathway of HDAC1 and caused cell growth arrest via activation of p53 and p21; the effects of digoxigenin were totally opposite. Staurosporine blocked the cell cycle via p53 and p21, but also promoted cell growth via activated HDAC1 and its downstream pathway.

We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs.

Furthermore, a negative correlation between mediators and IOP was seen in the PSS group, potentially caused by acetazolamide-treatment. Our findings show that immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation and influence IOP levels. Remarkable similarities but also significant differences of immune mediator concentrations are apparent in PSS compared to FU. High concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 correlate with active inflammation in PSS, while FU may trigger chronic inflammation. Our data also substantiated a very similar composition of cytokines in those patients from the PSS group suffering from ocular hypertension and thus offers a potential explanation model for a negative correlation between mediators and IOP.",

The clinical manifestation of the triad of heterochromia, cataract and glaucoma varies considerably. This explains the often delayed diagnosis. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis of the changes are still unclear, there is no doubt that infections play a significant role. Intraocular antibodies directed against rubella viruses show a high association with the disease pattern, and their detection can even be used to support the diagnosis. The treatment of FU is limited to symptomatic measures. Corticosteroids are usually only moderately effective and should be used with caution due to adverse effects, with progression of cataract and secondary glaucoma. The prognosis of the disease can be regarded as favourable and depends essentially on the secondary changes.",

It is underdiagnosed because of its variable clinical spectrum. Although it can mimic various forms of anterior uveitis, it is important to make the correct diagnosis, based on clinical grounds, because both the management and prognosis differ from those of other uveitides. While its etiology remains unknown, it is possible that the disease has multiple causes that lead through different pathogenic mechanisms to the same clinical entity. Although many patients do not require treatment, it is not a benign condition, as often perceived. The high incidence of glaucoma makes it mandatory that all patients with FUS should be screened at regular intervals, even if they are not being actively treated and are relatively asymptomatic.",

Immunohistochemical staining using 406 NSCLC and 265 ESCC specimens confirmed that LY6K overexpression was associated with poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC (P = 0.0003), as well as ESCC (P = 0.0278), and multivariate analysis confirmed its independent prognostic value for NSCLC (P = 0.0035). We established an ELISA to measure serum LY6K and found that the proportion of the serum LY6K-positive cases was 38 of 112 (33.9%) NSCLC and 26 of 81 (32.1%) ESCC, whereas only 3 of 74 (4.1%) healthy volunteers were falsely diagnosed. In most cases, there was no correlation between serum LY6K and conventional tumor markers of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19-fragment (CYFRA 21-1) values. A combined ELISA for both LY6K and CEA classified 64.7% of lung adenocarcinoma patients as positive, and the use of both LY6K and CYFRA 21-1 increased sensitivity in the detection of lung squamous cell carcinomas and ESCCs up to 70.4% and 52.5%, respectively, whereas the false positive rate was 6.8% to 9.5%. In addition, knocked down of LY6K expression with small interfering RNAs resulted in growth suppression of the lung and esophageal cancer cells. Our data imply that a cancer-testis antigen, LY6K, should be useful as a new type of tumor biomarker and probably as a target for the development of new molecular therapies for cancer treatment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26814189": "A substantial fraction of phenotypic differences between closely related species are likely caused by differences in gene regulation. While this has already been postulated over 30 years ago, only few examples of evolutionary changes in gene regulation have been verified. Here, we identified and investigated binding sites of the transcription factor GA-binding protein alpha (GABPa) aiming to discover cis-regulatory adaptations on the human lineage. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments in a human cell line, we found 11,619 putative GABPa binding sites. Through sequence comparisons of the human GABPa binding regions with orthologous sequences from 34 mammals, we identified substitutions that have resulted in 224 putative human-specific GABPa binding sites. To experimentally assess the transcriptional impact of those substitutions, we selected four promoters for promoter-reporter gene assays using human and African green monkey cells. We compared the activities of wild-type promoters to mutated forms, where we have introduced one or more substitutions to mimic the ancestral state devoid of the GABPa consensus binding sequence. Similarly, we introduced the human-specific substitutions into chimpanzee and macaque promoter backgrounds. Our results demonstrate that the identified substitutions are functional, both in human and nonhuman promoters. In addition, we performed GABPa knock-down experiments and found 1,215 genes as strong candidates for primary targets. Further analyses of our data sets link GABPa to cognitive disorders, diabetes, KRAB zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF), and human-specific genes. Thus, we propose that differences in GABPa binding sites played important roles in the evolution of human-specific phenotypes.",

Although the distinct biological functions of most KRAB-ZNF proteins remain unknown, recent publications indicate their implication in fundamental processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, development, and tumorigenesis. SZF1/ZNF589 was first identified as a gene with SZF1-1 isoform specifically expressed in CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, strongly suggesting a role in epigenetic control of gene expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the function of SZF1/ZNF589 in hematopoiesis has not yet been elucidated. Our study reveals SZF1/ZNF589 as a gene with a human-specific nucleotide DNA-change, conferring potential species-specific functional properties. Through shRNA-mediated loss-of-function experiments, we found that changes in expression of fundamental apoptosis-controlling genes are induced on SZF1/ZNF589 knockdown, resulting in inhibited growth of hematopoietic cell lines and decreased progenitor potential of primary human bone marrow CD34(+) cells. Moreover, we found that the SZF1/ZNF589 gene is differentially regulated during hypoxia in CD34(+) HSPCs in a cytokine-dependent manner, implicating its possible involvement in the maintenance of the hypoxic physiologic status of hematopoietic stem cells. Our results establish the role of SZF1/ZNF589 as a new functional regulator of the hematopoietic system.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17542650": "We performed a genome-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip comparison of two modifications (trimethylation of lysine 9 [H3me3K9] and trimethylation of lysine 27 [H3me3K27]) of histone H3 in Ntera2 testicular carcinoma cells and in three different anatomical sources of primary human fibroblasts. We found that in each of the cell types the two modifications were differentially enriched at the promoters of the two largest classes of transcription factors. Specifically, zinc finger (ZNF) genes were bound by H3me3K9 and homeobox genes were bound by H3me3K27. We have previously shown that the Polycomb repressive complex 2 is responsible for mediating trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 in human cancer cells. In contrast, there is little overlap between H3me3K9 targets and components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, suggesting that a different histone methyltransferase is responsible for the H3me3K9 modification. Previous studies have shown that SETDB1 can trimethylate H3 on lysine 9, using in vitro or artificial tethering assays. SETDB1 is thought to be recruited to chromatin by complexes containing the KAP1 corepressor. To determine if a KAP1-containing complex mediates trimethylation of the identified H3me3K9 targets, we performed ChIP-chip assays and identified KAP1 target genes using human 5-kb promoter arrays. We found that a large number of genes of ZNF transcription factors were bound by both KAP1 and H3me3K9 in normal and cancer cells. To expand our studies of KAP1, we next performed a complete genomic analysis of KAP1 binding using a 38-array tiling set, identifying ~7,000 KAP1 binding sites. The identified KAP1 targets were highly enriched for C2H2 ZNFs, especially those containing Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) domains. Interestingly, although most KAP1 binding sites were within core promoter regions, the binding sites near ZNF genes were greatly enriched within transcribed regions of the target genes. Because KAP1 is recruited to the DNA via interaction with KRAB-ZNF proteins, we suggest that expression of KRAB-ZNF genes may be controlled via an auto-regulatory mechanism involving KAP1.",

We describe the regulatory and clinical issues important to the FDA's approval of this New Drug Application, with special focus on the risk-benefit balance. We also describe a new labeling feature that presents additional efficacy data to clinicians. Data sets for all relevant clinical trials of pimavanserin and the Applicant's and FDA's analyses of these data were considered in this review. Data were available from 616 patients with Parkinson's disease with hallucinations and delusions who received at least 1 dose of pimavanserin, with a total exposure of 825 patient-years in the Parkinson's disease psychosis population. Pimavanserin 34 mg/d was effective in treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease. In the Applicant's single pivotal trial, 80.5% of pimavanserin patients experienced at least some improvement in symptoms compared to 58.1% of patients taking placebo. Pimavanserin did not worsen motor function, an adverse effect commonly observed with other antipsychotics, probably because of a lack of consequential dopamine binding. Pimavanserin is the only FDA-approved treatment for the hallucinations and delusions seen in patients with psychosis of Parkinson's disease. Although pimavanserin appears to have a pharmacologic mechanism that is different from other atypical antipsychotics, concern remained that the increased risk of death seen with antipsychotic use in elderly demented patients, and described in all approved antipsychotic labels, would also occur with pimavanserin. Pimavanserin bears the same boxed warning about the risk of death associated with antipsychotic use in elderly patients with dementia.",

How the timing and execution of cytokinesis is controlled is poorly understood. Here, we show that downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity, together with upregulation of its counteracting phosphatase Cdc14, controls each of the sequential steps of cytokinesis, including furrow ingression, membrane resolution and cell separation in budding yeast. We use phosphoproteome analysis of mitotic exit to identify Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated at the time of cytokinesis. We then apply a new and widely applicable tool to generate conditionally phosphorylated proteins to identify those whose dephosphorylation is required for cytokinesis. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators. Our results suggest that cytokinesis is coordinately controlled by the master cell cycle regulator Cdk together with its counteracting phosphatase and that it is executed by concerted dephosphorylation of Cdk targets involved in several cell biological processes.",

Management of these conditions therefore relies on controlling serum uric acid levels. ATP-binding cassette transporter, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2/BCRP) is a well-studied urate transporter expressed on apical membranes in several tissues, including the intestine, liver, and kidney. Here, we discuss the potential of future gout therapies targeting ABCG2. Areas covered: ABCG2 regulates serum uric acid via physiologically important roles in both renal and extra-renal urate excretion. ABCG2 dysfunction, which promotes onset of hyperuricemia, often results in decreased urate excretion through the extra-renal (principally intestinal), rather than the renal pathway. This review covers recent attempts to establish the basis of ABCG2 function according to genetic diathesis, its molecular structure, and the effects of medication. Furthermore, the possibility of treating gout and hyperuricemia by upregulating intestinal ABCG2 expression is examined. Expert opinion: ABCG2 holds great promise as a therapeutic target for these conditions, particularly considering its involvement in extra-renal urate excretion. Manipulation of ABCG2, including controlling the level and location of its expression, has the potential to prevent gout by promoting uric acid excretion as effectively as general uricosuric drugs.

A transcription template, pT207-18, was constructed containing tandemly repeated 207 base-pair (bp) nucleosome positioning sequences from a sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus) 5 S RNA gene inserted between the T7 and SP6 transcription promoters of pGEM-3Z. Nucleosome cores were reconstituted onto supercoiled, closed circular pT207-18 DNA and double label transcription experiments were performed to determine the effects of nucleosome cores on the initiation and elongation of transcripts by T7 RNA polymerase. Both transcript initiation and elongation were inhibited, the extent of the inhibition being directly proportional to the number of nucleosome cores reconstituted onto the pT207-18 DNA templates. Time course transcription experiments indicated that nucleosome cores caused a reduction in the equilibrium length of transcripts and not mere retardation of elongation rates. Continuous regularly spaced linear arrays of nucleosomes were obtained by digesting reconstituted nucleosomel pT207-18 templates with DraI, for which a unique restriction site lies within the nucleosome positioning region of the 207 bp 5 S rDNA repeat sequence. After in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase an RNA ladder with 207 nucleotide spacing was obtained, indicating that transcription can occur through continuous arrays of positioned nucleosome cores. It is demonstrated that nucleosome cores partially inhibit the elongation of transcripts by T7 RNA polymerase, while allowing passage of the transcribing polymerase through each nucleosome core at an upper limit efficiency of 85%. Hence, complete transcripts are produced with high efficiency from short nucleosomal templates, while the production of full-length transcripts from long nucleosomal arrays is relatively inefficient. The results indicate that nucleosome cores have significant inhibitory effects in vitro not only on transcription initiation but on transcription elongation as well, and that special mechanisms may exist to overcome these inhibitory effects in vivo.",

Double label transcription experiments showed that there was little or no effect of extensive crosslinking of the histone octamers on transcription initiation and elongation by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro.

Under ionic strength approaching physiological conditions we have observed that transcription causes nucleosome dissociation and histone redistribution within the template. We have examined the role of the different elements that, in principle, could induce nucleosome dissociation during transcription. The high affinity of histones for single-stranded DNA observed in titration experiments performed using the purified (+) and (-) strands of the NX1 fragment suggests that nucleosome dissociation is not due to the formation of segments of single-stranded DNA by RNA polymerase in the elongation process. Furthermore, our results show that although RNA can interact with core histones, the synthesized RNA is not bound to the histones dissociated by transcription. Our results indicate that core histones released during transcription can be bound to naked DNA and chromatin (with or without histones H1-H5). From the dynamic properties of excess histones bound to chromatin, we suggest a nucleosome transcription mechanism in which displaced histones are transiently bound to chromatin and finally are reassembled with DNA after the passage of the polymerase.",

Regularly spaced arrays of nucleosome cores were assembled onto this DNA template from donor histone octamers by salt step dialysis. Histone H1 was incorporated onto free DNA or reconstituted chromatin templates and double label transcription assays were performed. The experiments indicated that histone H1 has a strong inhibitory effect on both transcription initiation and elongation. These effects are especially pronounced on chromatin templates, where both transcription initiation and elongation are virtually halted. The inhibition of transcription elongation appears to result from a dramatic increase in premature termination of transcripts.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12596908": "In eukaryotic cells, transcription and replication each occur on DNA templates that are incorporated into nucleosomes. Formation of chromatin generally limits accessibility of specific DNA sequences and inhibits progression of polymerases as they copy information from the DNA. The processes that select sites for initiating either transcription or replication are therefore strongly influenced by factors that modulate the properties of chromatin proteins. Further, in order to elongate their products, both DNA and RNA polymerases must be able to overcome the inhibition presented by chromatin (Lipford and Bell 2001; Workman and Kingston 1998). One way to adjust the properties of chromatin proteins is to covalently modify them by adding or removing chemical moieties. Both histone and non-histone chromatin proteins are altered by acetylation, methylation, and other changes, and the 'nucleosome modifying' complexes that perform these reactions are important components of pathways of transcriptional regulation (Cote 2002; Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Roth et al. 2001; Strahl and Allis 2000; Workman and Kingston 1998). Another way to alter the effects of nucleosomes is to change the position of the histone octamers relative to specific DNA sequences (Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Verrijzer 2002; Wang 2002; Workman and Kingston 1998). Since the ability of a sequence to be bound by specific proteins can vary significantly whether the sequence is in the linkers between nucleosomes or at various positions within a nucleosome, 'nucleosome remodeling' complexes that rearrange nucleosome positioning are also important regulators of transcription. Since the DNA replication machinery has to encounter many of the same challenges posed by chromatin, it seems likely that modifying and remodeling complexes also act during duplication of the genome, but most of the current information on these factors relates to regulation of transcription. This chapter describes the factor known variously as FACT in humans, where it promotes elongation of RNA polymerase II on nucleosomal templates in vitro (Orphanides et al. 1998, 1999), DUF in frogs, where it is needed for DNA replication in oocyte extracts (Okuhara et al. 1999), and CP or SPN in yeast, where it is linked in vivo to both transcription and replication (Brewster et al. 2001; Formosa et al. 2001). Like the nucleosome modifying and remodeling complexes, it is broadly conserved among eukaryotes, affects a wide range of processes that utilize chromatin, and directly alters the properties of nucleosomes. However, it does not have nucleosome modifying or standard ATP-dependent remodeling activity, and therefore represents a third class of chromatin modulating factors. It is also presently unique in the extensive connections it displays with both transcription and replication: FACT/DUF/CP/SPN appears to modify nucleosomes in a way that is directly important for the efficient functioning of both RNA polymerases and DNA polymerases. While less is known about the mechanisms it uses to promote its functions than for other factors that affect chromatin, it is clearly an essential part of the complex mixture of activities that modulate access to DNA within chromatin. Physical and genetic interactions suggest that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN affects multiple pathways within replication and transcription as a member of several distinct complexes. Some of the interactions are easy to assimilate into models for replication or transcription, such as direct binding to DNA polymerase alpha (Wittmeyer and Formosa 1997; Wittmeyer et al. 1999), association with nucleosome modifying complexes (John et al. 2000), and interaction with factors that participate in elongation of RNA Polymerase II (Gavin et al. 2002; Squazzo et al. 2002). Others are more surprising such as an association with the 19S complex that regulates the function of the 20S proteasome (Ferdous et al. 2001; Xu et al. 1995), and the indication that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN can act as a specificity factor for casein kinase II (Keller et al. 2001). This chapter reviews the varied approaches that have each revealed different aspects of the function of FACT/DUF/CP/SPN, and presents a picture of a factor that can both alter nucleosomes and orchestrate the assembly or activity of a broad range of complexes that act upon chromatin.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22885008": "Although the genomic pattern of nucleosome positioning is broadly conserved, quantitative aspects vary over evolutionary timescales. We identify the cis and trans determinants of nucleosome positioning using a functional evolutionary approach involving S. cerevisiae strains containing large genomic regions from other yeast species. In a foreign species, nucleosome depletion at promoters is maintained over poly(dA:dT) tracts, whereas internucleosome spacing and all other aspects of nucleosome positioning tested are not. Interestingly, the locations of the +1 nucleosome and RNA start sites shift in concert. Strikingly, in a foreign species, nucleosome-depleted regions occur fortuitously in coding regions, and they often act as promoters that are associated with a positioned nucleosome array linked to the length of the transcription unit. We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29212533": " TFIIS stimulates RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II and promotes the resolution of backtracking events. TFIIS acts in the chromatin context, but its contribution to the chromatin landscape has not yet been investigated. Co-transcriptional chromatin alterations include subtle changes in nucleosome positioning, like those expected to be elicited by TFIIS, which are elusive to detect. The most popular method to map nucleosomes involves intensive chromatin digestion by micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Maps based on these exhaustively digested samples miss any MNase-sensitive nucleosomes caused by transcription. In contrast, partial digestion approaches preserve such nucleosomes, but introduce noise due to MNase sequence preferences. A systematic way of correcting this bias for massively parallel sequencing experiments is still missing. To investigate the contribution of TFIIS to the chromatin landscape, we developed a refined nucleosome-mapping method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on partial MNase digestion and a sequence-bias correction derived from naked DNA cleavage, the refined method efficiently mapped nucleosomes in promoter regions rich in MNase-sensitive structures. The naked DNA correction was also important for mapping gene body nucleosomes, particularly in those genes whose core promoters contain a canonical TATA element. With this improved method, we analyzed the global nucleosomal changes caused by lack of TFIIS. We detected a general increase in nucleosomal fuzziness and more restricted changes in nucleosome occupancy, which concentrated in some gene categories. The TATA-containing genes were preferentially associated with decreased occupancy in gene bodies, whereas the TATA-like genes did so with increased fuzziness. The detected chromatin alterations correlated with functional defects in nascent transcription, as revealed by genomic run-on experiments. The combination of partial MNase digestion and naked DNA correction of the sequence bias is a precise nucleosomal mapping method that does not exclude MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. This method is useful for detecting subtle alterations in nucleosome positioning produced by lack of TFIIS. Their analysis revealed that TFIIS generally contributed to nucleosome positioning in both gene promoters and bodies. The independent effect of lack of TFIIS on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation.",

One potential source is remnants of protein-coding genes that transitioned into lncRNAs. We systematically compare lncRNA and protein-coding loci across vertebrates, and estimate that up to 5% of conserved mammalian lncRNAs are derived from lost protein-coding genes. These lncRNAs have specific characteristics, such as broader expression domains, that set them apart from other lncRNAs. Fourteen lncRNAs have sequence similarity with the loci of the contemporary homologs of the lost protein-coding genes. We propose that selection acting on enhancer sequences is mostly responsible for retention of these regions. As an example of an RNA element from a protein-coding ancestor that was retained in the lncRNA, we describe in detail a short translated ORF in the JPX lncRNA that was derived from an upstream ORF in a protein-coding gene and retains some of its functionality. We estimate that ~ 55 annotated conserved human lncRNAs are derived from parts of ancestral protein-coding genes, and loss of coding potential is thus a non-negligible source of new lncRNAs. Some lncRNAs inherited regulatory elements influencing transcription and translation from their protein-coding ancestors and those elements can influence the expression breadth and functionality of these lncRNAs.",

MVA with a virus titer of 1 x 108 TCID50/dose was administered via subcutaneous injection to 56-80 year old vaccinia-experienced subjects (N = 120). Subjects received either two injections of MVA (MM group) or one injection of Placebo and one injection of MVA (PM group) four weeks apart. Safety was evaluated by assessment of adverse events (AE), focused physical exams, electrocardiogram recordings and safety laboratories. Solicited AEs consisted of a set of pre-defined expected local reactions (erythema, swelling, pain, pruritus, and induration) and systemic symptoms (body temperature, headache, myalgia, nausea and fatigue) and were recorded on a memory aid for an 8-day period following each injection. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated in terms of humoral immune responses measured with a vaccinia-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) before and at different time points after vaccination. Vaccinations were well tolerated by all subjects. No serious adverse event related to MVA and no case of myopericarditis was reported. The overall incidence of unsolicited AEs was similar in both groups. For both groups immunogenicity responses two weeks after the final vaccination (i.e. Visit 4) were as follows: Seroconversion (SC) rates (doubling of titers from baseline) in vaccine specific antibody titers measured by ELISA were 83.3% in Group MM and 82.8% in Group PM (difference 0.6% with 95% exact CI [-13.8%, 15.0%]), and 90.0% for Group MM and 77.6% for Group PM measured by PRNT (difference 12.4% with 95% CI of [-1.1%, 27.0%]).

MVA was attenuated by extensive passage of vaccinia virus Ankara in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Several immunomodulatory genes and genes that influence host range are deleted or mutated, and replication is aborted in the late stage of infection in most nonavian cells. The effect of these mutations on immunogenicity is not well understood. Since the structural genes appear to be intact in MVA, it is hypothesized that critical targets for antibody neutralization have been retained. To test this, we probed microarrays of the Western Reserve (WR) proteome with sera from humans and macaques after MVA and Dryvax vaccination. As most protein sequences of MVA are 97 to 99% identical to those of other vaccinia virus strains, extensive binding cross-reactivity is expected, except for those deleted or truncated. Despite different hosts and immunization regimens, the MVA and Dryvax antibody profiles were broadly similar, with antibodies against membrane and core proteins being the best conserved. The responses to nonstructural proteins were less well conserved, although these are not expected to influence virus neutralization. The broadest antibody response was obtained for hyperimmune rabbits with WR, which is pathogenic in rabbits. These data indicate that, despite the mutations and deletions in MVA, its overall immunogenicity is broadly comparable to that of Dryvax, particularly at the level of antibodies to membrane proteins.

In light of recent data demonstrating that vaccinia viruses, including MVA, preferentially infect antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play crucial roles in generating antiviral immunity, we hypothesized that expression of specific cytokines and chemokines that mediate APC recruitment and activation from recombinant MVA (rMVA) vectors would enhance the immunogenicity of these vectors. To test this hypothesis, we generated rMVAs that express murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mGM-CSF), human CCL20/human macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha (hCCL20/hMIP-3alpha), or human fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (hFlt3-L), factors predicted to increase levels of dendritic cells (DCs), to recruit DCs to sites of immunization, or to promote maturation of DCs in vivo, respectively. These rMVAs also coexpress the well-characterized, immunodominant lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (NP) antigen that enabled sensitive and quantitative assessment of antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses following immunization of BALB/c mice. Our results demonstrate that immunization of mice with rMVAs expressing mGM-CSF or hCCL20, but not hFlt3-L, results in two- to fourfold increases of cellular immune responses directed against vector-encoded antigens and 6- to 17-fold enhancements of MVA-specific antibody titers, compared to those responses elicited by nonadjuvanted rMVA. Of note, cytokine augmentation of cellular immune responses occurs when rMVAs are given as primary immunizations but not when they are used as booster immunizations, suggesting that these APC-modulating proteins, when used as poxvirus-encoded adjuvants, are more effective at stimulating na\u00efve T-cell responses than in promoting recall of preexisting memory T-cell responses.

Nintedanib inhibited proliferation of PVSMCs and prevented thickening of the vessel walls and luminal occlusion of pulmonary arteries.

These effects were associated with a normalisation of the serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in Fra2 mice on treatment with nintedanib. Nintedanib also effectively blocked myofibroblast differentiation and reduced pulmonary, dermal and myocardial fibrosis in Fra2-transgenic mice. The antifibrotic effects of nintedanib were associated with impaired M2 polarisation of monocytes and reduced numbers of M2 macrophages.

Pirfenidone and nintedanib are emerging agents that exert pleiotropic effects, reflective of the multiple mechanistic pathways of IPF. Treatment may necessitate a similarly multifaceted approach using combination regimens of antifibrotic and antioxidant agents in order to be effective. In other ILDs, including systemic sclerosis, other connective tissue diseases and pulmonary sarcoidosis, the inflammatory/fibrotic model remains appropriate. Studies in systemic sclerosis have provided 'proof of concept' data for immunosuppressive therapy in the prevention of disease progression but there is a continuing need for controlled clinical trials in the more prevalent ILDs. In IPF, significant treatment effects have been reported with pirfenidone, nintedanib and N-acetylcysteine. Combinations of these pleiotropic agents, along with future monotherapies, in 'oncological regimens' may hold the key to more effective IPF treatment. In disorders other than IPF, there is an ongoing need for the controlled evaluation of traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies. 'Cohort enrichment' (the selective recruitment of patients most likely to progress) holds the key to the identification of worthwhile treatment benefits.",

Patients who had systemic sclerosis with an onset of the first non-Raynaud's symptom within the past 7 years and a high-resolution computed tomographic scan that showed fibrosis affecting at least 10% of the lungs were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive 150 mg of nintedanib, administered orally twice daily, or placebo. The primary end point was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), assessed over a 52-week period. Key secondary end points were absolute changes from baseline in the modified Rodnan skin score and in the total score on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at week 52. A total of 576 patients received at least one dose of nintedanib or placebo; 51.9% had diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and 48.4% were receiving mycophenolate at baseline. In the primary end-point analysis, the adjusted annual rate of change in FVC was -52.4 ml per year in the nintedanib group and -93.3 ml per year in the placebo group (difference, 41.0 ml per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9 to 79.0; P = 0.04). Sensitivity analyses based on multiple imputation for missing data yielded P values for the primary end point ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. The change from baseline in the modified Rodnan skin score and the total score on the SGRQ at week 52 did not differ significantly between the trial groups, with differences of -0.21 (95% CI, -0.94 to 0.53; P = 0.58) and 1.69 (95% CI, -0.73 to 4.12 [not adjusted for multiple comparisons]), respectively. Diarrhea, the most common adverse event, was reported in 75.7% of the patients in the nintedanib group and in 31.6% of those in the placebo group. Among patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis, the annual rate of decline in FVC was lower with nintedanib than with placebo; no clinical benefit of nintedanib was observed for other manifestations of systemic sclerosis. The adverse-event profile of nintedanib observed in this trial was similar to that observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; gastrointestinal adverse events, including diarrhea, were more common with nintedanib than with placebo.

Fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype show commonalities in clinical behaviour and in the pathogenic mechanisms that drive disease worsening. Nintedanib is an intracellular inhibitor of tyrosine kinases that has been approved for treatment of IPF and has recently been shown to reduce the rate of lung function decline in patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD). <i>In vitro</i> data demonstrate that nintedanib inhibits several steps in the initiation and progression of lung fibrosis, including the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators, migration and differentiation of fibrocytes and fibroblasts, and deposition of extracellular matrix. Nintedanib also inhibits the proliferation of vascular cells. Studies in animal models with features of fibrosing ILDs such as IPF, SSc-ILD, rheumatoid arthritis-ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and silicosis demonstrate that nintedanib has anti-fibrotic activity irrespective of the trigger for the lung pathology. This suggests that nintedanib inhibits fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of fibrosis.

Progressive and refractory pulmonary sarcoidoisis constitute more than 10% of patients seen at specialized centers. Pulmonary fibrosis and associated complications, such as infections and pulmonary hypertension are leading causes of mortality. No universal definition of refractoriness exists, we therefore propose classifying patients as having refractory disease when the following criteria are fulfilled: (1) progressive disease despite at least 10 mg of prednisolone or equivalent for at least three months and need for additional disease-modifying anti-sarcoid drugs due to lack of efficacy, drug toxicity or intolerability and (2) treatment started for significant impairment of life due to progressive pulmonary symptoms. Both criteria should be fulfilled. Treatment options in addition to or instead of glucocorticoids for these patients include second- (methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide) and third-line agents (infliximab, adalimumab). Other immunmodulating agents can be used, but the evidence is very limited. Newer agents with anti-fibrotic properties, such as pirfenidone or nintedanib, might hold promise also for the pulmonary fibrosis seen in sarcoidosis. Treating physicians have to actively look for potentially treatable complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, cardiac disease or infections before patients should be classified as treatment-refractory. Ultimately, lung transplantation has to be considered as treatment option for patients not responding to medical therapy.

A proportion of patients with autoimmune ILDs develop a progressive fibrosing form of ILD, characterized by increasing fibrosis on high-resolution computed tomography, worsening of lung function, and early mortality. Autoimmune disease-related ILDs have a variable clinical course and not all patients will require treatment, but all patients should be monitored for signs of progression. Apart from systemic sclerosis-associated ILD, the limited evidence to support the efficacy of immunosuppression as a treatment for ILDs is based mainly on small retrospective series and expert opinion. Non-clinical data suggest that there are commonalities in the mechanisms that drive progressive fibrosis in ILDs with an immunological trigger as in other forms of progressive fibrosing ILD. This suggests that nintedanib and pirfenidone, drugs known to slow disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, may also slow the progression of ILD associated with systemic autoimmune diseases.

Recently, nintedanib has been reported to exert anti-fibrotic activity on systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc) skin fibroblasts and to diminish skin and lung fibrosis in mouse models. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of nintedanib on a cellular model of SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD). Study was performed using lung fibroblasts (LF) isolated from five patients with SSc-ILD and from three control subjects. Nintedanib inhibited LF proliferation and migration in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The proliferation rate of LF stimulated with PDGF in the presence of nintedanib was reduced 1.9-fold within 24 h as compared to cells stimulated with PDGF alone. Migration of SSc-ILD LF incubated with 100 nM nintedanib was reduced from 62.8\u00b112.5% to 39.1\u00b19.0% in the presence of PDGF and from 38.2\u00b17.9% to 26.6\u00b17.2% in serum-free medium. Nintedanib attenuated PDGF-induced Ca2+ efflux, reduced \u03b1-SMA promoter activity and \u03b1-SMA protein expression. Furthermore, nintedanib blocked PDGF-induced differentiation of normal LF to myofibroblasts, reduced production of collagen and fibronectin, and decreased contractility of SSc-ILD LF in both floating and fixed collagen gels. Our data demonstrate significant antifibrotic efficacy of nintedanib in SSc-ILD LF suggesting that nintedanib has the potential not only to prevent but also to reverse the increased activity of LF consequently attenuating excessive lung fibrosis observed in SSc-ILD.",

Our study reveals that compound characterization based on three cell lines at two time points results in more genes being affected than six cell lines at a single time point. Based on the available LINCS data, we conclude that the most optimal experimental design to characterize a large set of compounds is to test them in duplicate in three different cell lines.

However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the druggable genome. As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to integrate, navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity, function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to auto-generate most axioms from a database while supporting manual knowledge acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitate ontology development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target disease relationships. DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models, drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery. The first version of DTO is publically available via the website http://drugtargetontology.org/ , Github ( http://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO ), and the NCBO Bioportal ( http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DTO ).

The first anti-CGRP treatment, an intravenous CGRP-receptor antagonist or gepant, olcegepant, was described as effective in terminating migraines in humans in 2004. Methods - The author briefly reviews some of the pathophysiology and translational research that led to the development of the gepants initially and then subsequently to the anti-CGRP and anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibodies. All accessible randomized controlled trials, abstracts, platform presentations, and press releases on the monoclonal antibody trials are summarized. The trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments. Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018. At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine, galcanezumab and fremanezumab.

We applied this strategy for another late-stage clinical program: ubrogepant (MK-1602), a novel oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for acute treatment of migraine. At the time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed between blood and plasma concentrations from concurrently collected samples in a phase 1 (healthy subjects) and phase 2 (target patient population) study using graphical and population PK approaches. This integrated information was presented to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory input. Following regulatory concurrence, DBS was poised for use in further clinical studies. Population PK modeling was used to dissect sources of variability contributing to DBS collection in the outpatient setting. What has been learned from this program has informed the broader integrated strategy of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, NJ) for DBS implementation in clinical trials and research to improve the precision of PK data collected in an outpatient setting.",

This double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized 834 participants to treat one migraine attack with ubrogepant 1 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The co-primary endpoints were pain freedom and headache response at two hours. The first primary hypothesis tested the dose-response trend for two-hour pain freedom using a logistic regression model. Subsequent hypotheses tested the effects of each dose on the co-primary endpoints, using a closed sequential testing procedure to control for multiplicity. A total of 527 participants received ubrogepant and 113 received placebo. A positive response trend in the proportion of participants achieving two-hour pain freedom was demonstrated (p &lt; 0.001). Ubrogepant 100 mg was significantly superior to placebo for two-hour pain freedom (25.5% vs 8.9%) but not for two-hour headache response. Per the prespecified multiplicity strategy, this nonsignificant result precluded further formal hypothesis testing, although the 50 mg and 25 mg doses demonstrated nominal significance over placebo for two-hour pain freedom (unadjusted p &lt; 0.05). Overall, adverse events were similar between ubrogepant and placebo. This trial supports ubrogepant's efficacy and provides further evidence that CGRP-RAs are viable options for the acute treatment of migraine.",

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (gepants-rimegepant and ubrogepant) and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists (ditans-lasmiditan) have completed phase 3 clinical trials and will soon offer novel, effective, well-tolerated nonvasoconstrictor options to treat acute migraine. CGRP preventive treatment is being revolutionized after the licensing of 3 monoclonal antibodies (MABs), erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, with eptinezumab to follow, especially designed for migraine; they are effective and well tolerated. For patients seeking a nondrug therapy, neuromodulation approaches, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS), and external trigeminal nerve stimulation, represent licensed, well-tolerated approaches to migraine treatment. For the acute treatment of episodic cluster headache, nVNS is effective, well tolerated, and licensed; nVNS is effective and well tolerated in preventive treatment of cluster headache. The CGRP MAB galcanezumab was effective and well tolerated in a placebo-controlled trial in the preventive treatment of episodic cluster headache. Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in 2 randomized sham-controlled studies on chronic cluster headache. Understanding the premonitory (prodromal) phase of migraine during which patients experience symptoms such as yawning, tiredness, cognitive dysfunction, and food cravings may help explain apparent migraine triggers in some patients, thus offering better self-management. Headache medicine has made remarkable strides, particularly in understanding migraine and cluster headache in the past 5 years. For the most common reason to visit a neurologist, therapeutic advances offer patients reduced disability and neurologists a rewarding, key role in improving the lives of those with migraine and cluster headache.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31020659": "Several lines of evidence pointed to an important role for CGRP in migraine. These included the anatomic colocalization of CGRP and its receptor in sensory fibers innervating pain-producing meningeal blood vessels, its release by trigeminal stimulation, the observation of elevated CGRP in the cranial circulation during migraine with normalization concomitant with headache relief by sumatriptan, and translational studies with intravenous (IV) CGRP that evoked migraine only in migraineurs. The development of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (CGRP-RAs) that showed clinical antimigraine efficacy acutely and prophylactically in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials subsequently gave definitive pharmacological proof of the importance of CGRP in migraine. More recently, CGRP target engagement imaging studies using a CGRP receptor PET ligand [<sup>11</sup> C]MK-4232 demonstrated that there was no brain CGRP receptor occupancy at clinically effective antimigraine doses of telcagepant, a prototypic CGRP-RA. Taken together, these data indicated that (1) the therapeutic site of action of the CGRP-RAs was peripheral not central; (2) that IV CGRP had most likely evoked migraine through an action at sites outside the blood-brain barrier; and (3) that migraine pain was therefore, at least in part, peripheral in origin. The evolution of CGRP migraine science gave impetus to the development of peripherally acting drugs that could modulate CGRP chronically to prevent frequent episodic and chronic migraine. Large molecule biologic antibody (mAb) approaches that are given subcutaneously to neutralize circulating CGRP peptide (fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or block CGRP receptors (erenumab) have shown consistent efficacy and tolerability in multicenter migraine prevention trials and are now approved for clinical use. Eptinezumab, a CGRP neutralizing antibody given IV, shows promise in late stage clinical development. Recently, orally administered next-generation small molecule CGRP-RAs have been shown to have safety and efficacy in acute treatment (ubrogepant and rimegepant) and prevention (atogepant) of migraine, giving additional CGRP-based therapeutic options for migraine patients.",

We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and side-effect profile of ubrogepant. We assigned adults with migraine, with or without aura, in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive an initial dose of placebo, ubrogepant at a dose of 50 mg, or ubrogepant at a dose of 100 mg for treatment of a single migraine attack, with the option to take a second dose. The coprimary efficacy end points were freedom from pain at 2 hours after the initial dose and absence of the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at 2 hours. Secondary end points included pain relief (at 2 hours), sustained pain relief (from 2 to 24 hours), sustained freedom from pain (from 2 to 24 hours), and absence of symptoms associated with migraine (photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea) at 2 hours. A total of 1672 participants were enrolled; 559 were assigned to receive placebo, 556 to receive 50 mg of ubrogepant, and 557 to receive 100 mg of ubrogepant. The percentage of participants who had freedom from pain at 2 hours was 11.8% in the placebo group, 19.2% in the 50-mg ubrogepant group (P = 0.002, adjusted for multiplicity, for the comparison with placebo), and 21.2% in the 100-mg ubrogepant group (P&lt;0.001). The percentage of participants who had freedom from the most bothersome symptom at 2 hours was 27.8% in the placebo group, 38.6% in the 50-mg ubrogepant group (P = 0.002), and 37.7% in the 100-mg ubrogepant group (P = 0.002). Adverse events within 48 hours after the initial or optional second dose were reported in 12.8% of participants in the placebo group, in 9.4% in the 50-mg ubrogepant group, and in 16.3% in the 100-mg ubrogepant group. The most common adverse events were nausea, somnolence, and dry mouth (reported in 0.4 to 4.1%); these events were more frequent in the 100-mg ubrogepant group (reported in 2.1 to 4.1%). Serious adverse events reported within 30 days in the ubrogepant groups included appendicitis, spontaneous abortion, pericardial effusion, and seizure; none of the events occurred within 48 hours after the dose. A higher percentage of participants who received ubrogepant than of those who received placebo had freedom from pain and absence of the most bothersome symptom at 2 hours after the dose. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, somnolence, and dry mouth.

The E-R model describes the placebo and ubrogepant treatment effects based on migraine pain end points (2-hour pain relief and 2-hour pain freedom) at various dose levels. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate various assumptions of placebo response in light of the high placebo response observed in one phase II trial. A population pharmacokinetic model describing the effect of formulations was included in the E-R simulation framework to assess potential dose implications of a formulation switch from phase II to phase III.

In the dose-escalation phase, 25 patients with heavily pretreated MM (22) or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (3) were administered selinexor (3-60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in 8 or 10 doses per 28-day cycle. In the dose-expansion phase, 59 patients with MM received selinexor at 45 or 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> with 20 mg dexamethasone, twice weekly in 28-day cycles, or selinexor (40 or 60 mg flat dose) without corticosteroids in 21-day cycles. The most common nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were nausea (75%), fatigue (70%), anorexia (64%), vomiting (43%), weight loss (32%), and diarrhea (32%), which were primarily grade 1 or 2. The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs were hematologic, particularly thrombocytopenia (45%).

Based on these RCTs, next-generation proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), next-generation immunomodulatory agent (pomalidomide), and monoclonal antibodies (elotuzumab and daratumumab) were approved for relapsed and refractory MM. Daratumumab, targeting CD38, has multiple mechanisms of action including modulation of the immunosuppressive bone marrow micro-environment. In addition to the remarkable single agent activity in refractory MM, daratumumab produced deep responses and superior PFS in MM when combined with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, or bortezomib/dexamethasone. Other anti-CD38 antibodies, such as isatuximab and MOR202, are undergoing assessment. Elotuzumab, targeting SLAMF7, yielded superior response rates and PFS when combined with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. New combinations of these next generation novel agents and/or antibodies are undergoing clinical trials. Venetoclax, an oral BH3 mimetic inhibiting BCL2, showed single agent activity in MM with t(11;14), and is being studied in combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone.

We studied selinexor in combination with low-dose dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma refractory to the most active available agents. Patients and Methods This phase II trial evaluated selinexor 80 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg, both orally and twice weekly, in patients with myeloma refractory to bortezomib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide (quad-refractory disease), with a subset also refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody (penta-refractory disease). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Results Of 79 patients, 48 had quad-refractory and 31 had penta-refractory myeloma. Patients had received a median of seven prior regimens. The ORR was 21% and was similar for patients with quad-refractory (21%) and penta-refractory (20%) disease.

Current therapeutic strategies include combination and sequential treatments with corticosteroids, alkylating agents, proteasomal inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies. These drugs prolong survival but ultimately become ineffective. Exportin 1 (XPO1), a nuclear export protein, is overexpressed in MM cells, and knockdown studies have suggested that XPO1 is essential for MM cell survival. Selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds are novel, orally bioavailable class of agents that specifically inhibit XPO1. Selinexor (KPT-330) is the first-in-human SINE compound. Early phase clinical trials have established the safety profile of this agent and have shown promising efficacy in combination with low-dose dexamethasone and other anti-MM agents. The combination of selinexor and dexamethasone has demonstrated activity in \"penta-refractory\" MM, (ie, MM refractory to the 5 most active anti-MM agents currently used in treatment).

The backbone therapy for the treatment of MM patients almost always includes combinations with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DEX). We found that DEX in combination with selinexor, an inhibitor of exportin-1 (XPO1) activity, synergistically inhibits the mTOR pathway and subsequently promotes cell death in MM cells. Specifically, we show that selinexor induces the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and when combined with dexamethasone increases GR transcriptional activity. Moreover, we found that key downstream targets of the mTOR pathway are deregulated by the combination and identified a mechanism in which GR enhances the expression of REDD1 in GR positive cells while suppressing mTOR activity and cell viability. While the single agent activity of selinexor in MM cells appears to be GR-independent, synergy with DEX depends on GR expression. These data suggest that patients with tumor cells that are GR positive will benefit substantially from the combination. The current findings are consistent with the beneficial therapeutic outcome in patients with MM when treated with the combination of selinexor and DEX. In addition, they provide a rationale for testing GR and REDD1 as predictive and prognostic markers of response, respectively, for patients treated with this beneficial combination.",

The clinical variability of HSPs is associated with a wide genetic heterogeneity, with more than eighty causative genes known. Recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed increasing genetic definition in such a heterogeneous group of disorders. We report on a 56- year-old man affected by sporadic complicated HSP consisting of a pyramidal syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataract, pes cavus, axonal sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy and cognitive decline. Brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy and thin corpus callosum. By NGS we found a novel homozygous biallelic c.452-1G &gt; C mutation in the b-glucosidase 2 gene (GBA2), known to be causative for autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 46 (SPG46). The rarity of this inherited form besides reporting on a novel mutation, expands the genetic and clinical spectrum of SPG46 related HSP.",

Our group has previously identified the <i>GBA2</i> c.1780G&gt;C [p.Asp594His] missense mutation, in a Cypriot consanguineous family with spastic ataxia. In this study, we carried out a biochemical characterization of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from three patients of this family. We found that the mutation strongly reduce NLGase activity both intracellularly and at the plasma membrane level. Additionally, we observed a two-fold increase of GlcCer content in LCLs derived from patients compared to controls, with the C<sub>16</sub> lipid being the most abundant GlcCer species. Moreover, we showed that there is an apparent compensatory effect between NLGase and the lysosomal glucosylceramidase (GCase), since we found that the activity of GCase was three-fold higher in LCLs derived from patients compared to controls. We conclude that the c.1780G&gt;C mutation results in NLGase loss of function with abolishment of the enzymatic activity and accumulation of GlcCer accompanied by a compensatory increase in GCase.",

This difference is attributed, at least in part, to the intrinsic ability of PNS neurons to activate a unique regenerative transcriptional program following injury. Here, we profiled gene expression following sciatic nerve crush in mice and identified long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that act in the regenerating neurons and which are typically not expressed in other contexts. We show that two of these lncRNAs regulate the extent of neuronal outgrowth. We then focus on one of these, Silc1, and show that it regulates neuroregeneration in cultured cells and in vivo, through cis-acting activation of the transcription factor Sox11.",

This paper explores how, and to what extent, New Zealand adolescents are typically using and exposed to active cellphones and cordless phones, and considers implications of this in relation to brain tumour risk, with reference to current research findings. This cross-sectional study recruited 373 Year 7 and 8 school students with a mean age of 12.3 years (range 10.3-13.7 years) from the Wellington region of New Zealand. Participants completed a questionnaire and measured their normal body-to-phone texting distances. Main exposure-metrics included self-reported time spent with an active cellphone close to the body, estimated time and number of calls on both phone types, estimated and actual extent of SMS text-messaging, cellphone functions used and people texted. Statistical analyses used Pearson Chi2 tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Analyses were undertaken using SPSS version 19.0. Both cellphones and cordless phones were used by approximately 90% of students. A third of participants had already used a cordless phone for \u2265 7 years. In 4 years from the survey to mid-2013, the cordless phone use of 6% of participants would equal that of the highest Interphone decile (\u2265 1640 hours), at the surveyed rate of use. High cellphone use was related to cellphone location at night, being woken regularly, and being tired at school. More than a third of parents thought cellphones carried a moderate-to-high health risk for their child. While cellphones were very popular for entertainment and social interaction via texting, cordless phones were most popular for calls. If their use continued at the reported rate, many would be at increased risk of specific brain tumours by their mid-teens, based on findings of the Interphone and Hardell-group studies.",

The recent studies reach very different conclusions. With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone studies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the cellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor cases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and (11) funding bias. The Interphone studies have all 11 flaws, and the Swedish studies have 3 flaws (8, 9 and 10). The data from the Swedish studies are consistent with what would be expected if cellphone use were a risk for brain tumors, while the Interphone studies data are incredulous. If a risk does exist, the public health cost will be large. These are the circumstances where application of the Precautionary Principle is indicated, especially if low-cost options could reduce the absorbed cellphone radiation by several orders of magnitude.",

The mechanism underpinning the antitumor effect of metformin has not been well established. Studies have demonstrated that reducing insulin and insulin-like growth factor levels in the peripheral blood circulation may lead to the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling or activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which inhibits mTOR signaling, a process that may be associated with the antitumor effect of metformin.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and its inhibition restores the insulin resistance. This study investigated the antitumor effect of metformin on endometrial cancer with a focus on PP2A. Metformin (1,500-2,250 mg/day) was preoperatively administered to patients with endometrial cancer for 4 to 6 weeks. Expression of the PP2A regulatory subunits, 4 (PPP2R4) and B (PP2A-B), was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using paired specimens obtained before and after metformin treatment. The effect of PPP2R4 inhibition with small interfering RNA was evaluated in the endometrial cancer cell lines HEC265 and HEC1B. P values of &lt; .05 were considered statistically significant. Preoperative metformin treatment significantly reduced the expression of PP2A-B, as determined using IHC, and the mRNA expression of PPP2R4, as determined using RT-PCR, in the patients with endometrial cancer. However, metformin could not directly alter the PPP2R4 mRNA levels in the endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro. PPP2R4 knockdown reduced the proliferation and induced the apoptosis by activating caspases 3/7 in HEC265 and HEC1B cells. Downregulation of the PP2A-B subunit, including PPP2R4, is an important indirect target of metformin. Inhibition of PP2A may be an option for the treatment of endometrial cancer patients with insulin resistance. This trial is registered with UMIN-CTR (number UMIN000004852).",

In the present study, we adopted a spontaneous PDAC mouse model named LSL\u2011Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; Trp53<sup>fl/+</sup>; Pdx1\u2011Cre (KPC) mice to explore the mechanism of the modulation of tumor angiogenesis and chemosensitization of metformin by treating KPC mice with metformin, gemcitabine or a combination of the two. H&amp;E staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemical staining were adopted to describe the histopathology and biomarkers of the KPC in different groups. Metformin plus gemcitabine reduced tumorigenic potential of PDAC. Specifically, metformin showed an anti-pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) effect via decreasing the expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and then sparked some downstream effects, for example, inhibiting the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the tumor microenvironment, reducing the formation of tumor neovascularization, attenuating the desmoplastic reaction and enhancing the antitumor effect of gemcitabine.

The largest tumor was adjacent to the pons and left trigeminal nerve but did not cause any direct neurologic symptoms or facial pain. Nine months after radiosurgical treatment of the tumors, the patient developed left sided typical trigeminal facial pain and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the marked reduction in the tumor size. The patient was subsequently treated with radiosurgery to the Gasserian ganglion with a resolution of facial pain. This article reviews the unique characteristics and unusual response to the radiation induced meningiomas to radiosurgery. This is a case of rapid shrinkage of the tumor seen on follow-up MRI scans, concurrent with the development of facial pain, suggests that the rapid shrinkage led to traction on adhesions and related microvasculature changes adjacent to the tumor and trigeminal nerve roots causing the subsequent trigeminal neuralgia.",

The sudden increase in ROS shifts the natural balance toward a pro-oxidative state, resulting in oxidative stress. The detrimental effects of oxidative stress occur through multiple mechanisms that involve alterations to proteins and lipids, induction of inflammation, immunosuppression, DNA damage, and activation of signaling pathways that affect gene transcription, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. All of these alterations promote carcinogenesis and therefore, regulation of ROS levels is critical to the maintenance of normal skin homeostasis. Several botanical products have been found to exhibit potent antioxidant capacity and the ability to counteract UV-induced insults to the skin. These natural products exert their beneficial effects through multiple pathways, including some known to be negatively affected by solar UVR. Aging of the skin is also accelerated by UVR exposure, in particular UVA rays that penetrate deep into the epidermis and the dermis where it causes the degradation of collagen and elastin fibers via oxidative stress and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Because natural compounds are capable of attenuating some of the UV-induced aging effects in the skin, increased attention has been generated in the area of cosmetic sciences. The focus of this review is to cover the most prominent phytoproducts with potential to mitigate the deleterious effects of solar UVR and suitability for use in topical application.",

In this study for the first time, we investigated the photoprotective action of neferine, against UV-B-produced oxidative damage in human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs). We established an in Vitro study model using HEKs. Cellular viability was determined by MMT assay kits. The intracellular oxidative stress was measured using ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay kits. Endogenous antioxidants were measured by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) assay kits. Photoprotective nature of neferine was further evaluated by analyzing the morphological and ultrastructural alterations in keratinocytes. Neferine inhibit the UV-B-mediated increase in ROS and MDA levels in pretreated keratinocytes. The antioxidants, SOD and GPx activities were significantly high in neferine pretreated UV-B groups. Mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum damage were less evident in neferine-pretreated UV-B groups as compared with the control group, which might be associated with reduced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.

Moreover, neferine treatment significantly inhibited UV-A induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression in HDFs. Remarkable morphological and ultrastructural alterations observed in HDFs upon UV-A irradiation, were also reduced with neferine treatment.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28566124": "Skin damage induced by UVR is an escalating problem in dermatology, and increasing incidence of skin cancer, especially for non-melanoma skin cancer, has been reported worldwide. UVR from sun exposure and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to be a pivotal factor in the aetiology of skin cancer. The pineal hormone melatonin is recognized as the most potent endogenous antioxidant. Melatonin conducts its antioxidant effects acting directly as a radical scavenger and indirectly by up regulation of antioxidant enzymes. It has been proposed, that melatonin may have a protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage. The aim of this thesis was to: - Clarify melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage in laboratory and clinical settings trough a systematic review of the literature. - To clinically assess the protective effect of topical treatment with melatonin against natural sun exposure, and determine the optimal concentration. - To clinically evaluate the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin. Study 1: This was a systematic review using the databases Pubmed, EM-BASE and Cinahl. The databases were searched up to January 2013 to identify studies evaluating melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced erythema in humans, and damage on a cellular level. Twenty studies were included, four human and 16 experimental. The results indicated that melatonin had a protective effect against UVR-induced erythema if applied before exposure, and this effect was probably obtained by melatonin acting directly as an antioxidant, and indirectly by regulating gene expression and inducing a DNA stabilizing effect. As these results were obtained using artificial UVR-sources and without investigating possible side effects, studies using natural sunlight and evaluating possible side effects of topical melatonin administration were warranted. Study 2: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We evaluated the protective effect of three different doses of topical melatonin against erythema induced by natural sun-light. The primary outcome was reduction in erythema, evaluated by chromatography, after sun exposure, when treated with topi-cal melatonin (0.5%, 2.5%, 12.5%) versus placebo and no treatment. A significant difference in erythema formation was found between areas treated with melatonin 12.5% and areas receiving placebo or no treatment. However, this was only seen in participants with an erythema reaction to the sun exposure. Further-more, the treated skin areas were very small and studies assessing any potential adverse effects were necessary. Study 3: This also was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. We assessed the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin 12.5%. Cognition was evaluated using a neuropsychological test battery consisting of Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), finger tapping test (FTT) and continuous reaction time (CRT). The impact on KSS was the primary outcome. We found no significant effect on cognition, however, large inter-individual variation was observed. These results support that melatonin is a safe drug for dermal application. The studies in this thesis may be valuable in the research field of melatonin's protective potential against UVR-induced oxidative skin damage. Increasing incidence of skin cancer is reported worldwide, and experts have suggested that the problem will only increase further, due to depletion of the ozone layer and the aging population. Furthermore, high-risk patient groups are emerging with the widely use of immunosuppressive medicine in various diseases, and this high-risk is in spite of use of protective measures known today. Therefore, development of new and more effective sun protective agents, with other qualities than simple chemical reflection of the UVR, is more important than ever. We have supported the suggestion of melatonin as a sun protective agent, and added the clinical relevant feature, that melatonin also has a protective effect against natural sunlight. Furthermore, we have supported the idea of melatonin being a safe drug for topical treatment, even in previous unknown high dosages. However, before any clinical implementation of melatonin as a sun protective agent can take place, further studies evaluating the long-term effects are warranted.",

The type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase has characteristics that allow keratinocytes to respond to/recover from, environmental insults to the skin. This response may depend on its roles in epidermal proliferation and early differentiation, and its rapid activation in response to changes in the cellular chemical milieu, including increased oxidative stress. We investigate the regulation of matriptase activation and its role in the response of the skin to exposure to different parts of the UV spectrum including UVA UVB, and UVR. The activation state and distribution of matriptase in ex vivo UV exposed human skin specimens and sun damaged skin samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes were also used to investigate the mechanism of matriptase zymogen activation induced by UV irradiation. Levels of cytosolic ROS were determined by H2DCF assay. Activated matriptase, PARP and caspase 3 cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting, and the apoptotic ratio was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining. UVB exposure rapidly increased matriptase zymogen activation in the basal keratinocytes of skin samples. Activated matriptase was also detected at much higher levels in both the basal and spinous layer keratinocytes in sun damaged skin with actinic elastosis. UVB and solar light-induced matriptase zymogen activation likely results from UV-induced ROS generation, given that UVR, UVA, and UVB irradiation induced HaCaT human keratinocytes to activate matriptase in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and that this was suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-tert-butyl-\u03b1-phenylnitrone and reducing agent dithiothreitol. Matriptase deficient HaCaT keratinocytes were more susceptible to UV-induced apoptosis than control cells, suggesting a protective role for matriptase in UV exposed keratinocytes. UV irradiation/ROS induced matriptase proteolysis may have short term protective effects and contribute to the recovery from acute epidermal damage and/or pathology of skin with chronic sun damage.",

Myelitis has been observed less commonly in other connective tissue diseases, mostly in antiphospholipid syndrome, and rarely in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Beh\u00e7et's disease and mixed connective tissue disease. Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) may also be present in diseases of various etiology, including multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, infectious diseases and malignancies. Myelitis in SLE is manifested as a dramatic spinal cord injury leading to paralysis or muscular paresis, sensory deficits, and smooth muscle dysfunction usually in the form of sphincter dysfunction. The imaging technique of choice in case of suspected ATM is magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous contrast agent (gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacid). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination in patients with ATM in the course of SLE indicate usually pleocytosis with prevalence of granulocytes, increased protein levels, low glucose levels, significantly hindering differential diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. Observations made by the authors (2 female patients with SLE) show that antibodies specific to SLE can be found in the CSF collected in the acute phase of myelitis. These observations have not yet been confirmed by other researchers. Early introduction of intravenous immunosuppression with large doses of cyclophosphamide and glucocorticosteroids improves the long-term prognosis. Other therapeutic approaches have been also used in more severe cases. Even with appropriate therapy, prognosis in this disease is uncertain.",

The findings of reduced levels of CD19 are implicative for the efficacy of epratuzumab in autoimmune diseases because elevated CD19 has been correlated with susceptibility to SLE in animal models as well as in patients.

ANCA was initially detected using indirect immunofluorescence, allowing for different patterns such as p-ANCA (perinuclear) and c-ANCA (cytoplasmic) to be distinguished. Today it is common to detect the antibodies by immunochemical assays such as ELISA using purified proteins as antigens. The strongest association with ANCA is found in the pauci-immune small vessel vasculitides granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). There is compelling evidence that ANCA contributes to the pathogenesis in these conditions. ANCA also occurs in 30%-40% of patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and anti-GBM disease, but is uncommon in other forms of vasculitis. ANCA with different specificities have been described with varying frequencies in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, endocarditis, chronic infections and hematopoietic malignancies. ANCA can also develop as an adverse event during pharmacological treatment. These entities are treated quite differently, with therapies ranging from immunosuppressive agents over antibiotics to simply removing the causative drug.

In this study, we created and tested a Dam Identification (DamID) system induced by Cre recombinase using Lamin B1 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Expression of this fusion protein in vivo leads to preferential methylation of adenines in DNA surrounding the native binding sites of the dam fusion partner. Because adenine methylation does not occur endogenously in most eukaryotes, it provides a unique tag to mark protein interaction sites. The adenine-methylated DNA fragments are isolated by selective polymerase chain reaction amplification and can be identified by microarray hybridization.

Our results demonstrate dramatic changes to transcription and chromatin structure in the mutant, including elevated antisense transcripts at &gt;70% of all genes and general loss of the +1 nucleosome. Furthermore, Spt6 is required for marks associated with active transcription, including trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 4, previously observed in humans but not Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and lysine 36.

To gain new insights into the roles of Spt6, we measured nucleosome occupancy along Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III in an spt6 mutant. We found that the level of nucleosomes is greatly reduced across some, but not all, coding regions in an spt6 mutant, with nucleosome loss preferentially occurring over highly transcribed genes. This result provides strong support for recent studies that have suggested that transcription at low levels does not displace nucleosomes, while transcription at high levels does, and adds the idea that Spt6 is required for restoration of nucleosomes at the highly transcribed genes. Unexpectedly, our studies have also suggested that the spt6 effects on nucleosome levels across coding regions do not cause the spt6 effects on mRNA levels, suggesting that the role of Spt6 across coding regions is separate from its role in transcriptional regulation. In the case of the CHA1 gene, regulation by Spt6 likely occurs by controlling the position of the +1 nucleosome. These results, along with previous studies, suggest that Spt6 regulates transcription by controlling chromatin structure over regulatory regions, and its effects on nucleosome levels over coding regions likely serve an independent function.",

We show that an N-terminal region of Spt6 (Spt6N) is responsible for interaction with Iws1. The crystallographic structures of Encephalitozoon cuniculi Iws1 and the Iws1/Spt6N complex reveal two conserved binding subdomains in Iws1. The first subdomain (one HEAT repeat; HEAT subdomain) is a putative phosphoprotein-binding site most likely involved in an Spt6-independent function of Iws1. The second subdomain (two ARM repeats; ARM subdomain) specifically recognizes a bipartite N-terminal region of Spt6. Mutations that alter this region of Spt6 cause severe phenotypes in vivo. Importantly, the ARM subdomain of Iws1 is conserved in several transcription factors, including TFIIS, Elongin A and Med26. We show that the homologous region in yeast TFIIS enables this factor to interact with SAGA and the Mediator subunits Spt8 and Med13, suggesting the molecular basis for TFIIS recruitment at promoters.

These effects are mediated through interactions with histones, transcription factors, and the RNA polymerase. Two lines of evidence suggest that Spt6 also plays a role in rRNA synthesis. First, Spt6 physically associates with a Pol I subunit (Rpa43). Second, Spt6 interacts physically and genetically with Spt4/5, which directly affects Pol I transcription. Utilizing a temperature-sensitive allele, spt6-1004, we show that Spt6 is essential for Pol I occupancy of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rRNA synthesis. Our data demonstrate that protein levels of an essential Pol I initiation factor, Rrn3, are reduced when Spt6 is inactivated, leading to low levels of Pol I-Rrn3 complex. Overexpression of RRN3 rescues Pol I-Rrn3 complex formation; however, rRNA synthesis is not restored. These data suggest that Spt6 is involved in either recruiting the Pol I-Rrn3 complex to the rDNA or stabilizing the preinitiation complex.

We identify the histone H3-H4 chaperone Spt6 as the factor that mediates nucleosome reassembly onto the PHO5, PHO8, ADH2, ADY2, and SUC2 promoters during transcriptional repression. Furthermore, promoter nucleosome reassembly is essential for transcriptional repression. In the absence of Spt6-mediated nucleosome reassembly, the activators Pho4 and Pho2 are displaced from the PHO5 promoter in repressing conditions, yet transcription is sustained. As such, these studies demonstrate that activators are not required for transcription in the absence of competing chromatin reassembly.",

We have isolated conditional mutations in SPT5 that can be suppressed in an allele-specific manner by mutations in the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Strikingly, one of these RNA Pol II mutants is defective for transcription elongation and the others cause phenotypes consistent with an elongation defect. In addition, we show that spt4, spt5, and spt6 mutants themselves have phenotypes suggesting defects in transcription elongation in vivo. Consistent with these findings, we show that Spt5 is physically associated with RNA Pol II in vivo, and have identified a region of sequence similarity between Spt5 and NusG, an Escherichia coli transcription elongation factor that binds directly to RNA polymerase. Finally, we show that Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex that does not contain Spt6.

Here we show that mutations in the three SPT genes also affect transcription of the histone genes that reside at the HTA1-HTB1 locus. HTA1-lacZ transcription was reduced in each spt mutant background, an effect that required a negative site in the HTA1 promoter. The transcriptional effect could be reversed by the overproduction of histones H2A and H2B in an spt4 mutant and histones H3 and H4 in all three spt mutants. Suppression of the spt4 transcriptional defect was dependent on the overproduction of both histones H2A and H2B, and required the presence of N-terminal amino acids in both histones. The results are consistent with the idea that the effects of the spt mutations on nucleosome assembly and/or stability activate repressors of HTA1 transcription.",

We have now analyzed interactions between SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6. First, the combination of mutations in any two of these three genes causes lethality in haploids. Second, some recessive mutations in different members of this set fail to complement each other. Third, mutations in all three genes alter transcription in similar ways.

In this study, we address a potential role of this kinase in chromatin modulations associated with transcription. We found that CK2 depletion from yeast cells leads to replication-independent increase of histone H3K56 acetylation and global activation of H3 turnover in coding regions. This suggests a positive role of CK2 in maintenance/recycling of the histone H3/H4 tetramers during transcription. Interestingly, strand-specific RNA-seq analyses show that CK2 inhibits global cryptic promoters driving both sense and antisense transcription. This further indicates a role of CK2 in the modulation of chromatin during transcription. Next, we showed that CK2 interacts with the major histone chaperone Spt6, and phosphorylates it in vivo and in vitro. CK2 phosphorylation of Spt6 is required for its cellular levels, for the suppression of histone H3 turnover and for the inhibition of spurious transcription. Finally, we showed that CK2 and Spt6 phosphorylation sites are important to various transcriptional responses suggesting that cryptic intragenic and antisense transcript production are associated with a defective adaptation to environmental cues.

Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671. Thus, several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network.",

Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture had shown that cohesin's main role in interphase genome organization is in mediating interactions within architectural chromosome compartments, rather than specifying compartments per se. However, it remains unclear how cohesin-mediated interactions contribute to the regulation of gene expression. We have found that the binding of CTCF and cohesin is highly enriched at enhancers and in particular at enhancer arrays or \"super-enhancers\" in mouse thymocytes. Using local and global chromosome conformation capture, we demonstrate that enhancer elements associate not just in linear sequence, but also in 3D, and that spatial enhancer clustering is facilitated by cohesin.

Thus, MAIT cells are reduced in MM patients, which may contribute to disease in these individuals, and moreover, MAIT cells may represent new immunotherapeutic targets for treatment of MM and other malignancies.",

Despite great therapeutic advances, most of the MM patients still relapse and remain incurable. Over the past years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new field in cancer therapy. Here, the immune cells of the patients themselves are activated to target the tumor cells. In MM, several effector cells of the immune system are present in the BM microenvironment; unfortunately, they are mostly all functionally impaired. In this review, we focus on the role of innate-like T cells in MM, particularly CD1d- and MR1- restricted T cells such as respectively invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. These cells have the capacity upon activation to rapidly release copious amounts of cytokines affecting a wide range of innate and adaptive immune responses, and could therefore play a key protective role in anti-tumor immunity. We describe recent observations with regard to functional exhaustion of iNKT and MAIT cells in MM pathology and discuss the potential application of checkpoint inhibition as an attractive target for prolonged activation of these immunomodulatory T cells in the treatment of MM.",

Specifically, super-enhancers are clusters of enhancers defined based on the binding occupancy of master transcription factors, chromatin regulators, or chromatin marks, while stretch enhancers are large chromatin-defined regulatory regions of at least 3,000 base pairs. Several studies have characterized these regulatory regions in numerous cell types and tissues to decipher their functional importance. However, the differences and similarities between these regulatory regions have not been fully assessed. We integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from ten human cell types to perform a comparative analysis of super and stretch enhancers with respect to their chromatin profiles, cell type-specificity, and ability to control gene expression. We found that stretch enhancers are more abundant, more distal to transcription start sites, cover twice as much the genome, and are significantly less conserved than super-enhancers. In contrast, super-enhancers are significantly more enriched for active chromatin marks and cohesin complex, and more transcriptionally active than stretch enhancers. Importantly, a vast majority of super-enhancers (85%) overlap with only a small subset of stretch enhancers (13%), which are enriched for cell type-specific biological functions, and control cell identity genes. These results suggest that super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell type-specific than stretch enhancers, and importantly, most of the stretch enhancers that are distinct from super-enhancers do not show an association with cell identity genes, are less active, and more likely to be poised enhancers.",

Previous randomized controlled trials of CoQ10 in HF were underpowered to address major clinical endpoints. Patients with moderate to severe HF were randomly assigned in a 2-year prospective trial to either CoQ10 100 mg 3 times daily or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. The primary short-term endpoints at 16 weeks were changes in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, 6-min walk test, and levels of N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide. The primary long-term endpoint at 2 years was composite major adverse cardiovascular events as determined by a time to first event analysis. A total of 420 patients were enrolled. There were no significant changes in short-term endpoints. The primary long-term endpoint was reached by 15% of the patients in the CoQ10 group versus 26% in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.32 to 0.80; p = 0.003) by intention-to-treat analysis. The following secondary endpoints were significantly lower in the CoQ10 group compared with the placebo group: cardiovascular mortality (9% vs. 16%, p = 0.026), all-cause mortality (10% vs. 18%, p = 0.018), and incidence of hospital stays for HF (p = 0.033). In addition, a significant improvement of NYHA class was found in the CoQ10 group after 2 years (p = 0.028).

About half of the patients with CdLS carry mutations in the NIPBL gene encoding the NIPBL protein, a subunit of the Cohesin loading complex. Recent studies show association of Cohesin with chromatin-remodeling complexes, either by establishing cohesion or by recruiting Cohesin to specific chromosome locations. In yeast two-hybrid assays, we identified an interaction of NIPBL with the histone deacetylases -1 and -3. These interactions were confirmed in mammalian cells by coimmunoprecipitation and a critical region for interaction was defined to a stretch of 163 amino acids of a highly conserved region of NIPBL, which is mutated in patients with CdLS. Utilizing reporter gene assays, we could show that NIPBL fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD) represses promoter activity via the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Interestingly, this effect is dramatically reduced by both NIPBL missense mutations identified in CdLS and by chemical inhibition of the histone deacetylases.

Heterozygous mutations in the cohesin regulator NIPBL or cohesin structural components SMC1A and SMC3 result in the multisystem developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS). Genome-wide assessment of transcription in 16 mutant cell lines from severely affected CdLS probands has identified a unique profile of dysregulated gene expression that was validated in an additional 101 samples and correlates with phenotypic severity. This profile could serve as a diagnostic and classification tool. Cohesin binding analysis demonstrates a preference for intergenic regions suggesting a cis-regulatory function mimicking that of a boundary/insulator interacting protein.

Mutations in core cohesin complex components have also been reported in individuals with CdLS-like phenotypes. In addition to its role in sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin is thought to play a role in regulating gene expression during development. The mechanism of this gene regulation remains unclear, but NIPBL and cohesin have been reported to affect long-range chromosomal interactions, both independently and through interactions with CTCF. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to investigate whether the disruption of NIPBL affects chromosome architecture. We show that cells from CdLS patients exhibit visible chromatin decompaction, that is most pronounced across gene-rich regions of the genome. Cells carrying mutations predicted to have a more severe effect on NIPBL function show more extensive chromatin decompaction than those carrying milder mutations. This cellular phenotype was reproduced in normal cells depleted for NIPBL with siRNA, but was not seen following the knockdown of either the cohesin component SMC3, or CTCF. We conclude that NIPBL has a function in modulating chromatin architecture, particularly for gene-rich areas of the chromosome, that is not dependent on SMC3/cohesin or CTCF, raising the possibility that the aetiology of disorders associated with the mutation of core cohesin components is distinct from that associated with the disruption of NIPBL itself in classical CdLS.",

The NIPBL protein is required for the loading of cohesin onto chromatin, but how and where cohesin is loaded in vertebrate cells is unclear. Heterozygous mutations of NIPBL were found in 50% of the cases of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a human developmental syndrome with a complex phenotype. However, no defects in the mitotic function of cohesin have been observed so far and the links between NIPBL mutations and the observed developmental defects are unclear. We show that NIPBL binds to chromatin in somatic cells with a different timing than cohesin. Further, we observe that high-affinity NIPBL binding sites localize to different regions than cohesin and almost exclusively to the promoters of active genes. NIPBL or cohesin knockdown reduce transcription of these genes differently, suggesting a cohesin-independent role of NIPBL for transcription. Motif analysis and comparison to published data show that NIPBL co-localizes with a specific set of other transcription factors. In cells derived from CdLS patients NIPBL binding levels are reduced and several of the NIPBL-bound genes have previously been observed to be mis-expressed in CdLS. In summary, our observations indicate that NIPBL mutations might cause developmental defects in different ways.

It has been proposed that the effects of Nipbl-haploinsufficiency result from disruption of long-range communication between DNA elements. Here we use zebrafish and mouse models of CdLS to examine how transcriptional changes caused by Nipbl deficiency give rise to limb defects, a common condition in individuals with CdLS. In the zebrafish pectoral fin (forelimb), knockdown of Nipbl expression led to size reductions and patterning defects that were preceded by dysregulated expression of key early limb development genes, including fgfs, shha, hand2 and multiple hox genes. In limb buds of Nipbl-haploinsufficient mice, transcriptome analysis revealed many similar gene expression changes, as well as altered expression of additional classes of genes that play roles in limb development. In both species, the pattern of dysregulation of hox-gene expression depended on genomic location within the Hox clusters. In view of studies suggesting that Nipbl colocalizes with the mediator complex, which facilitates enhancer-promoter communication, we also examined zebrafish deficient for the Med12 Mediator subunit, and found they resembled Nipbl-deficient fish in both morphology and gene expression. Moreover, combined partial reduction of both Nipbl and Med12 had a strongly synergistic effect, consistent with both molecules acting in a common pathway. In addition, three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that Nipbl and Med12 are required to bring regions containing long-range enhancers into close proximity with the zebrafish hoxda cluster. These data demonstrate a crucial role for Nipbl in limb development, and support the view that its actions on multiple gene pathways result from its influence, together with Mediator, on regulation of long-range chromosomal interactions.",

It has been suggested that intra-chromosome loops are generated by extrusion of DNAs through the lumen of cohesin's ring. Scc2 (Nipbl) stimulates cohesin's ABC-like ATPase and is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes. However, it is possible that the stimulation of cohesin's ATPase by Scc2 also has a post-loading function, for example driving loop extrusion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule tracking in human cells, we show that Scc2 binds dynamically to chromatin, principally through an association with cohesin. Scc2's movement within chromatin is consistent with a 'stop-and-go' or 'hopping' motion. We suggest that a low diffusion coefficient, a low stoichiometry relative to cohesin, and a high affinity for chromosomal cohesin enables Scc2 to move rapidly from one chromosomal cohesin complex to another, performing a function distinct from loading.",

NIPBL loads cohesin onto chromatin. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion important for mitosis but is also increasingly recognized as a regulator of gene expression. In CdLS patient cells and animal models, expression changes of multiple genes with little or no sister chromatid cohesion defect suggests that disruption of gene regulation underlies this disorder. However, the effect of <i>NIPBL</i> haploinsufficiency on cohesin binding, and how this relates to the clinical presentation of CdLS, has not been fully investigated. Nipbl haploinsufficiency causes CdLS-like phenotype in mice. We examined genome-wide cohesin binding and its relationship to gene expression using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from <i>Nipbl</i>+/- mice that recapitulate the CdLS phenotype. We found a global decrease in cohesin binding, including at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites and repeat regions. Cohesin-bound genes were found to be enriched for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at their promoters; were disproportionately downregulated in <i>Nipbl</i> mutant MEFs; and displayed evidence of reduced promoter-enhancer interaction. The results suggest that gene activation is the primary cohesin function sensitive to Nipbl reduction. Over 50% of significantly dysregulated transcripts in mutant MEFs come from cohesin target genes, including genes involved in adipogenesis that have been implicated in contributing to the CdLS phenotype. Decreased cohesin binding at the gene regions is directly linked to disease-specific expression changes. Taken together, our Nipbl haploinsufficiency model allows us to analyze the dosage effect of cohesin loading on CdLS development.",

NIPBL interacts with cohesin and then increases transcriptional activities of REC8 promoter, leading to up-regulation of gene expression.

In this study, chrysotile from Mangnai, Qinghai, China, and an artificial substitute, rock wool fiber were prepared as suspensions and were tested at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcg/ml in V79 lung fibroblasts. Chromosome aberrations were detected by micronucleus assay after exposure for 24 h, and DNA damage were estimated by single cell gel electrophoresis after exposure for 12, 24, or 48 h. According to the results, chrysotile and rock wool fibers caused micronuclei to form in a dose-dependent manner in V79 cells; olive tail moment values increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When V79 cells were exposed to a concentration of 200 \u03bcg/ml, the degree of DNA damage induced by chrysotile fibers was greater than rock wool fibers.

Globally, an estimated 107,000 people die annually from lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma, and asbestosis due to occupational asbestos exposure. Malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer are caused by all major types of asbestos. Asbestos causes more lung cancer deaths than malignant mesothelioma of the pleura; most cases of the latter are due to asbestos exposure. The cancer risk increases with cumulative asbestos exposure, with increased risk even at low levels of exposure to asbestos. Based on empirical studies, an estimated cumulative occupational exposure to asbestos of 1 fiber/mL-year substantially raises malignant mesothelioma risk. No safe threshold for asbestos exposure has been established for lung cancer and mesothelioma. The validity of fiber-type risk assessments depends critically on the quality of exposure assessments, which vary considerably, leading to a high degree of uncertainty. Asbestos exposure without asbestosis and smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. The joint effect of asbestos and smoking is supra-additive, which may depend in part on the presence of asbestosis. Asbestos workers who cease smoking experience a dramatic drop in lung cancer risk, which approaches that of nonsmokers after 30 years. Studies to date show that longer, thinner fibers have a stronger association with lung cancer than shorter, less thin fibers, but the latter nonetheless also show an association with lung cancer and mesothelioma.

This is a population study on aggregate level; the source of data was the Icelandic Cancer Registry, the National Cause-of-Death Registry, and the National Register. Volume of asbestos import was obtained from Customs Tariff. The import figures reflect fairly accurately the amount used, as there are no mines in the country. Asbestos import peaked in 1980 at 15.0 kg/capita/year, diminishing to 0.3 kg/capita/year ten years after the ban in 1983, and to zero in the most recent years. Seventy-nine per cent of the cases of malignant mesothelioma were men, and 72 % were of pleural origin. Mesothelioma incidence increased steadily from 1965 to 2014, when it reached 21.4 per million among men, and 5.6 among women. Mortality in 2014 was 22.2 per million among men, and 4.8 among women. Malignant mesothelioma incidence and mortality increased in the population during the period, despite the ban on asbestos use from 1983. This is in agreement with the long latency time for malignant mesothelioma. In line with the previously high per capita volume of asbestos import, many buildings, equipment, and structures contain asbestos, so there is an on-going risk of asbestos exposure during maintenance, renovations and replacements.

The NK cell line showed impaired cytotoxicity with altered expression of activating receptors upon exposure to asbestos, and primary NK cells in culture with asbestos and peripheral blood NK cells in mesothelioma shared a decrease in expression of NKp46, a representative activating receptor. The AM finding indicates that AM contribute to asbestosis by playing a direct role in the fibrogenic response, as well as the inflammatory response. The response of NK cells indicates that exposure to asbestos has an immune-suppressive effect, as well as a tumorigenic effect.

Patients with MPeM are younger than patients with pleural MM, and a higher proportion, mostly women, are long-term survivors. Most MPeM is caused by asbestos exposure.

The three major pathologic subtypes are epithelial, sarcomatoid, and biphasic. Most cases are epithelial; the others have a dismal prognosis. Two indolent subtypes of borderline malignant potential-well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma and benign multicystic mesothelioma-are more common in the peritoneum and are treated surgically. In highly selected patients receiving treatment at experienced referral centers, an aggressive locoregional strategy that combines cytoreductive surgery to remove all gross disease and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy to treat residual microscopic tumors yields a 3-year survival of 60% and a median survival approaching 5 years, far better than expected from historic controls.

Twenty patients (24%) had been exposed to erionite and 64 patients (76%) had been exposed to asbestos. The CT scans were interpreted by seven observers who did not know the clinical or pathologic findings. CT scans showed either unilateral pleural thickening or pleural nodules/masses in all patients. Pleural nodules were present in 25 patients (30%) and pleural masses in 44 patients (52%). Pleural effusion was found in 61 patients (73%), mediastinal pleural involvement in 78 (93%), pleural calcifications in 52 (62%), involvement of the interlobar fissures in 64 (76%), and volume contraction in 61 (73%). Reduced size of the hemithorax was significantly correlated with chest wall involvement. On the basis of CT findings, the preassigned staging was changed in 21 patients (25%), including 44% of the patients with disease that had been classified as stage I. CT findings were not significantly different between the patients exposed to erionite and those exposed to asbestos. The most common CT findings in cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma were unilateral pleural thickening or pleural nodules/masses with or without effusion. CT provided valuable information on the extent of the disease, which was important for staging. Although the CT features are not pathognomonic, they provide valuable clues to the diagnosis in patients who have been exposed to mineral fibers.",

Mesothelioma, similar to all asbestos-related diseases, is dose/intensity dependent to some degree, and studies showed the risk of mesothelioma rises with cumulative exposures. Multiple processes occur in an individual before mesothelioma occurs. The impact of mesothelioma in the United States has been continuous over the last half century, claiming between 2,000 and 3,000 lives each year. Mesothelioma is a preventable tumor that is more frequently reported as associated with asbestos exposure among men than women. However, the rate of asbestos-associated mesothelioma is on the rise among women due to better investigation into their histories of asbestos exposure. It is of interest that investigators detected asbestos-associated cases of mesothelioma in women from nonoccupational sources-that is, bystander, incidental, or take-home exposures. It is postulated that asbestos-associated mesotheliomas, in both men and women, are likely underreported. However, with the implementation of the most recent ICD-10 coding system, the correlation of mesothelioma with asbestos exposure is expected to rise to approximately 80% in the United States. This study examined the demographic and etiological nature of asbestos-related mesothelioma.",

A novel human coronavirus, subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. With increasing numbers of infections and deaths from MERS-CoV, development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. In this study, we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, as recommended by the world health organization (WHO). In this experimental study, acquiring patient samples was difficult; thus, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocols, we synthesized RNA sequences of upE and ORF1b genes as the template signatures and TaqMan based-diagnostic rRT-PCR assays were carried out using these synthetic genes for detection of MERS-CoV. In this research, we also inaugurated a cell-free system to transcribe these RNA sequences using the DNA templates synthesized. The upE and ORF1b based one-step rRT-PCR assays were optimized by testing several times via different synthetic RNAs, and validation results were highly successful. The sensitivity obtained for upE was fewer than ten copies of RNA template per reaction and for ORF1b was 50 or fewer copies per reaction. This study showed that the developed rRT-PCR assays are rapid, reliable, reproducible, specific, sensitive, and simple tools for detection of MERS-CoV. Finally, a kit consisting of two assay signatures and controls was assembled, which can be distributed to public health laboratories in Iran to support international MERS-CoV surveillance and public health response.",

The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a \"gold standard,\" it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns. We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection. Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%-63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%-70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients. These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas.",

We sought to discover novel, brain-penetrant 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors as potential medicines for the treatment of AD. Medicinal chemistry optimization of a series of amido-thiophene analogues was performed to identify potent and selective 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors with optimized oral pharmacokinetics able to access the brain. Single and multiple ascending dose studies were conducted in healthy human subjects to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the candidate compound. UE2343 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitor and selected for clinical studies. No major safety issues occurred in human subjects. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone was elevated (a marker of systemic enzyme inhibition) at doses of 10 mg and above, but plasma cortisol levels were unchanged. Following multiple doses of UE2343, plasma levels were approximately dose proportional and the terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> ranged from 10 to 14 h. The urinary tetrahydrocortisols/tetrahydrocortisone ratio was reduced at doses of 10 mg and above, indicating maximal 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibition in the liver. Concentrations of UE2343 in the CSF were 33% of free plasma levels, and the peak concentration in CSF was ninefold greater than the UE2343 IC<sub>50</sub> . UE2343 is safe, well tolerated and reaches the brain at concentrations predicted to inhibit 11\u03b2-HSD1. UE2343 is therefore a suitable candidate to test the hypothesis that 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibition in brain improves memory in patients with AD.",

In this study, we investigated the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a master regulator of antioxidant gene expression, in the growth and stress resistance of CSC-enriched mammosphere. The MCF7 mammospheres expressed significantly higher levels of the NRF2 protein and target gene expression compared to the monolayer. As underlying mechanisms, we observed that proteolytic activity and expression of the proteasome catalytic subunits were decreased in the mammospheres. Additionally, mammospheres retained a high level of p62 and the silencing of p62 was observed to attenuate NRF2 activation. NRF2 increase was confirmed in sphere-cultures of the colon and ovarian cancer cells. The functional implication of NRF2 was demonstrated in NRF2-knockdown mammospheres. NRF2-silenced mammospheres demonstrated increased cell death and retarded sphere growth as a result of target gene repression. Moreover, unlike the control mammospheres, NRF2-knockdown mammospheres did not develop anticancer drug resistance. Collectively, these results indicated that altered proteasome function and p62 expression caused NRF2 activation in CSC-enriched mammospheres. In addition, NRF2 appeared to play a role in CSC survival and anticancer drug resistance.",

Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",

Targeted suppression of antioxidant defenses could thus broadly improve therapeutic outcomes. Here, we identify the AMPK-related kinase NUAK1 as a key component of the antioxidant stress response pathway and reveal a specific requirement for this role of NUAK1 in colorectal cancer. We show that NUAK1 is activated by oxidative stress and that this activation is required to facilitate nuclear import of the antioxidant master regulator NRF2: Activation of NUAK1 coordinates PP1\u03b2 inhibition with AKT activation in order to suppress GSK3\u03b2-dependent inhibition of NRF2 nuclear import. Deletion of NUAK1 suppresses formation of colorectal tumors, whereas acute depletion of NUAK1 induces regression of preexisting autochthonous tumors. Importantly, elevated expression of NUAK1 in human colorectal cancer is associated with more aggressive disease and reduced overall survival.<b>Significance:</b> This work identifies NUAK1 as a key facilitator of the adaptive antioxidant response that is associated with aggressive disease and worse outcome in human colorectal cancer.

Among these noncoding RNAs are short RNAs, such as MicroRNAs, snoRNAs, and Piwi-interacting RNAs, and the functions of those are relatively well understood. Other noncoding RNAs are longer, and their modes of action and functions are also increasingly explored and deciphered. Short RNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) interact with each other with reciprocal consequences for their fates and functions. LncRNAs serve as precursors for many types of small RNAs and, therefore, the pathways for small RNA biogenesis can impinge upon the fate of lncRNAs. In addition, lncRNA expression can be repressed by small RNAs, and lncRNAs can affect small RNA activity and abundance through competition for binding or by triggering small RNA degradation.

To better understand its pharmacokinetics, we studied its interactions with the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 and the multidrug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A. In polarized MDCK-II cells, encorafenib was efficiently transported by canine and human ABCB1 and ABCG2 and by mouse Abcg2. Upon oral administration to wild-type, Abcb1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup>, Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup>, and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, encorafenib was absorbed very quickly and to very high plasma levels, but without clear changes in oral availability between the strains. Upon oral or intravenous administration, encorafenib brain accumulation was markedly increased in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice and to a lesser extent in Abcb1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, absolute brain concentrations and brain-to-plasma ratios remained very low in all strains, indicating intrinsically poor brain penetration of encorafenib. Upon intravenous administration, Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed somewhat reduced plasma elimination of encorafenib compared to wild-type mice, and lower accumulation of the drug in the intestinal tract, suggesting a limited role for these transporters in intestinal elimination of the drug. In Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup> mice plasma levels of encorafenib were not markedly increased, suggesting a limited impact of Cyp3a on encorafenib oral availability.

Inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi) and its target MEK are widely used to treat melanoma patients with BRAF mutations but unfortunately acquired resistance occurs in the majority of patients. Resistance results from mutations or non-genomic changes that either reactivate MAPK signalling or activate other pathways that provide alternate survival and growth signalling. Here, we show the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat overcomes BRAFi resistance in melanoma, but this is dependent on the resistant cells showing a partial response to BRAFi treatment. Using patient- and in vivo-derived melanoma cell lines with acquired BRAFi resistance, we show that combined treatment with the BRAFi encorafenib and HDACi panobinostat in 2D and 3D culture systems synergistically induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Key changes induced by HDAC inhibition included decreased PI3K pathway activity associated with a reduction in the protein level of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, and cell line dependent upregulation of pro-apoptotic BIM or NOXA together with reduced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Independent of these changes, panobinostat reduced c-Myc and pre-treatment of cells with siRNA against c-Myc reduced BRAFi/HDACi drug-induced cell death. These results suggest that a combination of HDAC and MAPK inhibitors may play a role in treatment of melanoma where the resistance mechanisms are due to activation of MAPK-independent pathways.",

Inhibitors selective for the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncoprotein, the most common BRAF mutant, elicit only poor response rates in BRAF-mutant CRC as single agents. This unresponsiveness was mechanistically attributed to the loss of negative feedbacks on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and initiated clinical trials that combine BRAF (and MEK) inhibitors, either singly or in combination, with the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. First results of these combinatorial studies demonstrated improved efficacy, however, the response rates still were heterogeneous. Here, we show that BRAF inhibition leads to the upregulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in CRC cell lines, including not only the EGFR, but also human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER3. Importantly, combination of the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib (PLX4032), dabrafenib, or encorafenib with inhibitors dually targeting the EGFR and HER2 (such as lapatinib, canertinib, and afatinib) significantly reduced the metabolic activity and proliferative potential of CRC cells. This re-sensitization was also observed after genetic depletion of HER2 or HER3. Interestingly, BRAF inhibitors did not only upregulate RTKs, but also increased the abundance of the GRB2-associated binders (Gab) 1 and Gab2, two important amplifiers of RTK signaling. An allele-specific shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> revealed that Gab2 upregulation was directly dependent on the loss of the oncoprotein and was not caused by an \"off-target\" effect of these kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, Gab2 and Gab2-mediated Shp2 signaling were shown to be functionally important in BRAFi resistance. These findings highlight potential new escape mechanisms to these targeted therapies and indicate that a broad suppression of RTK signaling might be beneficial and should be taken into account in future research addressing targeted therapy in BRAF-mutant CRC.",

BRAFi impaired MAPK signaling and cell growth in class I and II BRAF mutant cells. dMAPKi was more effective than either single MAPKi at inhibiting cell growth in all class II BRAF mutant cells tested. dMAPKi caused tumor regression in two melanoma PDXs with class II BRAF mutations and prolonged survival of mice with class II BRAF mutant melanoma brain metastases. Two patients with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma clinically responded to dMAPKi. Class II BRAF mutant melanoma is growth inhibited by dMAPKi.

However, treatment resistance and disease recurrence remain a clinical challenge. Areas covered: Encorafenib in combination with bimetinib offers a new approach that may offer benefits over existing BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations.

This improved efficacy may be related to the distinct pharmacokinetics of encorafenib, with prolonged binding to the target molecule providing greater BRAF inhibition and increased potency compared with other drugs in the same class. Increased specificity of encorafenib may also result in better tolerability with less off-target effects, including reduced occurrence of pyrexia and photosensitivity.

Moreover, LGX818 downregulated CyclinD1 in a glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2-independent manner and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, Surprisingly, LGX818 triggered cellular senescence in BRAFV600E melanoma cells, as evidenced by increased \u03b2-galactosidase staining, while no appreciable induction of apoptosis was detected, as determined by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining and immunoblot analysis of caspase-3 processing and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Increased p27KIP1 expression and retinoblastoma protein activation were detected during LGX818-induced senescence. Additionally, inhibition of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B by AZ191 reversed LGX818-induced CyclinD1 turnover and senescence. Interestingly, autophagy is triggered through inhibition of the mTOR/70S6K pathway during LGX818-induced senescence. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by pharmacological and genetic regulation attenuates LGX818-induced senescence.

In addition, inhibition of gamma-secretase results in a significant increase in the amount of alpha- and beta-secretase cleavage, further increasing the amount of APP-CTFs contained within these exosomes. We identify several key members of the secretase family of proteases (BACE, PS1, PS2, and ADAM10) to be localized in exosomes, suggesting they may be a previously unidentified site of APP cleavage. These results provide further evidence for a novel pathway in which APP fragments are released from cells and have implications for the analysis of APP processing and diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease.",

As a result, over the next two decades, fluoroscope operators suffered lethal skin carcinomas. Later, case reports appeared concerning leukemia in radiation workers, and infants born with severe mental retardation after their mothers had been given pelvic radiotherapy early in pregnancy. Fluoroscopy and radiotherapy for benign disorders continued to be used with abandon until authoritative reports were published on the adverse effects of ionizing radiation by the U.S. NAS-NRC and the UK MRC in 1956. Meanwhile, exposure to the atomic bombs in Japan had occurred and epidemics of delayed effects began to be recognized among the survivors: cataracts (1949), leukemia (1952) and severe mental retardation among newborn infants after intrauterine exposure (1952). No statistically significant excess of germ-cell genetic effects was detected by six clinical measurements (1956), the F1 mortality (1981), cytogenetic studies (1987) or biochemical genetic studies (1988). Somatic cell effects were revealed by long-lasting chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes (1968), and somatic cell mutations were found at the glycophorin A locus in erythrocytes (1992). Molecular biology is a likely focus of new studies based on the function of the gene for ataxia telangiectasia (1995), a disorder in which children have severe, even lethal acute radiation reactions when given conventional doses of radiotherapy for lymphoma, to which they are prone. Also, obligate heterozygote female relatives can be studied for increased susceptibility to radiation-induced breast cancer, as suggested by clinical studies. The tumor registries in Hiroshima and Nagasaki now provide incidence data that show the extent of increases in eight common cancers and no increase in eight others (1994). The possibility of very late effects of A-bomb exposure is suggested by recent reports of increased frequencies of hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid cancers and certain causes of death other than cancer.",

Mortality in this cohort has been under study since 1950. Deaths are routinely identified through the family registry system and ascertainment is virtually complete. Cancer incidence data for the LSS cohort are also available from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki population-based tumour registry established in 1958. The central finding of the LSS is an increase in cancer risk. Besides the well-known increase in leukaemia, increases in solid cancer such as cancers of the lung, breast, stomach and thyroid have also been demonstrated. Radiation-induced leukaemia occurred 2 to 3 years after exposure, reached its peak within 6 to 8 years after the bombing, and has since declined steadily. However, this has not been true of solid cancer. Radiation-induced solid cancer begins to appear at later ages than such cancer is normally prone to develop, and continues to increase proportionally with the increase in mortality or incidence in the control group as it ages. Survivors who were exposed in the first or second decade of life have just entered the cancer-prone age and have so far exhibited a high relative risk in association with radiation dose. Whether the elevated risk will continue or will fail with time is not yet clear. It is important to continue long-term follow-up of this cohort to document the changes with time since exposure. Beyond cancer risk, increased risk of non-cancer mortality is also suggested, although it is not conclusive.",

In rich medium, Whi5, Mbp1, and Swi6 concentrations were independent of cell size, whereas Swi4 concentration doubled in G1 phase, leading to a size-dependent decrease in the Whi5/Swi4 ratio. In small cells, SBF and MBF copy numbers were insufficient to saturate target G1/S promoters, but this restriction diminished as cells grew in size. In poor medium, SBF and MBF subunits, as well as Cln1, were elevated, consistent with a smaller cell size at Start. A mathematical model constrained by sN&amp;B data suggested that size- and nutrient-dependent occupancy of G1/S promoters by SBF/MBF helps set the cell size threshold for Start activation.",

We have now found that Skn7 associates with Mbp1, the DNA-binding component of the G1-S transcription factor DSC1/MBF. SKN7 and MBP1 show several genetic interactions. Skn7 overexpression is lethal and is suppressed by a mutation in MBP1. Similarly, high overexpression of Mbp1 is lethal and can be suppressed by skn7 mutations. SKN7 is also required for MBP1 function in a mutant compromised for G1-specific transcription. Gel-retardation assays indicate that Skn7 is not an integral part of MBF. However, a physical interaction between Skn7 and Mbp1 was detected using two-hybrid assays and GST pulldowns. Thus, Skn7 and Mbp1 seem to form a transcription factor independent of MBF. Genetic data suggest that this new transcription factor could be involved in the bud-emergence process.",

In the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, G(1)/S regulation is not clear. To gain more insight into the G(1)/S circuitry, we characterized Swi6p, Swi4p and Mbp1p, the closest orthologues of SBF (Swi6p and Swi4p) and MBF (Swi6p and Mbp1p) components in S. cerevisiae. The mbp1\u0394/\u0394 cells showed minor growth defects, whereas swi4\u0394/\u0394 and swi6\u0394/\u0394 yeast cells dramatically increased in size, suggesting a G(1) phase delay. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of transcription profiles revealed that genes associated with G(1)/S phase were significantly enriched in cells lacking Swi4p and Swi6p. These expression patterns suggested that Swi4p and Swi6p have repressing as well as activating activity. Intriguingly, swi4\u0394/\u0394 swi6\u0394/\u0394 and swi4\u0394/\u0394 mbp1\u0394/\u0394 strains were viable, in contrast to the situation in S. cerevisiae, and showed pleiotropic phenotypes that included multibudded yeast, pseudohyphae, and intriguingly, true hyphae. Consistently, GSEA identified strong enrichment of genes that are normally modulated during C. albicans-host cell interactions. Since Swi4p and Swi6p influence G(1) phase progression and SBF binding sites are lacking in the C. albicans genome, these factors may contribute to MBF activity. Overall, the data suggest that the putative G(1)/S regulatory machinery of C. albicans contains novel features and underscore the existence of a relationship between G(1) phase and morphogenetic switching, including hyphal development, in the pathogen.",

MBF and SBF consist of a common component, Swi6, and a DNA-specific binding protein, Mbp1 and Swi4, respectively. Transcriptional repressors bind to and regulate the activity of both transcription factors. Whi5 binds to SBF and represses its activity at the beginning of the G1 phase to prevent early activation. Nrm1 binds to MBF to repress transcription as cells progress through S phase. Here, we describe a protein motif, the GTB motif (for G1/S transcription factor binding), in Nrm1 and Whi5 that is required to bind to the transcription factors. We also identify a region of the carboxy terminus of Swi6 that is required for Nrm1 and Whi5 binding to their target transcription factors and show that mutation of this region overrides the repression of MBF- and SBF-regulated genes by Nrm1 and Whi5.

How DNA binding domains and cis-regulatory DNA binding sequences have co-evolved to allow the expansion of transcriptional networks and how this contributes to cellular fitness remains unclear. Here we experimentally explore how the complex G1/S transcriptional network evolved in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by examining different chimeric transcription factor (TF) complexes. Over 200 G1/S genes are regulated by either one of the two TF complexes, SBF and MBF, which bind to specific DNA binding sequences, SCB and MCB, respectively. The difference in size and complexity of the G1/S transcriptional network across yeast species makes it well suited to investigate how TF paralogs (SBF and MBF) and DNA binding sequences (SCB and MCB) co-evolved after gene duplication to rewire and expand the network of G1/S target genes. Our data suggests that whilst SBF is the likely ancestral regulatory complex, the ancestral DNA binding element is more MCB-like. G1/S network expansion took place by both cis- and trans- co-evolutionary changes in closely related but distinct regulatory sequences. Replacement of the endogenous SBF DNA-binding domain (DBD) with that from more distantly related fungi leads to a contraction of the SBF-regulated G1/S network in budding yeast, which also correlates with increased defects in cell growth, cell size, and proliferation.",

There are four main classes of HH, as well as five individual molecular subtypes, caused by mutations in five genes, and the approaches implemented in the discovery of each HH type have specific histories and unique aspects.

This autosomal recessive disease typically manifests later in women than men. Although it is commonly stated that pregnancy is, with menses, one of the factors that offsets iron accumulation in women, no epidemiological study has yet supported this hypothesis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of pregnancy on expression of the predominant HFE p.[Cys282Tyr];[Cys282Tyr] genotype. One hundred and forty p.Cys282Tyr homozygous women enrolled in a phlebotomy program between 2004 and 2011 at a blood centre in western Brittany (France) were included in the study. After checking whether the disease expression was delayed in women than in men in our study, the association between pregnancy and iron overload was assessed using multivariable regression analysis. Our study confirms that women with HFE hemochromatosis were diagnosed later than men cared for during the same period (52.6 vs. 47.4 y., P &lt; 0.001). Compared to no pregnancy, having at least one pregnancy was not associated with lower iron markers. In contrast, the amount of iron removed by phlebotomies appeared significantly higher in women who had at least one pregnancy (e<sup>\u03b2</sup> = 1.50, P = 0.047). This relationship disappeared after adjustment for confounding factors (e<sup>\u03b2</sup> = 1.35, P = 0.088). Our study shows that pregnancy status has no impact on iron markers level, and is not in favour of pregnancy being a protective factor in progressive iron accumulation. Our results are consistent with recent experimental data suggesting that the difference in disease expression observed between men and women may be explained by other factors such as hormones.",

Classic HH type 1, which is common in Caucasians, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of HFE. Severe types of HH are caused by either bi-allelic mutations of HFE2 that encodes hemojuvelin (type 2A) or HAMP that encodes hepcidin (type 2B). HH type 3, which is of intermediate severity, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of TFR2 that encodes transferrin receptor 2. Mutations of SLC40A1 that encodes ferroportin, the only cellular iron exporter, causes either HH type 4A (loss-of-function mutations) or HH type 4B (gain-of-function mutations). Studies on these gene products uncovered a part of the mechanisms of the systemic iron regulation; HFE, hemojuvelin, and TFR2 are involved in iron sensing and stimulating hepcidin expression, and hepcidin downregulates the expression of ferroportin of the target cells. Phlebotomy is the standard treatment for HH, and early initiation of the treatment is essential for preventing irreversible organ damage. However, because of the rarity and difficulty in making the genetic diagnosis, a large proportion of patients with non-HFE HH might have been undiagnosed; therefore, awareness of this disorder is important.",

Treatment of HH involves regular phlebotomy to reduce the systemic iron burden. In many countries-including the United States-numerous blood centers do not accept donated blood obtained from HH patients during therapeutic phlebotomy and there are inconsistent positions regarding this globally. This refusal of blood is borne out of a few concerns. First, there is a theoretical increase in the infectious risk of these blood products, particularly by siderophilic organisms such as Yersinia enterocolitica. Second, given the increased incidence of hepatitis C infection from nonvoluntary donors in the 1970s, there is a concern that blood units from HH donors may harbor additional risk given the nonvoluntary nature of their presentation. In this review, we examine the existing biological and clinical data concerning infectious risk and summarize clinical experience from centers allowing HH donors, and demonstrate that blood from HH patients is safe and should be allowed into the donor pool. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence to exclude this population from serving as blood donors. (Hepatology 2018;67:1150-1157).",

Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression.

Because <i>hof1\u2206</i> and <i>cyk3\u2206</i> single mutants have relatively mild defects but <i>hof1\u2206 cyk3\u2206</i> double mutants are nearly dead, it has been hypothesized that these proteins contribute to parallel pathways. However, there is also evidence that they interact physically. In this study, we examined this interaction and its functional significance in detail. Our data indicate that the interaction 1) is mediated by a direct binding of the Hof1 SH3 domain to a proline-rich motif in Cyk3; 2) occurs specifically at the time of cytokinesis but is independent of the (hyper)phosphorylation of both proteins that occurs at about the same time; 3) is dispensable for the normal localization of both proteins; 4) is essential for normal primary-septum formation and a normal rate of cleavage-furrow ingression; and 5) becomes critical for growth when either Inn1 or the type II myosin Myo1 (a key component of the contractile actomyosin ring) is absent. The similarity in phenotype between <i>cyk3\u2206</i> mutants and mutants specifically lacking the Hof1-Cyk3 interaction suggests that the interaction is particularly important for Cyk3 function, but it may be important for Hof1 function as well.",

In this paper, we propose fine-grained parallelized SW algorithms using affine gap penalty and implement a parallel computing structures to accelerating the SW with backtracking on FPGA platform. We analysis the dynamic parallel computing features of anti-diagonal elements and storage expansion problem resulting from backtracking stage, and propose a series of optimization strategies to eliminate data dependency, reduce storage requirements, and overlap memory access latency. Our implementation is capable of supporting multi-type, large-scale biological sequence alignment applications. We obtain a speedup between 3.6 and 25.2 over the typical SW algorithm running on a general-purpose computer configured with an Intel Core i5 3.2 GHz CPU. Moreover, our work is superior to other FPGA implementations in both array size and clock frequency, and the experiment results show that it can get a performance closed to that of the latest GPU implementation, but the power consumption is only about 26% of that of the GPU platforms.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26445214": " The Smith-Waterman algorithm is known to be a more sensitive approach than heuristic algorithms for local sequence alignment algorithms. Despite its sensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the Smith-Waterman algorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons of base sequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees. The aim of this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band optimization) compared with that achieved using a previous method that performs intrapair block pruning on graphics processing units (GPUs). We present an interpair optimization method for the Smith-Waterman algorithm with the aim of accelerating the all-pairs comparison of base sequences. Given the results of the pairs of sequences, our method realizes efficient block pruning by computing a lower bound for other pairs that have not yet been processed. This lower bound is further used for band optimization. We integrated our interpair optimization method into SW#, a previous GPU-based implementation that employs variants of a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm and a banded Myers-Miller algorithm. Evaluation using the six genomes of Bacillus anthracis shows that our method pruned 88% of the matrix cells on a single GPU and 73% of the matrix cells on two GPUs. For the genomes of the human chromosome 21, the alignment performance reached 202 giga-cell updates per second (GCUPS) on two Tesla K40 GPUs. Efficient interpair pruning and band optimization makes it possible to complete the all-pairs comparisons of the sequences of the same species 1.2 times faster than the intrapair pruning method. This acceleration was achieved at the first phase of SW#, where our method significantly improved the initial lower bound. However, our interpair optimization was not effective for the comparison of the sequences of different species such as comparing human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Consequently, our method is useful in accelerating the applications that require optimal local alignments scores for the same species.

This ingenious dynamic programming approach was designed to reveal the highly conserved fragments by discarding poorly conserved initial and terminal segments. However, the existing notion of local similarity has a serious flaw: it does not discard poorly conserved intermediate segments. The Smith-Waterman algorithm finds the local alignment with maximal score but it is unable to find local alignment with maximum degree of similarity (e.g. maximal percent of matches). Moreover, there is still no efficient algorithm that answers the following natural question: do two sequences share a (sufficiently long) fragment with more than 70% of similarity? As a result, the local alignment sometimes produces a mosaic of well-conserved fragments artificially connected by poorly-conserved or even unrelated fragments. This may lead to problems in comparison of long genomic sequences and comparative gene prediction as recently pointed out by Zhang et al. (Bioinformatics, 15, 1012-1019, 1999). In this paper we propose a new sequence comparison algorithm (normalized local alignment ) that reports the regions with maximum degree of similarity. The algorithm is based on fractional programming and its running time is O(n2log n). In practice, normalized local alignment is only 3-5 times slower than the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm.",

The sequences of two foot-printed regions (sites I and IV) are A-T rich and generate a highly retarded complex on gel shift analysis with nuclear extract from human erythroleukemia (K562) cells. We have purified a 98-kD protein that reproduces this gel shift. Tryptic cleavage and peptide sequence analysis demonstrated that the 98-kD protein is identical to a recently cloned protein, special A-T-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), that binds selectively to nuclear matrix/scaffold-associated regions of DNA (MARs/SARs). We have shown by functional analysis that the 3' A gamma regulatory element associates with the nuclear matrix. SATB1 mRNA was identified in K562 cells, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated its transcript in several other hematopoietic lines. Antisera to SATB1 caused ablation of the gel shift complex generated by both the crude nuclear extract and the purified 98-kD protein with the site I oligonucleotide. Furthermore, oligonucleotides that bind SATB1 inhibited formation of the site I gel shift complex when added as excess unlabeled competitor. An immunoblot analysis of the site I gel shift complex documented the presence of SATB1. Binding of SATB1 to two sites within the 3' A gamma regulatory element and its MAR/SAR activity suggests that this element may influence gene expression through interaction with the nuclear matrix.",

Such regions confer a high propensity for stable base unpairing. Using an in vivo cross-linking strategy, specialized genomic sequences (0.1-1. 1 kbp) that bind to SATB1 in human lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat cells were individually isolated and characterized. All in vivo SATB1-binding sequences examined contained typical ATC sequence contexts, with some exhibiting homology to autonomously replicating sequences from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that function as replication origins in yeast cells. In addition, LINE 1 elements, satellite 2 sequences, and CpG island-containing DNA were identified. To examine the higher-order packaging of these in vivo SATB1-binding sequences, high-resolution in situ fluorescence hybridization was performed with both nuclear \"halos\" with distended loops and the nuclear matrix after the majority of DNA had been removed by nuclease digestion. In vivo SATB1-binding sequences hybridized to genomic DNA as single spots within the residual nucleus circumscribed by the halo of DNA and remained as single spots in the nuclear matrix, indicating that these sequences are localized at the base of chromatin loops. In human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells that do not express SATB1, at least one such sequence was found not anchored onto the nuclear matrix. These findings provide the first evidence that a cell type-specific factor such as SATB1 binds to the base of chromatin loops in vivo and suggests that a specific chromatin loop domain structure is involved in T cell-specific gene regulation.",

We analyzed DNA-protein interactions in the MBR, as these may play some role in targeting the translocation to this region. An 87-bp segment (87MBR) immediately 3' to breakpoint cluster 3 was essential for DNA-protein interaction monitored with mobility shift assays. We further delineated a core binding region within 87MBR: a 33-bp, very AT-rich sequence highly conserved between the human and mouse BCL2 gene (37MBR). We have purified and identified one of the core factors as the matrix attachment region (MAR) binding protein, SATB1, which is known to bind to AT-rich sequences with a high propensity to unwind. Additional factors in nuclear extracts, which we have not yet characterized further, increased SATB1 affinity for the 37MBR target four- to fivefold. Specific binding activity within 37MBR displayed cell cycle regulation in Jurkat T cells, while levels of SATB1 remained constant throughout the cell cycle. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo binding of SATB1 to the MBR, strongly suggesting the BCL2 major breakpoint region is a MAR. We discuss the potential consequences of our observations for both MBR fragility and regulatory function.",

These proteins, working in concert, enhanced SUMO conjugation to lysine-744 of SATB1. Overexpression of SUMO or PIAS in Jurkat cells, which express high levels of endogenous SATB1, exhibited enhanced caspase cleavage of this MAR-associating protein. Sumoylation-deficient SATB1 (SATB1(K744R)) failed to display the characteristic caspase cleavage pattern; however, fusion of SUMO in-frame to SATB1(K744R) restored cleavage. A SUMO-independent interaction of inactive caspase-6 and SATB1 was noted. A subset of total cellular SATB1 localized into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies where enhanced SATB1 cleavage was detected subsequent to caspase activation. These results reveal a novel sumoylation-directed caspase cleavage of this key regulatory molecule.

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect SATB1 and LMP-1 protein in clinical samples, and the association of SATB1 protein expression with patient clinicopathological characteristics and LMP-1 expression were analyzed. SATB1 expression profiles were evaluated in well-differentiated NPC cell line CNE1, poorly-differentiated CNE2Z, undifferentiated C666-1 and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelia NP-69 cells using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and fluorescent staining. After inhibition the SATB1 expression by using SATB1 specific small interfering RNA in these cell lines, the change of cell proliferation was investigated by western blotting analysis of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression and CCK-8 assay, and the cell migration was assessed by Transwell migration assay. Finally, the expressions of SATB1 and PCNA were examined in CNE1 cells that forced LMP-1 expression by fluorescent staining and RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SATB1 protein expression was elevated in NPC tissues compared to benign nasopharyngeal tissues (P = 0.005). Moreover, high levels of SATB1 protein expression were positively correlated with clinical stage (P = 0.025), the status of lymph node metastasis (N classification) (P = 0.018), distant metastasis (M classification) (P = 0.041) and LMP-1 expression status (r = 2.35, P &lt; 0.01) in NPC patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that an inverse relationship between SATB1 expression and NPC differentiation status, with SATB1 weakly expressed in NP-69 cells and CNE1 cells, and significant increasingly expressed in CNE-2Z and C666-1 cells. Targeted knockdown of SATB1 expression obviously attenuated the proliferation and migration of highly SATB1-expressing CNE2Z and C666-1 cells, but not NP-69 and CNE1 cells. Interestingly, forced LMP-1 expression in CNE1 cells led to a surprisingly increasing SATB1 expression and nuclear location, companying with an up-regulated PCNA expression.

However, more detailed studies on the SATB1 functions in CRC are warranted. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown. Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1 knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable knockdown cells.

DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases carry both a glycosylase activity that removes the faulty base and an apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase activity that introduces a single-strand DNA incision. In particular, the CUT domains within the CUX1 and CUX2 proteins were recently shown to interact with the 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) DNA glycosylase and stimulate its enzymatic activities. SATB1, which contains two CUT domains, was originally characterized as a T cell-specific genome organizer whose aberrant overexpression in breast cancer can promote tumor progression. Here we investigated the involvement of SATB1 in DNA repair. SATB1 knockdown caused a delay in DNA repair following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, an increase in OGG1-sensitive oxidized bases within genomic DNA, and a decrease in 8-oxoG cleavage activity in cell extracts. In parallel, we observed an increase in phospho-CHK1 and \u03b3-H2AX levels and a decrease in DNA synthesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of SATB1 accelerated DNA repair and reduced the levels of oxidized bases in genomic DNA. Moreover, an enhanced GFP-SATB1 fusion protein was rapidly recruited to laser microirradiation-induced DNA damage. Using purified proteins, we showed that SATB1 interacts directly with OGG1, increases its binding to 8-oxoG-containing DNA, promotes Schiff base formation, and stimulates its glycosylase and apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase enzymatic activities. Structure/function analysis demonstrated that CUT domains, but not the homeodomain, are responsible for the stimulation of OGG1.

However, the optimal selection of eligible patients who will benefit most, is far from being clear and the best biomarker has not yet been established. PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC. Most recently, two phase III first-line NSCLC studies have provided evidence that tumour mutational burden (TMB) correlates with the clinical response to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (CheckMate-227; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02477826\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02477826</a>), whereas atezolizumab response was correlated with T effector gene signature expression (IMPower 150; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02366143\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02366143</a>). Both studies demonstrated a significant primary endpoint [progression-free survival (PFS)] benefit in the TMB group and in the group of patients expressing a T effector cell signature, respectively. However, PFS benefit in both studies was seen regardless of the PD-L1 status of all patients suggesting that TMB and T effector cell signatures may be more robust to predict clinical response following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The role of putative novel predictive biomarkers evaluated in the CheckMate-227 and the IMPower 150 trials may, if confirmed in future prospective studies, offer a new perspective for predicting immunotherapy treatment outcomes of NSCLC patients in the near future.",

In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear. We hypothesized that a rare loss-of-function mutation in <i>SERPINE1</i> (c.699_700dupTA), which encodes PAI-1, could play a role in longevity and metabolism in humans. We studied 177 members of the Berne Amish community, which included 43 carriers of the null <i>SERPINE1</i> mutation. Heterozygosity was associated with significantly longer leukocyte telomere length, lower fasting insulin levels, and lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus. In the extended Amish kindred, carriers of the null SERPINE1 allele had a longer life span. Our study indicates a causal effect of PAI-1 on human longevity, which may be mediated by alterations in metabolism. Our findings demonstrate the utility of studying loss-of-function mutations in populations with geographic and genetic isolation and shed light on a novel therapeutic target for aging.",

Using data from the population-based cardiovascular health study (CHS) cohort, we examined the associations between promoter polymorphisms of several inflammation and thrombosis genes with longevity. We ascertained genotypes for interleukin (IL)-6 -174 G/C, beta-fibrinogen -455 G/A, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 -675 4G/5G, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) -438 G/A in 2224 men and women &gt; or = 65 years old at baseline. During 10 years of follow-up, men with the TAFI -438 A/A genotype had decreased mortality due to all causes, and lived, on average, 0.9 more years of life, or 1.1 more years of healthy life, than men with the -438 G allele. The effects of TAFI -438 G/A in women were smaller and not statistically significant. PAI-1 4G/4G genotype appeared to be associated with lower non-cardiovascular mortality in men, but with greater cardiovascular mortality in women.

We investigated the restriction fragment length polymorphism G/A-455 located in the promoter of the beta-fibrinogen gene, the guanine insertion/deletion polymorphism 4G/5G in the promoter of the PAI-1 gene, and the R353Q substitution polymorphism in exon 8 of the factor VII gene. Alleles and genotypes associated with elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen and factor VII were found with similar frequencies in centenarians and in the comparison group. However, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with successful aging.",

We investigated the effects of these medications on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) to determine their relative potential to reduce cardiovascular risk independent of their antihyperglycemic actions. Ninety-two subjects with suboptimally controlled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] &gt;7.0%) were assigned to therapy with either rosiglitazone 4 mg once daily or metformin 850 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the change in hsCRP after 24 weeks. The change in CIMT was prespecified as a secondary end point. Metformin and rosiglitazone treatment led to similar significant improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c -1.08% in the rosiglitazone group and -1.18% in the metformin group, P = nonsignificant). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels decreased by an average of 68% in the rosiglitazone group (5.99 +/- 0.88 to 1.91 +/- 0.28 mg/L, P &lt; .001), compared with a nonsignificant 4% reduction in hsCRP with metformin (5.69 +/- 0.83 to 5.46 +/- 0.92 mg/L; P = nonsignificant).

Using ApoE\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6J mice, we found that metformin attenuates atherosclerosis and vascular senescence in mice fed a high\u2010fat diet and prevents the upregulation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor by a high\u2010fat diet in the aortas of mice. Thus, considering the known deleterious effects of angiotensin II mediated by angiotensin II type 1 receptor, the vascular benefits of metformin may be mediated, at least in part, by angiotensin II type 1 receptor downregulation. Moreover, we found that metformin can cause weight loss without hypoglycemia. We also found that metformin increases the antioxidant superoxide dismutase\u20101.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and, subsequently, the effect of metformin in regressing angiotensin II (Ang-II)-mediated atheromatous plaque formation in ApoE(-/-) mice. AMPK activity was dose and time dependently downregulated during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, which was accompanied by an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Of note, AMPK activators metformin and AICAR significantly attenuated PMA-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine production. However, inhibition of AMPK activity alone by compound C was ineffective in promoting monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in the absence of PMA. On the other hand, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity inhibited PMA-induced inflammation but not differentiation, suggesting that inflammation and differentiation are independent events. In contrast, inhibition of STAT3 activity inhibited both inflammation and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. By decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation, metformin and AICAR through increased AMPK activation caused inhibition of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Metformin attenuated Ang-II-induced atheromatous plaque formation and aortic aneurysm in ApoE(-/-) mice partly by reducing monocyte infiltration. We conclude that the AMPK-STAT3 axis plays a pivotal role in regulating monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and that by decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation through increased AMPK activity, AMPK activators inhibit monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation.",

In rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet, we evaluated the effects of the combination therapy on atherosclerotic plaques, lipid profiles, blood glucose levels, liver and kidney functions. Effects of combination therapy on cholesterol efflux and the expression of related transporters were studied in vitro. Our results showed that the combination therapy induced a more significant decrease in atherosclerotic lesion area than atorvastatin without additional lipid-lowering effect. The combination therapy significantly increased the percentage of large high-density lipoprotein subfraction. The intravenous glucose tolerance test showed that atorvastatin-treated rabbits had an increased area under the curve for time-dependent glucose levels after a bolus injection of glucose, which was completely reversed by metformin treatment. In cultured macrophages, co-treatment with metformin and atorvastatin promoted cholesterol efflux and up-regulated expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1.

How metformin protects against diabetes-related cardiovascular diseases remains poorly understood. Here, we show that metformin abated the progression of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis by inhibiting mitochondrial fission in endothelial cells. Metformin treatments markedly reduced mitochondrial fragmentation, mitigated mitochondrial-derived superoxide release, improved endothelial-dependent vasodilation, inhibited vascular inflammation, and suppressed atherosclerotic lesions in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In high glucose-exposed endothelial cells, metformin treatment and adenoviral overexpression of constitutively active AMPK downregulated mitochondrial superoxide, lowered levels of dynamin-related protein (Drp1) and its translocation into mitochondria, and prevented mitochondrial fragmentation. In contrast, AMPK-\u03b12 deficiency abolished the effects of metformin on Drp1 expression, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis in diabetic ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>/AMPK-\u03b12<sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating that metformin exerts an antiatherosclerotic action in vivo via the AMPK-mediated blockage of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Consistently, mitochondrial division inhibitor 1, a potent and selective Drp1 inhibitor, reduced mitochondrial fragmentation, attenuated oxidative stress, ameliorated endothelial dysfunction, inhibited inflammation, and suppressed atherosclerosis in diabetic mice. These findings show that metformin attenuated the development of atherosclerosis by reducing Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in an AMPK-dependent manner. Suppression of mitochondrial fission may be a therapeutic approach for treating macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29499335": "Lipids are responsible for the atheromatous plaque formation during atherosclerosis by their deposition in the subendothelial intima of the aorta, leading to infarction. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), regulating cholesterol homeostasis, is suggested to play a pivotal role during the early incidence of atherosclerosis through dysregulation of lipid homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that oxidative stress stimulates SREBP2-mediated cholesterol uptake via low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), rather than cholesterol synthesis, in mouse vascular aortic smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) and THP-1 monocytes. The enhancement of mature form of SREBP2 (SREBP2-M) during oxidative stress was associated with the inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. In contrast, inhibition of either SREBP2 by fatostatin or LDLR by siLDLR resulted in decreased cholesterol levels during oxidative stress. Thereby confirming the role of SREBP2 in cholesterol regulation via LDLR. Metformin-mediated activation of AMPK was able to significantly abrogate cholesterol uptake by inhibiting SREBP2-M. Interestingly, although metformin administration attenuated angiotensin (Ang)-II-impaired lipid homeostasis in both aorta and liver tissues of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the results indicate that SREBP2 through LDLR regulates lipid homeostasis in aorta but not in liver tissue. Taken together, AMPK activation inhibits oxidative stress-mediated SREBP2-dependent cholesterol uptake, and moreover, metformin-induced prevention of atheromatic events are in part due to its ability to regulate the SREBP2-LDLR axis.",

After 2 weeks of acclimatization, the rabbits in the AS and Met groups were given a placebo and metformin, respectively, daily by gavage for 10 weeks. Plasma lipids and inflammatory cytokines were measured. The aorta was isolated for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with metformin, and monocyte adhesion and adhesion molecule expression were measured. Metformin reduced plasma inflammatory cytokine levels but did not alter lipid content. Compared with that in the AS group, the atherosclerosis burden in the Met group was significantly decreased. The lesional macrophage content was reduced, but the lesional collagen content was not affected in the metformin-treated rabbits, compared with the corresponding levels in the non-treated controls. Furthermore, the aortic mRNA expression levels of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines in the Met group were also significantly reduced compared with those in the AS group. Metformin treatment reduced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs) and adhesion molecule expression, and inhibited rabbit monocyte differentiation into macrophages and the macrophage inflammatory response.

Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus (InGaAIP) laser operated at 660 nm in preventing radiodermatitis in women undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. This is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. A total of 52 patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer (stages I to III) will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group to receive laser therapy (n = 26) or a control group to receive a placebo (n = 26). The laser or placebo will be applied five days a week, immediately before each radiotherapy session. Skin reactions will then be graded weekly by a nurse, a radiotherapist, and an oncologist (all of whom will be blinded) using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) developed by the National Cancer Institute and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Patients will also answer a modified visual analogue scale for pain (a self-evaluation questionnaire). Primary and secondary outcomes will be the prevention of radiodermatitis and pain secondary to radiodermatitis, respectively. The ideal tool for preventing radiodermatitis is an agent that mediates DNA repair or promotes cell proliferation. Application of a low-power laser has been shown to promote tissue repair by reducing inflammation and inducing collagen synthesis. Moreover, this treatment approach has not been associated with adverse events and is cost-effective. Thus, the results of this ongoing trial may establish whether use of a low-power laser represents an ideal treatment option for the prevention of radiodermatitis.

Members of the E26 transformation specific (Ets) family of transcription factors, in particular, are potent regulators of these CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cell processes. In this review, we summarize and discuss the functions and underlying mechanisms of the Ets family members that have been characterized as involved in these processes. Ongoing research of these factors is expected to identify practical applications for the Ets family members as novel therapeutic targets for inflammation-related diseases.",

At each bifurcation, precursors adopt one fate and inactivate the alternative fate either stochastically or in response to extrinsic stimuli and stably maintain the selected fates. Studying of these processes would contribute to better understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary cell fate decision processes of T cells.",

These precursors have unique, clonally distributed T-cell receptors with unpredictable specificity for the self-MHC molecules involved in this differentiation process. However, the mature T cells that emerge express only the CD4 (MHC class II-binding) or CD8 (MHC class I-binding) co-receptor that complements the MHC class-specificity of the T-cell receptor. How this matching of co-receptor-defined lineage and T-cell-receptor specificity is achieved remains unknown, as does whether signalling by the T-cell receptors, co-receptors and/or general cell-fate regulators such as Notch-1 contributes to initial lineage choice, to subsequent differentiation processes or to both. Here we show that the CD4 versus CD8 lineage fate of immature thymocytes is controlled by the co-receptor-influenced duration of initial T-cell receptor-dependent signalling. Notch-1 does not appear to be essential for this fate determination, but it is selectively required for CD8+ T-cell maturation after commitment directed by T-cell receptors. This indicates that the signals constraining CD4 versus CD8 lineage decisions are distinct from those that support subsequent differentiation events such as silencing of co-receptor loci.",

Most helper T cells express CD4, which binds to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, and most cytotoxic T cells express CD8, which binds to class I MHC proteins. In the thymus, mature CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells expressing alpha beta T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) develop from immature thymocytes through CD4+CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ intermediates. Experiments using mice transgenic for alpha beta TCR suggest that the specificity of the TCR determines the CD4/CD8 phenotype of mature T cells. These results, however, do not indicate how a T cell differentiates into the CD4 or CD8 lineage. Here we show that the CD4 transmembrane region and/or cytoplasmic tail mediates the delivery of a specific signal that directs differentiation of T cells to a CD4 lineage. We generated transgenic mice expressing a hybrid molecule composed of the CD8 alpha extracellular domains linked to the CD4 transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. We predicted that this hybrid molecule would bind to class I MHC proteins through the extracellular domains but deliver the intracellular signals characteristic of CD4. By crossing our transgenic mice with mice expressing a transgenic alpha beta TCR specific for a particular antigen plus class I MHC protein, we were able to express the hybrid molecule in developing thymocytes expressing the class I MHC-restricted TCR. Our results show that the signal transduced by the hybrid molecule results in the differentiation of immature thymocytes expressing a class I-restricted TCR into mature T cells expressing CD4.",

CD8 and CD4 are required for T cell interactions with class I or class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. In the thymus, immature CD8(-4)-TCR- cells differentiate, possibly via a short stage of CD8+4- thymocytes, into CD8+4+ TCR+ T cells and mature further into the main T cell populations, the CD8+4- TCR+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the CD4+8- TCR+ T helper cells. In order to analyse the differentiation steps involving CD8, we generated transgenic mice expressing mu heavy chain genes from an anti-Lyt2.2 hybridoma. Transgenic lines expressing either the complete (mu sm) or only the secreted mu protein (mu s) suffer from a severe depletion of their CD8+4+ thymocytes affecting also the mature CD8+4- and CD4+8- populations. The depletion is correlated to the expression of transgenic mu-chain proteins within thymocytes. This intrathymocyte expression of the mu chain prevents CD8-4- thymocytes from further differentiation, most probably via intracellular interactions between mu heavy chain and CD8 proteins. These results show that CD8 plays an important role during thymocyte maturation.",

In the mammalian thymus, CD4 helper T cells and CD8 cytotoxic T cells arise from a common precursor that expresses both CD4 and CD8. The choice between the CD4 and CD8 lineage is linked to the specificity of the T-cell antigen receptor expressed by a thymocyte, but whether lineage commitment is stochastic or instructed has not been definitively resolved. We present evidence that expression of a constitutive CD8 transgene during thymic selection permits development of mature CD4 cells bearing the class I-restricted F5 T-cell antigen receptor.

It has been established that H. pylori play an important role in pathogenesis of gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Pathogenic features of this bacterium are mainly attributes to the existence of pathogenic islands (PAI) genes. The most known genes in these islands are cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene (VacA). Most studies demonstrated various frequency of CagA and VacA in patient with peptic ulcer or gastritis in different countries. This variation in CagA and VacA frequency may be due to the capability of this bacterium to be genetically versatile and can alter the expression of these genes with geographic diversity. Although H. pylori infection is not usually associated with any clinical symptoms, but sometimes leads to inflammation in gastrointestinal system and resulted in peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. In this regard, this review will illustrate the importance of Helicobacter pylori in pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disorders with focusing on CagA and VacA virulence factors.",

Spiral-shaped H. pylori undergo morphologic conversion to a viable but not culturable coccoid form when they transit from the microaerobic stomach into the anaerobic intestinal tract. However, little is known about the morphological and pathogenic characteristics of H. pylori under prolonged anaerobic conditions. In this study, scanning electron microscopy was used to document anaerobiosis-induced morphological changes of H. pylori, from helical to coccoid to a newly defined fragmented form. Western blot analysis indicated that all three forms express certain pathogenic proteins, including the bacterial cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), components of the cag-Type IV secretion system (TFSS), the blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA, and UreA (an apoenzyme of urease), almost equally. Similar urease activities were also detected in all three forms of H. pylori. However, in contrast to the helical form, bacterial motility and TFSS activity were found to have been abrogated in the anaerobiosis-induced coccoid and fragmented forms of H. pylori. Notably, it was demonstrated that some of the anaerobiosis-induced fragmented state cells could be converted to proliferation-competent helical bacteria in vitro. These results indicate that prolonged exposure to the anaerobic intestine may not eliminate the potential for H. pylori to revert to the helical pathogenic state.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29764950": "Strains of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> that cause ulcer or gastric cancer typically express a type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the <i>cag</i> pathogenicity island (<i>cag</i>PAI). CagY is an ortholog of VirB10 that, unlike other VirB10 orthologs, has a large middle repeat region (MRR) with extensive repetitive sequence motifs, which undergo CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent recombination during infection of mice. Recombination in the CagY MRR reduces T4SS function, diminishes the host inflammatory response, and enables the bacteria to colonize at a higher density. Since CagY is known to bind human \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin, we tested the hypothesis that recombination in the CagY MRR regulates T4SS function by modulating binding to \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin. Using a cell-free microfluidic assay, we found that <i>H. pylori</i> binding to \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin under shear flow is dependent on the CagY MRR, but independent of the presence of the T4SS pili, which are only formed when <i>H. pylori</i> is in contact with host cells. Similarly, expression of CagY in the absence of other T4SS genes was necessary and sufficient for whole bacterial cell binding to \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin. Bacteria with variant <i>cagY</i> alleles that reduced T4SS function showed comparable reduction in binding to \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin, although CagY was still expressed on the bacterial surface. We speculate that <i>cagY-</i>dependent modulation of <i>H. pylori</i> T4SS function is mediated by alterations in binding to \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin, which in turn regulates the host inflammatory response so as to maximize persistent infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with <i>H. pylori</i> can cause peptic ulcers and is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The major <i>H. pylori</i> virulence factor that determines whether infection causes disease or asymptomatic colonization is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a sort of molecular syringe that injects bacterial products into gastric epithelial cells and alters host cell physiology. We previously showed that recombination in CagY, an essential T4SS component, modulates the function of the T4SS. Here we found that these recombination events produce parallel changes in specific binding to \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin, a host cell receptor that is essential for T4SS-dependent translocation of bacterial effectors. We propose that CagY-dependent binding to \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin acts like a molecular rheostat that alters T4SS function and modulates the host immune response to promote persistent infection.",

The goals of this study were to investigate the frequency of cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori in Mexican patients with gastric pathologies and to assess the association of cagA EPIYA motif patterns with peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. A total of 499 patients were studied; of these, 402 had chronic gastritis, 77 had peptic ulcer, and 20 had gastric cancer. H. pylori DNA, cagA, and the EPIYA motifs were detected in total DNA from gastric biopsies by PCR. The type and number of EPIYA segments were determined by the electrophoretic patterns. To confirm the PCR results, 20 amplicons of the cagA 3' variable region were sequenced, and analyzed in silico, and the amino acid sequence was predicted with MEGA software, version 5. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated to determine the associations between the EPIYA motif type and gastric pathology and between the number of EPIYA-C segments and peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. H. pylori DNA was found in 287 (57.5%) of the 499 patients, and 214 (74%) of these patients were cagA-positive. The frequency of cagA-positive H. pylori was 74.6% (164/220) in chronic gastritis patients, 73.6% (39/53) in peptic ulcer patients, and 78.6% (11/14) in gastric cancer patients. The EPIYA-ABC pattern was more frequently observed in chronic gastritis patients (79.3%, 130/164), while the EPIYA-ABCC sequence was more frequently observed in peptic ulcer (64.1%, 25/39) and gastric cancer patients (54.5%, 6/11).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the H. pylori stool antigen test in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. Patients with bleeding and nonbleeding peptic ulcers underwent a rapid urease test, histology, bacterial culture and H. pylori stool antigen test. Positive H. pylori infection was defined as a positive culture or both a positive histology and a positive rapid urease test. Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was assessed with a commercial kit (Diagnostec H. pylori antigen EIA Kit, Hong Kong).

Its acquisition leads to a chronic, usually lifelong, inflammation of the gastric mucosa, which may gradually progress to atrophy (with intestinal metaplasia) in a significant proportion of infected individuals. This progression is probably multifactorial, being influenced by genetic or environmental factors in addition to H. pylori infection. The pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer is closely associated with H. pylori gastritis and its subsequent atrophic sequelae (atrophic gastritis). H. pylori-induced gastritis is an important risk factor in the multifactorial aetiology of these diseases. It causes a cascade of reactions that damage the gastric mucosa and epithelium in various ways. The specific mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Some are probably bacterium-related reactions, which are influenced by various virulence factors, and others are consequences of the mucosal inflammation and atrophy. The risk of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer in patients with H. pylori gastritis can be summarized as follows: i) the risk of both peptic ulcer and gastric cancer is low in individuals with a normal stomach; ii) the risk of peptic ulcer is approximately ten times higher and the risk of gastric cancer approximately twice as high in patients with non-atrophic H. pylori-positive gastritis as in those with a normal stomach; iii) these risks are further increased (twofold to threefold) when there is antral atrophy; whereas iv) in the presence of corpus atrophy the risk of gastric cancer remains high, but that of peptic ulcer decreases gradually to zero with increasing severity of corpus atrophy.",

Moreover, the juvenile form of HD, evoked by a higher number of CAG repeats, resembles a neurodevelopmental disorder and has recently been the focus of additional interest. Multiple lines of data, such as the developmental necessity of HTT, its role in the cell cycle and neurogenesis, and findings from pluripotent stem cells, suggest the existence of a neurodevelopmental component in HD pathogenesis.

We found that patient MSNs consistently exhibited mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates, mHTT-dependent DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and spontaneous degeneration in culture over time.

A CAG/CTG repeat expansion in the junctophilin-3 (JPH3) gene on chromosome 16q24.2 causes a Huntington disease-like phenotype (HDL2). All patients to date with HDL2 have some African ancestry. The present study aimed to characterize the genetic basis of the Huntington disease phenotype in South Africans and to investigate the possible origin of the JPH3 mutation. In a sample of unrelated South African individuals referred for diagnostic HD testing, 62% (106/171) of white patients compared to only 36% (47/130) of black patients had an expansion in HTT. However, 15% (20/130) of black South African patients and no white patients (0/171) had an expansion in JPH3, confirming the diagnosis of Huntington disease like 2 (HDL2). Individuals with HDL2 share many clinical features with individuals with HD and are clinically indistinguishable in many cases, although the average age of onset and diagnosis in HDL2 is 5 years later than HD and individual clinical features may be more prominent. HDL2 mutations contribute significantly to the HD phenotype in South Africans with African ancestry. JPH3 haplotype studies in 31 families, mainly from South Africa and North America, provide evidence for a founder mutation and support a common African origin for all HDL2 patients.

This expansion encodes a mutant protein whose abnormal function is traditionally associated with HD pathogenesis; however, recent evidence has also linked HD pathogenesis to RNA stable hairpins formed by the mutant HTT expansion. Here, we have shown that a locked nucleic acid-modified antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the CAG repeat (LNA-CTG) preferentially binds to mutant HTT without affecting HTT mRNA or protein levels. LNA-CTGs produced rapid and sustained improvement of motor deficits in an R6/2 mouse HD model that was paralleled by persistent binding of LNA-CTG to the expanded HTT exon 1 transgene. Motor improvement was accompanied by a pronounced recovery in the levels of several striatal neuronal markers severely impaired in R6/2 mice. Furthermore, in R6/2 mice, LNA-CTG blocked several pathogenic mechanisms caused by expanded CAG RNA, including small RNA toxicity and decreased Rn45s expression levels. These results suggest that LNA-CTGs promote neuroprotection by blocking the detrimental activity of CAG repeats within HTT mRNA. The present data emphasize the relevance of expanded CAG RNA to HD pathogenesis, indicate that inhibition of HTT expression is not required to reverse motor deficits, and further suggest a therapeutic potential for LNA-CTG in polyglutamine disorders.",

Huntington disease phenocopies accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching for a genetic cause.

Here, we provide evidence to support that the mutant HTT CAG repeats interfere with cell viability at the RNA level. In human neuronal cells, expanded HTT exon-1 mRNA with CAG repeat lengths above the threshold for complete penetrance (40 or greater) induced cell death and increased levels of small CAG-repeated RNAs (sCAGs), of \u224821 nucleotides in a Dicer-dependent manner. The severity of the toxic effect of HTT mRNA and sCAG generation correlated with CAG expansion length. Small RNAs obtained from cells expressing mutant HTT and from HD human brains significantly decreased neuronal viability, in an Ago2-dependent mechanism. In both cases, the use of anti-miRs specific for sCAGs efficiently blocked the toxic effect, supporting a key role of sCAGs in HTT-mediated toxicity. Luciferase-reporter assays showed that expanded HTT silences the expression of CTG-containing genes that are down-regulated in HD. These results suggest a possible link between HD and sCAG expression with an aberrant activation of the siRNA/miRNA gene silencing machinery, which may trigger a detrimental response.

Therefore, considerable effort has been dedicated to the development of therapeutic strategies that significantly reduce the expression of the mutant HTT protein. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeted to the CAG repeat region of HTT transcripts have been of particular interest due to their potential capacity to discriminate between normal and mutant HTT transcripts. Here, we focus on phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), ASOs that are especially stable, highly soluble and non-toxic. We designed three PMOs to selectively target expanded CAG repeat tracts (CTG22, CTG25 and CTG28), and two PMOs to selectively target sequences flanking the HTT CAG repeat (HTTex1a and HTTex1b). In HD patient-derived fibroblasts with expanded alleles containing 44, 77 or 109 CAG repeats, HTTex1a and HTTex1b were effective in suppressing the expression of mutant and non-mutant transcripts. CTGn PMOs also suppressed HTT expression, with the extent of suppression and the specificity for mutant transcripts dependent on the length of the targeted CAG repeat and on the CTG repeat length and concentration of the PMO. PMO CTG25 reduced HTT-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and suppressed mutant HTT expression in vivo in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model. Finally, CTG28 reduced mutant HTT expression and improved the phenotype of Hdh(Q7/Q150) knock-in HD mice.

The genes in this locus were associated with progression in TRACK-HD (MSH3 p=2\u00b794 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup>DHFR p=8\u00b737 \u00d7 10<sup>-7</sup> MTRNR2L2 p=2\u00b715 \u00d7 10<sup>-9</sup>) and to a lesser extent in REGISTRY (MSH3 p=9\u00b736 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>DHFR p=8\u00b745 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>MTRNR2L2 p=1\u00b720 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup>). The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TRACK-HD (rs557874766) was genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (p=1\u00b758 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup>), and encodes an aminoacid change (Pro67Ala) in MSH3. In TRACK-HD, each copy of the minor allele at this SNP was associated with a 0\u00b74 units per year (95% CI 0\u00b716-0\u00b766) reduction in the rate of change of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score, and a reduction of 0\u00b712 units per year (95% CI 0\u00b706-0\u00b718) in the rate of change of UHDRS Total Functional Capacity score. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age of onset. The multidomain progression measure in TRACK-HD was associated with a functional variant that was genome-wide significant in our meta-analysis. The association in only 216 participants implies that the progression measure is a sensitive reflection of disease burden, that the effect size at this locus is large, or both.

CAG repeat length explains around half of the variation in age at onset (AAO) but genetic variation elsewhere in the genome accounts for a significant proportion of the remainder. Genome-wide association studies have identified a bidirectional signal on chromosome 15, likely underlain by FANCD2- and FANCI-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), a nuclease involved in DNA interstrand cross link repair. Here we show that increased FAN1 expression is significantly associated with delayed AAO and slower progression of HD, suggesting FAN1 is protective in the context of an expanded HTT CAG repeat. FAN1 overexpression in human cells reduces CAG repeat expansion in exogenously expressed mutant HTT exon 1, and in patient-derived stem cells and differentiated medium spiny neurons, FAN1 knockdown increases CAG repeat expansion. The stabilizing effects are FAN1 concentration and CAG repeat length-dependent. We show that FAN1 binds to the expanded HTT CAG repeat DNA and its nuclease activity is not required for protection against CAG repeat expansion. These data shed new mechanistic insights into how the genetic modifiers of HD act to alter disease progression and show that FAN1 affects somatic expansion of the CAG repeat through a nuclease-independent mechanism. This provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions in HD and potentially other triplet repeat disorders.",

HTT mRNA contains 67 exons and does not always splice between exon 1 and exon 2 leading to the production of a small polyadenylated HTTexon1 transcript, and the full-length HTT mRNA has three 3'UTR isoforms. We have developed a QuantiGene multiplex panel for the simultaneous detection of all of these mouse Htt transcripts directly from tissue lysates and demonstrate that this can replace the more work-intensive Taqman qPCR assays. We have applied this to the analysis of brain regions from the zQ175 HD mouse model and wild type littermates at two months of age. We show that the incomplete splicing of Htt occurs throughout the brain and confirm that this originates from the mutant and not endogenous Htt allele. Given that HTTexon1 encodes the highly pathogenic exon 1 HTT protein, it is essential that the levels of all Htt transcripts can be monitored when evaluating HTT lowering approaches. Our QuantiGene panel will allow the rapid comparative assessment of all Htt transcripts in cell lysates and mouse tissues without the need to first extract RNA.",

Recently, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying atypical and aggressive (CAG60+) HD variants have been generated and exhibit disparate molecular pathologies. Here we investigate two human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines carrying CAG37 and CAG51 typical late-onset repeat expansions in comparison to wildtype control lines during undifferentiated states and throughout forebrain neuronal differentiation. Pluripotent HD lines demonstrate growth, viability, pluripotent gene expression, mitochondrial activity and forebrain specification that is indistinguishable from control lines. Expression profiles of crucial genes known to be dysregulated in HD remain unperturbed in the presence of mutant protein and throughout differentiation; however, elevated glutamate-evoked responses were observed in HD CAG51 neurons. These findings suggest typical late-onset HD mutations do not alter pluripotent parameters or the capacity to generate forebrain neurons, but that such progeny may recapitulate hallmarks observed in established HD model systems. Such HD models will help further our understanding of the cascade of pathological events leading to disease onset and progression, while simultaneously facilitating the identification of candidate HD therapeutics.",

We found that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-\u03b4) interacts with HTT and that mutant HTT represses PPAR-\u03b4-mediated transactivation. Increased PPAR-\u03b4 transactivation ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and improved cell survival of neurons from mouse models of HD. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-\u03b4 in the central nervous system of mice was sufficient to induce motor dysfunction, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial abnormalities and transcriptional alterations that recapitulated HD-like phenotypes. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-\u03b4 specifically in the striatum of medium spiny neurons in mice yielded HD-like motor phenotypes, accompanied by striatal neuron loss. In mouse models of HD, pharmacologic activation of PPAR-\u03b4 using the agonist KD3010 improved motor function, reduced neurodegeneration and increased survival. PPAR-\u03b4 activation also reduced HTT-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in medium spiny-like neurons generated from stem cells derived from individuals with HD, indicating that PPAR-\u03b4 activation may be beneficial in HD and related disorders.",

Intermediate alleles (IAs) are in the range of 27-35 repeats and have been associated to a normal phenotype. The aim of this work was to analyze the association between intermediate huntingtin CAG-repeat alleles (IAs) and neurodegenerative diseases, other than HD. We screened the HTT CAG repeats in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 1126), Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 610), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (n = 225). We also studied 509 healthy controls (HCs). The relative frequency of IAs for each group was 6.03% in AD, 5.3% in FTLD, 3.5% in PD, and 2.9% in HCs. The frequency of IA was significantly higher among patients with AD when compared to HCs (p = 0.011, OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.19-3.74); no significant difference was observed in FTLD (p = 0.17; OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 0.85-4.03) and PD (p = 0.69; OR = 1.21; 95% CI (0.61-2.37) versus HCs. No atypical symptoms or clinical features distinctive of HD were found among carriers of IAs. We found 3 cases with CAG expansions within the pathological range, one diagnosed with AD, one with PD, and one with FTD. Results suggest that IAs might have a role in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, HD patients might be misdiagnosed with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly when CAG repeats are in the lower pathological range.",

Emergence and progression of HD depend on continuous expression of mutant Huntingtin protein (Htt). Therefore, blocking expression of mutant Htt might be a promising therapeutic strategy. We generated a high-capacity adenoviral (HC-Ad) vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to exon 1 of the htt gene. In vitro, this vector efficiently inhibited Htt expression in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines. In addition, the number of Htt-immunoreactive (IR) aggregates, a hallmark of HD pathology, was significantly reduced after gene transfer with this vector. Importantly, the attenuation of aggregate formation by shRNA was observed in vivo after stereotaxic injection into the striatum of mouse models of HD. The vector was tested in two models: the R6/2 transgenic mouse model and a mouse model based on the local injection of an adenoviral vector expressing a truncated version of mutant Htt. In both models an efficient reduction in mutant Htt aggregate load measured by decreased Htt-IR aggregate formation was observed. Our results support the further development of shRNA for HD therapy.",

Htt protein is ubiquitously expressed, but the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) is most susceptible to dysfunction and death. Abnormal gene expression represents a core pathogenic feature of HD, but the relative roles of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects on transcription remain unclear. To determine the extent of cell-autonomous dysregulation in the striatum in vivo, we examined genome-wide RNA expression in symptomatic D9-N171-98Q (a.k.a. DE5) transgenic mice in which the forebrain expression of the first 171 amino acids of human Htt with a 98Q repeat expansion is limited to MSNs. Microarray data generated from these mice were compared with those generated on the identical array platform from a pan-neuronal HD mouse model, R6/2, carrying two different CAG repeat lengths, and a relatively high degree of overlap of changes in gene expression was revealed. We further focused on known canonical pathways associated with excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, dopamine signaling and trophic support. While genes related to excitotoxicity, dopamine signaling and trophic support were altered in both DE5 and R6/2 mice, which may be either cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous, genes related to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor are primarily affected in DE5 transgenic mice, indicating cell-autonomous mechanisms. Overall, HD-induced dysregulation of the striatal transcriptome can be largely attributed to intrinsic effects of mutant Htt, in the absence of expression in cortical neurons.",

Here, we report that the transcript of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), a transcription factor that is critical for energy homeostasis, was markedly downregulated in multiple tissues of a mouse model (R6/2) of HD and in lymphocytes of HD patients. Therefore, downregulation of PPAR\u03b3 seems to be a pathomechanism of HD. Chronic treatment of R6/2 mice with an agonist of PPAR\u03b3 (thiazolidinedione, TZD) rescued progressive weight loss, motor deterioration, formation of mutant Htt aggregates, jeopardized global ubiquitination profiles, reduced expression of two neuroprotective proteins (brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Bcl-2) and shortened life span exhibited by these mice. By reducing HTT aggregates and, thus, ameliorating the recruitment of PPAR\u03b3 into HTT aggregates, chronic TZD treatment also elevated the availability of the PPAR\u03b3 protein and subsequently normalized the expression of two of its downstream genes (the glucose transporter type 4 and PPAR\u03b3 coactivator-1 alpha genes). The protective effects described above appear to have been exerted, at least partially, via direct activation of PPAR\u03b3 in the brain, as TZD was detected in the brains of mice treated with TZD and because a PPAR\u03b3 agonist (rosiglitazone) protected striatal cells from mHTT-evoked energy deficiency and toxicity. We demonstrated that the systematic downregulation of PPAR\u03b3 seems to play a critical role in the dysregulation of energy homeostasis observed in HD, and that PPAR\u03b3 is a potential therapeutic target for this disease.",

The resultant mutant HTT protein (mHTT) forms aggregates in various types of cells, including neurons and glial cells and preferentially affects brain function. We found that two HD mouse models (Hdh(150Q) and R6/2) were more susceptible than wild-type (WT) mice to lipopolysaccharide-evoked systemic inflammation and produced more proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. Such an enhanced inflammatory response in the brain was not observed in N171- 82Q mice that express mHTT only in neurons, but not in glial cells. Thus, HD glia might play an important role in chronic inflammation that accelerates disease progression in HD mice. Intriguingly, enhanced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-p65 (p65), a transcriptional mediator of inflammatory responses, was observed in astrocytes of patients and mice with HD. Results obtained using primary R6/2 astrocytes suggest that these cells exhibited higher I\u03baB kinase (IKK) activity that caused prolongation of NF-\u03baB activation, thus upregulating proinflammatory factors during inflammation. R6/2 astrocytes also produced a more-damaging effect on primary R6/2 neurons than did WT astrocytes during inflammation. Blockage of IKK reduced the neuronal toxicity caused by R6/2 astrocytes and ameliorated several HD symptoms of R6/2 mice (e.g. decreased neuronal density, impaired motor coordination and poor cognitive function). Collectively, our results indicate that enhancement of the p65-mediated inflammatory response in astrocytes contributes to HD pathogenesis.

When the number of trinucleotide CAG exceeds 40 repeats, disease invariably is manifested, characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. The huntingtin (Htt) protein and its mutant form (mutant huntingtin, mHtt) are ubiquitously expressed but although multiple brain regions are affected, the most vulnerable brain region is the striatum. Striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) preferentially degenerate, followed by the cortical pyramidal neurons located in layers V and VI. Proposed HD pathogenic mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, excitotoxicity, neurotrophic support deficits, collapse of the protein degradation mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional alterations, and disorders of myelin. Studies performed in cell type-specific and regionally selective HD mouse models implicate both MSN cell-autonomous properties and cell-cell interactions, particularly corticostriatal but also with non-neuronal cell types. Here, we review the intrinsic properties of MSNs that contribute to their selective vulnerability and in addition, we discuss how astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, together with aberrant corticostriatal connectivity, contribute to HD pathophysiology. In addition, mHtt causes cell-autonomous dysfunction in cell types other than MSNs.

Existing therapeutics are only symptomatic and do not significantly alter the disease progression or increase life expectancy. HD is caused by expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat region in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT), leading to the formation of mutant HTT transcripts (muHTT). The toxic gain-of-function of muHTT protein is a major cause of the disease. In addition, it has been suggested that the muHTT transcript contributes to the toxicity. Thus, reduction of both muHTT mRNA and protein levels would ideally be the most useful therapeutic option. We herein present a novel strategy for HD treatment using oligonucleotides (ONs) directly targeting the HTT trinucleotide repeat DNA. A partial, but significant and potentially long-term, HTT knock-down of both mRNA and protein was successfully achieved. Diminished phosphorylation of HTT gene-associated RNA-polymerase II is demonstrated, suggestive of reduced transcription downstream the ON-targeted repeat. Different backbone chemistries were found to have a strong impact on the ON efficiency. We also successfully use different delivery vehicles as well as naked uptake of the ONs, demonstrating versatility and possibly providing insights for in vivo applications.",

We observed that haplotype A, marked by HTT delta2642, was enriched in HD chromosomes and carried the two largest expansions reported in the Portuguese population. However, the most frequent HD haplotype B carried one of the largest (+12 CAGs) expansions, which resulted in an allele class change to full penetrance. Despite having a normal CAG distribution skewed to the higher end of the range, these two core haplotypes had similar expanded CAG repeat sizes compared to the other major core haplotypes (C and D) and there was no statistical difference in transmitted repeat instability across haplotypes.

In patients with WG, high expression of PR3 on the surface of nonprimed neutrophils is associated with an increased incidence and rate of relapse. In this study, we analyzed the functional significance of constitutive PR3 expression for neutrophil activation as induced by anti-PR3 antibody. Therefore, primed and nonprimed neutrophils were stimulated with the monoclonal anti-PR3 antibody PR3G-3. Activation was measured as actin polymerization by the phalloidin assay as an early, detectable activation event and oxidative burst by the dihydrorhodamine assay, as a late, detectable activation event. In contrast to the oxidative burst, we found that anti-PR3 antibody-induced actin polymerization could be triggered in neutrophils without priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, a correlation was found between the level of PR3 expression on the surface of these nonprimed neutrophils and the degree of actin polymerization. However, after priming with TNF-alpha, no correlation was found between membrane expression of PR3 and the level of actin polymerization or respiratory burst as induced by anti-PR3 antibody. These data suggest that the presence of PR3 on the surface of nonprimed neutrophils has consequences for their susceptibility to the initial activation step by anti-PR3 antibodies.

We undertook this study to assess the differential expression of CD177 on neutrophils from patients with ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (ASV) in comparison with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and healthy individuals, and to investigate whether colocalization of mPR3 and CD177 affects anti-PR3-mediated neutrophil activation. Expression of CD177 and mPR3 was analyzed by flow cytometry on isolated neutrophils from patients with ASV (n=53), those with SLE (n=30), those with RA (n=26), and healthy controls (n=31). Neutrophil activation mediated by anti-PR3 antibodies was assessed by measuring the oxidative burst with a dihydrorhodamine assay. Percentages of CD177-expressing neutrophils were significantly higher in patients with ASV and those with SLE than in healthy controls. In 3 healthy donors, CD177 expression was not detected. After priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha, neutrophils remained negative for CD177 while mPR3 expression was induced. Neutrophils from CD177-negative donors or CD177- neutrophils sorted from donors with bimodal expression were susceptible to anti-PR3-mediated oxidative burst. Variation in the extent of anti-PR3-mediated neutrophil activation among different donors occurred independent of the percentage of CD177-expressing neutrophils. Membrane expression of CD177 on circulating neutrophils is increased in patients with ASV and in those with SLE, but not in RA patients.

Human glioblastoma T98G cells and human glioma U251 cells were used as glioma cells. Cell viability was evaluated by WST-8 assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by measurement of caspase-3 activity and DNA-fragmentation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species were evaluated by dihydrorhodamine assay. While the degree of NPe6-PDT induced cell death unchanged in T98G and U251 cells when temozolomide treatment was adjuvant, it was dose-dependently increased by concomitant treatment with temozolomide. Further, concomitantly administered temozolomide dose-dependently increased caspase-3 activity and DNA-fragmentation, while adjuvant-temozolomide did not. These results are suggesting that concomitantly administered temozolomide potentiates the effect of NPe6-PDT to facilitate apoptotic cell death. Additionally, concomitantly administered temozolomide increased intracellular NPe6-fluorescence and reactive oxygen species, suggesting that the augmentation effect of combined treatment may be due to increased intracellular accumulation of NPe6.

We detected the female relatives within the families of male patients with CGD, and carried out the 123 dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay in all female participants. All carriers were questioned for current or past established DL diagnosis. We detected 33 families with one or more CGD male patients; we found an XL-CGD in 79% of the relatives from at least one female relative with a bimodal pattern. For the remaining seven relatives we were not able to confirm a carrier status by means of a DHR assay. Moreover, we detected one mother with CGD secondary to skewed X-chromosome inactivation.

Here, we describe the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and its active metabolite in healthy volunteers and the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation to support dose selection for phase IIB in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Two trials were conducted in healthy male volunteers. In the first trial, filgotinib was administered as single doses from 10 mg up to multiple daily doses of 200 mg. In the second trial, daily doses of 300 and 450 mg for 10 days were evaluated. Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine individual pharmacokinetic parameters for filgotinib and its metabolite. The overall pharmacodynamic activity for the two moieties was assessed in whole blood using interleukin-6-induced phosphorylation of signal-transducer and activator of transcription 1 as a biomarker for JAK1 activity. These data were used to conduct non-linear mixed-effects modeling to investigate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship. Modeling and simulation on the basis of early clinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib are dose proportional up to 200 mg, in agreement with observed data, and support that both filgotinib and its metabolite contribute to its pharmacodynamic effects. Simulation of biomarker response supports that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect is reached at a daily dose of 200 mg filgotinib. Based on these results, a daily dose range up to 200 mg has been selected for phase IIB dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

As RA patients might be treated with multiple medications simultaneously, possible drug-drug interactions of filgotinib with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with key drug transporters were evaluated in vitro and in clinical studies. The enzymes involved in filgotinib's metabolism and the potential interactions of the parent and its active major metabolite with drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, were identified using recombinant enzymes, human microsomes, and cell systems. Furthermore, filgotinib's interaction potential with CYP3A4 was examined in an open-label study in healthy volunteers, which evaluated the impact of filgotinib co-administration on the CYP3A4-sensitive substrate midazolam. The potential interaction with the common RA drug methotrexate was investigated in a clinical study in RA patients. In vitro, filgotinib and its active metabolite at clinically relevant concentrations did not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, and did not inhibit key drug transporters. In the clinic, a lack of relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions by filgotinib and its active metabolite with substrates of CYP3A4, as well as with organic anion transporters involved in methotrexate elimination were found. the collective in vivo and in vitro data on drug-metabolizing enzymes and on key drug transporters, support co-administration of filgotinib with commonly used RA drugs to patients without the need for dose adjustments.",

We undertook this study to test our hypothesis that selective inhibition of JAK-1 would combine good efficacy with a better safety profile compared with less selective JAK inhibitors. In two 4-week exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa trials, 127 RA patients with an insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX) received filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) oral capsules (100 mg twice daily or 30, 75, 150, 200, or 300 mg once daily) or placebo, added onto a stable regimen of MTX, to evaluate safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of filgotinib. The primary efficacy end point was the number and percentage of patients in each treatment group meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at week 4. Treatment with filgotinib at 75-300 mg met the primary end point and showed early onset of efficacy. ACR20 response rates progressively increased to week 4, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level decreased. Marked and sustained improvements were observed in serum CRP level and other PD markers. The PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite was dose proportional over the 30-300 mg range. Early side effects seen with other less selective JAK inhibitors were not observed (e.g., there was no worsening of anemia [JAK-2 inhibition related], no effects on liver transaminases, and no increase in low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol). A limited decrease in neutrophils without neutropenia was consistent with immunomodulatory effects through JAK-1 inhibition. There were no infections. Overall, filgotinib was well tolerated. Events related to study drug were mild or moderate and transient during therapy, and the most common such event was nausea. Selective inhibition of JAK-1 with filgotinib shows initial efficacy in RA with an encouraging safety profile in these exploratory studies.",

Being proteins, they are administered parenterally. The first oral targeted small molecules approved for RA are competitive inhibitors of the Janus kinase (JAK) enzyme family which mediate signalling for a cytokine subset important in RA pathogenesis. Areas covered: Several JAK inhibitors have been developed with differing selectivity for the four JAK enzymes with a view to generating oral, multi-cytokine inhibitors. Here we review the pharmacology and clinical trial data for efficacy and safety of filgotinib, an investigational selective JAK1 inhibitor. We contextualise the contemporary approach to RA management and substantial unmet needs that remain. Expert opinion: The selectivity of filgotinib for JAK1 may have theoretical advantages in terms of limiting toxicity. However, establishing whether this is so before larger numbers of patients are exposed in phase III and beyond in the real word setting, will be difficult. Filgotinib clinical trial data to date has been encouraging with rapid, sustained efficacy with promising safety and tolerability. We are likely to see an expanding choice of approved JAK inhibitors in the clinic but it may not be straightforward to distinguish safety and efficacy differences.",

We performed a longitudinal behavioral study of the newly developed HdhQ350/+ mouse line, a knock-in model that expresses a repeat of 350 glutamines. We found remarkable sex-dependent differences on symptom onset and severity. While both sexes lose weight and grip strength, only HdhQ350/+ males have impaired motor coordination as measured by the rotarod and alterations in gait as measured by the catwalk assay. While HdhQ350/+ females do not exhibit impairment in motor coordination, we found a reduction in dark phase locomotor activity. Male and female HdhQ350/+ mice do not show anxiety as measured by the elevated plus maze or changes in exploration as measured by the open field test. To investigate these sex-dependent differences, we performed western blot analyses of striatal tissue. We measured equal mutant huntingtin protein expression in both sexes and found evidence of aggregation. We found the expected decrease of DARPP-32 expression only in female HdhQ350/+ mice. Remarkably, we found no evidence of reduction in synaptophysin or CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in HdhQ350/+ tissue of either sex.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited NDD caused by autosomal-dominant expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat mutation in the gene coding for Huntingtin (Htt). Previous studies have suggested the coexistence of phosphorylated-Tau, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions in HD. However, definite evidence that HD pathology in humans can be accompanied by other proteinopathies is still lacking. Using human post-mortem putamen samples from 31 controls and 56 HD individuals, we performed biochemical analyses of the expression, oligomerization and aggregation of Tau, \u03b1-Syn, TDP-43, and Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/A\u03b2. In HD brain, we observed reduced soluble protein (but not mRNA) levels of Htt, \u03b1-Syn, and Tau. Our results also support abnormal phosphorylation of Tau in more advanced stages of disease. Aberrant splicing of Tau exons 2, 3 (exclusion) and 10 (inclusion) was also detected in HD patients, leading to higher 0N4R and lower 1N3R isoforms. Finally, following formic acid extraction, we observed increased aggregation of TDP-43, \u03b1-Syn, and phosphorylated-Tau during HD progression. Notably, we observed that 88% of HD patients with Vonsattel grade 4 neuropathology displayed at least one non-Htt proteinopathy compared to 29% in controls. Interestingly, \u03b1-Syn aggregation correlated with Htt, TDP-43 and phosphorylated-Tau in HD but not in controls. The impact of this work is twofold: (1) it provides compelling evidences that Tau, \u03b1-Syn and TDP-43 proteinopathies are increased in HD, and (2) it suggests the involvement of common mechanisms leading to abnormal accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins in NDD. Further studies will be needed to decipher the impact of these proteinopathies on clinical manifestation of HD.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. The monogenic mutation in HD encodes a variant of the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The disease is a consequence of a CAG repeat extension leading to an abnormally long polyglutamine (Q) stretch at HTT's N-terminus, which likely confers a toxic gain of function to the mutant polypeptide. HD has currently no effective disease-modifying therapy or preventive measures. In the past 2decades, a sizable body of work on Sirtuins' modification of HD pathology using HD cell and animal models has accumulated. In this chapter, evidence for Sirtuin activities as potential modifiers of HD pathology is reviewed. The conflicting findings of the impacts of mammalian Sirtuin paralogs on HD pathogenesis and disease progression are highlighted. The possible cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Sirtuin activities in HD are discussed with reference to pathophysiological mechanisms of transcription perturbation, proteostasis, mitochondrial function, and microtubule dynamics.

This strategy has proved less successful for most human disorders which are not recessive, and where a single copy of the aberrant gene has clinically significant effects even though the normal gene product is present. An alternative approach that eliminates the impediment of a normal protein in affected individuals is to study homozygotes for the mutant allele. For virtually all dominant human disorders in which homozygotes have been described, symptoms have been significantly more severe in the homozygote than in the heterozygote. Thus, these disorders do not conform to the classical definition of dominance which states that homozygotes and heterozygotes for a defect are phenotypically indistinguishable. Instead, they display incomplete dominance, indicating that the normal allele may play a role in ameliorating the disease process. The D4S10 locus, defined by the probe G8 and linked to the gene for Huntington's disease (HD), has permitted us to identify individuals with a high probability of being homozygous for this autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. These homozygotes do not differ in clinical expression or course from typical HD heterozygotes.

The main pathway for brain cholesterol elimination is its hydroxylation into 24S-hydroxycholesterol by the cholesterol 24-hydrolase, CYP46A1. Increasing evidence suggests that CYP46A1 has a role in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders, and that increasing its levels in the brain is neuroprotective. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection remain to be fully understood. Huntington's disease is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal CAG expansion in huntingtin's gene. Among the multiple cellular and molecular dysfunctions caused by this mutation, altered brain cholesterol homeostasis has been described in patients and animal models as a critical event in Huntington's disease. Here, we demonstrate that a gene therapy approach based on the delivery of CYP46A1, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol degradation in the brain, has a long-lasting neuroprotective effect in Huntington's disease and counteracts multiple detrimental effects of the mutated huntingtin. In zQ175 Huntington's disease knock-in mice, CYP46A1 prevented neuronal dysfunctions and restored cholesterol homeostasis. These events were associated to a specific striatal transcriptomic signature that compensates for multiple mHTT-induced dysfunctions. We thus explored the mechanisms for these compensations and showed an improvement of synaptic activity and connectivity along with the stimulation of the proteasome and autophagy machineries, which participate to the clearance of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates. Furthermore, BDNF vesicle axonal transport and TrkB endosome trafficking were restored in a cellular model of Huntington's disease. These results highlight the large-scale beneficial effect of restoring cholesterol homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases and give new opportunities for developing innovative disease-modifying strategies in Huntington's disease.",

A key translational step for this approach is extension to the larger non-human primate brain, achieving sufficient distribution of small interfering RNA targeting Htt (siHtt) and levels of Htt suppression that may have therapeutic benefit. We evaluated the potential for convection enhanced delivery (CED) of siHtt to provide widespread and robust suppression of Htt in nonhuman primates. siHtt was infused continuously for 7 or 28 days into the nonhuman primate putamen to analyze effects of infusion rate and drug concentration on the volume of effective suppression. Distribution of radiolabeled siHtt and Htt suppression were quantified by autoradiography and PCR, respectively, in tissue punches. Histopathology was evaluated and Htt suppression was also visualized in animals treated for 28 days. Seven days of CED led to widespread distribution of siHtt and significant Htt silencing throughout the nonhuman primate striatum in an infusion rate and dose dependent manner. Htt suppression at therapeutic dose levels was well tolerated by the brain. A model developed from these results predicts that continuous CED of siHtt can achieve significant coverage of the striatum of Huntington's disease patients. These findings suggest that this approach may provide an important therapeutic strategy for treating Huntington's disease.",

Although the Huntington protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed, expansion of the polyglutamine tract in Htt leads to the progressive loss of specific neuronal subpopulations in HD brains. In this article, we will summarize the current understanding on mechanisms of how mutant Htt can elicit cytotoxicity, as well as how the selective sets of neuronal cell death occur in HD brains.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25356969": "Huntington disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease of mid-life onset caused by expansion of a polymorphic trinucleotide (CAG) repeat. Variable penetrance for alleles carrying 36-39 repeats has been noted, but the disease appears fully penetrant when the repeat numbers are &gt;40. An abnormal CAG repeat may expand, contract, or be stably transmitted when passed from parent to child. Assays used to diagnose Huntington disease must be optimized to ensure the accurate and unambiguous quantitation of CAG repeat length. This document provides an overview of Huntington disease and methodological considerations for Huntington disease testing. Examples of laboratory reports are also included.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764008": "Huntington disease (HD) is a well-defined autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in HD gene. There are a significant number of HD cases where this mutation was not found and such cases are named HD-like phenotype (HDL). This article reports 48 patients with HDL phenotype. Patients were analyzed on the presence of mutations in prion (PrP), ferritin and junctophilin-3 (JP-3) genes. None of the patients showed the presence of the mutation in analyzed genes. This could suggest that there is some other gene/genes where the mutation can cause the disease with clinical features of HD.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054767": "Primary neuronal cultures are a useful tool for measuring pharmacological- and transgene-regulated gene expression; however, accurate measurements can be confounded by heterogeneous cell types and inconsistent transfection efficiency. Here we describe our adaptation of a ribosomal capture strategy that was designed to be used in transgenic mice expressing tagged ribosomal subunits (RiboTag) in specific cell types, thereby allowing measurement of translating RNAs from desired cell types within complex tissues. Using this strategy we were able to isolate and analyze neuron-specific RNA despite the presence of glia by co-transfecting experimental plasmids with plasmids that selectively express RiboTag in neurons. RiboTag immunoprecipitation was capable of recovering high integrity RNA from small numbers of transfected cells that can then be interrogated by a variety of methods (e.g., RT-qPCR, PCR array, RNA-Seq) and compared with basal RNA expression of the entire culture. Additionally, we demonstrate how co-transfection of RiboTag with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs can validate and accurately assess the degree of gene expression knockdown, and how RiboTag can be used to measure receptor-mediated gene regulation with transiently expressed designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). RiboTag co-transfection represents a convenient and powerful tool to isolate RNA from a specific subset of cultured cells with a variety of applications for experiments in vitro.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15378499": " Analysis conducted in the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort of atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki found a significant dose-related excess of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and the pituitary gland. The objective of the current study was to evaluate clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of first primary tumors of the CNS and the pituitary gland in this cohort and to compare them with characteristics among other populations. CNS and pituitary gland tumors that were diagnosed between 1958 and 1995 among 80,160 LSS cohort members were ascertained through Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries, autopsy reports, and other sources. Pathologists reviewed all available records and slides to verify histologic diagnoses. Poisson regression analysis was used to model background incidence rates allowing for radiation effects. Meningioma was the most common tumor among clinically diagnosed tumors, followed by neuroepithelial tumor, schwannoma, and pituitary tumor. The overall incidence of these tumors increased initially with age but declined among the elderly. For all age groups and for both genders, incidence increased over time. By contrast, when tumors diagnosed at autopsy were included, incidence rose continuously with age and was stable over time. The main characteristics of CNS and pituitary gland tumors diagnosed in the LSS cohort were consistent with the characteristics of \"spontaneous\" tumors observed in other population-based studies. The predominance of meningiomas over neuroepithelial tumors in the Japanese population was noteworthy and warrants further investigation. The secular rise in incidence of all clinically diagnosed CNS and pituitary gland tumors is most likely to be attributable to the increased use of new imaging techniques.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381708": " The risk of developing nervous system tumors following exposure to ionizing radiation is not well quantified. We characterized the incidence of nervous system tumors among atomic bomb survivors as a function of radiation dose. Tumors of the nervous system and pituitary gland diagnosed between 1958 and 1995 among 80 160 atomic bomb survivors were ascertained using the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries, medical records, and death certificates. Pathologists reviewed slides and medical records to provide histologic diagnoses. Poisson regression analyses were used to characterize radiation effects on tumor incidence, which are expressed as excess relative risk per sievert (ERR(Sv)). All statistical tests were two-sided. A statistically significant dose-related excess of nervous system tumors was observed in the cohort (ERR(Sv) = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6 to 2.1). The highest ERR(Sv) was seen for schwannoma (4.5, 95% CI = 1.9 to 9.2). The risk for all other nervous system tumors as a group is also statistically significantly elevated (ERR(Sv) = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.1 to 1.3). Risk increases, although not statistically significant, were seen for meningiomas (ERR(Sv) = 0.6, 95% CI = -0.01 to 1.8), gliomas (ERR(Sv) = 0.6, 95% CI = -0.2 to 2.0), other nervous system tumors (ERR(Sv) = 0.5, 95% CI = &lt;-0.2 to 2.2), and pituitary tumors (ERR(Sv) = 1.0, 95% CI = &lt;-0.2 to 3.5). The dose-response relationships were linear. For nervous system tumors other than schwannoma, excess risks were higher for men than for women and for those exposed during childhood than for those exposed during adulthood. A statistically significant dose response was observed for all nervous system tumors combined and for schwannoma considered separately, indicating that exposure to even moderate doses (i.e., &lt;1 Sv) of radiation is associated with an elevated incidence of nervous system tumors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10408177": "Since the atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, high incidences of leukemia, thyroid cancer and other tumors have been reported as atomic bomb-induced tumors. We investigated the incidence of meningioma among Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors. Sixty-eight patients surgically treated for meningioma who had been within 2.0 km of the hypocenter of the explosion were identified. Six hundred and seven non-exposed patients with meningioma were also studied. Treatment dates were from 1975 to 1992. The incidences of meningioma among 68 subjects within 2.0 km and 607 non-exposed patients were 8.7 and 3.0 cases per 10(5) persons per year, respectively. The incidences of meningioma among the survivors of Hiroshima in 5-year intervals since 1975 were 5.3, 7.4, 10.1, and 14.9, respectively. The incidences of meningioma classified by distances from the hypocenter of 1.5-2.0 km, 1.0-1.5 km and less than 1.0 km were 6.3, 7.6 and 20.0, respectively. The incidences of meningioma classified by doses to the brain of 0-0.099 Sv, 0.1-0.99 Sv and more than 1.0 Sv were 7.7, 9.2 and 18.2, respectively. The incidence of meningioma among Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors has increased since 1975. There was a significant correlation between the incidence and the dose of radiation to the brain. The present findings strongly suggest that meningioma is one of the tumors induced by atomic bombing in Hiroshima.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8707402": "Among the Nagasaki atomic-bomb survivors registered at the Scientific Data Center for Atomic-Bomb Disaster, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, 45 cases of surgically treated intracranial meningioma were collected from 6 hospitals with departments of neurosurgery in or near Nagasaki City during the period from 1973 to 1992. All 45 patients were over 40 years of age at the time of diagnosis. Subsequently, the 45 cases were statistically analyzed in relationship to the estimated distance from the hypocenter by age, gender, intracranial location, histology and latent period. The analysis showed a high correlation between incidence of meningiomas and distance from the hypocenter. The incidence among Nagasaki atomic-bomb survivors over 40 years of age, especially in those proximally exposed, appears to be increasing, in inverse proportion to the exposure distance, since 1981, 36 years after the explosion of the atomic bomb.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216534": " Levodopa remains the gold-standard treatment for PD. However, it becomes less effective as the disease progresses and produces debilitating side effects, such as motor fluctuations and l-dopa-induced dyskinesia. Modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 represents a promising antiparkinsonian approach in combination with l-dopa, but it has not been demonstrated in primates. We studied whether a novel positive allosteric modulator of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 4, PXT002331 (foliglurax), could reduce parkinsonism in primate models. We assessed the therapeutic potential of PXT002331 in three models of MPTP-induced parkinsonism in macaques. These models represent three different stages of disease evolution: early stage and advanced stage with and without l-dopa-induced dyskinesia. As an adjunct to l-dopa, PXT002331 induced a robust and dose-dependent reversal of parkinsonian motor symptoms in macaques, including bradykinesia, tremor, posture, and mobility. Moreover, PXT002331 strongly decreased dyskinesia severity, thus having therapeutic efficacy on both parkinsonian motor impairment and l-dopa-induced dyskinesia. PXT002331 brain penetration was also assessed using PET imaging in macaques, and pharmacodynamic analyses support target engagement in the therapeutic effects of PXT002331. This work provides a demonstration that a positive allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 can alleviate the motor symptoms of PD and the motor complications induced by l-dopa in primates. PXT002331 is the first compound of its class to enter phase IIa clinical trials. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24038889": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder. Clinical features include growth retardation, intellectual disability, limb defects, typical facial dysmorphism, and other systemic involvement. The increased understanding of the genetic basis of CdLS has led to diagnostic improvement and expansion of the phenotype. Mutations in five genes (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8), all regulators or structural components of cohesin, have been identified. Approximately 60% of CdLS cases are due to NIPBL mutations, 5% caused by mutations in SMC1A, RAD21, and HDAC8 and one proband was found to carry a mutation in SMC3. To date, 311 CdLS-causing mutations are known including missense, nonsense, small deletions and insertions, splice site mutations, and genomic rearrangements. Phenotypic variability is seen both intra- and intergenically. This article reviews the spectrum of CdLS mutations with a particular emphasis on their correlation to the clinical phenotype."
