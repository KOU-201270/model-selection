We hypothesized that the gastrointestinal resident bacteria would demonstrate predictable, dose-dependent changes after radiation exposure across two large animal models of acute radiation syndrome. Here, G\u00f6ttingen minipigs (GMP) (n = 50) and rhesus macaques (n = 48) were exposed to five dose levels (resulting in mortality rates of 33-100% and 25-68.7%, respectively). Fecal samples taken prior to and after irradiation (day 0 for GMP; day 0, 3 and 14 for macaques) were used for 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high-throughput sequencing. Baseline gut microbiota profiles were dissimilar between GMP and macaques, however, radiation appeared to have similar effect at the phylum level, resulting in Bacteroidetes decrease and Firmicutes increase in both models. The abundance of the main Bacteroidetes genus ( Bacteroides for GMP, Prevotella for macaques) was profoundly decreased by irradiation. Intracellular symbionts [Elusimicrobia in GMP, Treponema (Spirochaetes) in macaques] consistently increased after irradiation, suggesting their use as potential biomarkers of intestinal injury, and potential negative effect on health. Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium XIVa, Oscillibacter and Elusimicrobium/ Treponema abundances were found to be very significantly correlated with radiation intensity. Furthermore, Prevotella, Enterorhabdus and Ruminococcus and Enterorhabdus maintenance was strongly associated with survival in GMP, while Prevotella, Oscillibacter and Treponema were strongly associated with survival and Streptococcus with death in macaques. Overall, we found that a wide range of gut bacterial genera known to be abundant in the human gut microbiota are excellent biomarkers of radiation intensity and resilience in animal models, and that detrimental effects can be monitored, and potentially prevented, by targeting selected genera.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343431": "In rodent studies, the gut microbiota has been implicated in facilitating both radioresistance, by protecting the epithelium from apoptotic responses and radiosensitivity, inducing endothelial apoptotic responses. Despite the observation that large animal models, such as the Chinese Rhesus macaque and the Gottingen Minipig, demonstrate similarity to human physiologic responses to radiation, little is known about radiation-induced changes of the gut microbiome in these models. To compare the two models, we used bioequivalent radiation doses which resulted in an LD50 for Gottingen Minipigs and Chinese Rhesus macaques, 1.9 Gy and 6.8 Gy, respectively. Fecal samples taken prior and 3 days post-radiation were used for 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Baseline gut microbiota profiles were dissimilar between minipigs and rhesus macaques. Irradiation profoundly impacted gut microbiota profiles in both animals. Significant increases of intracellular symbionts were common to both models and to reported changes in rodents suggesting universality of these findings post-radiation. Remarkably, opposite dynamics were observed for the main phyla, with increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in minipigs but with enrichment of Bacteroidetes in rhesus macaques. Minipig changes in magnitude and in variety of species affected were more extensive than those observed in rhesus macaques. This pilot study provides an important first step in comparing the radiosensitive pig model to the comparatively more radioresistant macaque model, for the identification of microbial elements which may influence radiosensitivity.",

Successful applications of SIT rely on the high-level ecological fitness of sterile males. A suitable and stable gut microbiome can contribute to the ecological fitness of insect by influencing their physiology, biochemistry and development processes. Here, we show that a shift in the gut bacterial composition and structure by sterilizing irradiation, characterized by a decrease in the major gut microbiota community Enterobacteriaceae, an expansion of the minor members (e.g., Bacillaceae) and a higher richness and diversity, is tightly linked to radiation-induced ecological fitness (male mating competitiveness, flight capacity, survival rate and life span) decline in <i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i> (Hendel) sterile males. Function prediction of gut microbiota indicated that changes in microbiome taxonomy tend to drive microbiome functional shifts. A higher nutrient consumption of the flourishing minor gut microbiota may cause a decline in nutrients and energy metabolic activity of host and then result in the reduced ecological fitness of irradiated flies. Furthermore, we found that a gut bacterial strain <i>Klebsiella oxytoca</i> (BD177) can restore ecological fitness by improving food intake and increasing haemolymph sugar and amino acid levels of irradiated <i>B. dorsalis</i> flies. Our findings suggest that gut symbiont-based probiotics can be used as agents for reversing radiation-induced ecological fitness decrease.",

T-cell checkpoint blockade may improve patient survival. However, checkpoint molecules on cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell, a non-specific adoptive immunotherapy, remain unknown. In present study, we detected the dynamic expression of eight major checkpoint molecules (CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM- 3, CEACAM-1, LAG-3, TIGIT and BTLA) on CIK cells from NSCLC patients. The majority of these molecules, except BTLA, were sharply elevated during the early stage of CIK cell culture. Thereafter, PD-1 and TIGIT expressions decreased gradually towards the initial level (day 0). Moreover, CTLA-4 faded away during the later stage of CIK culture. LAG-3 expression decreased but was still significantly higher than the initial level. Of note, PD-L1 remained stably upregulated during CIK culture compared with PD-1, indicating that PD-L1 might act as an inhibitory molecule on CIK cells instead of PD-1. Furthermore, TIM-3 and CEACAM1 were strongly expressed simultaneously during long-term CIK culture and showed a significant and mutually positive correlation. BTLA displayed a distinct pattern, and its expression gradually decreased throughout the CIK culture. These observations suggested that CIK cells might be partly exhausted before clinical transfusion, characterized by the high expression of PD-L1, LAG-3, TIM- 3, and CEACAM-1 and the low expression of TIGIT, BTLA, PD-1, and CTLA-4 compared with initial culture. Our results imply that implementing combined treatment on CIK cells before transfusion via antibodies targeting PD-L1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and CEACAM-1 might improve the efficiency of CIK therapy for NSCLC patients.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846884": "The sixth \"Melanoma Bridge Meeting\" took place in Naples, Italy, December 1st-4th, 2015. The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and 4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin's disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers. Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR) modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors on T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients' population. This meeting's specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays.",

However, only a select group of patients respond to these interventions. The identification of biomarkers that predict clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockade is critical to successful clinical translation of these agents. We conducted an integrated analysis of three independent large datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas of lung adenocarcinoma and two datasets from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), Profiling of Resistance Patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax (named PROSPECT) and Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (named BATTLE-1). Comprehensive analysis of mRNA gene expression, reverse-phase protein array, IHC, and correlation with clinical data were performed. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma, independent of tumor mutational burden. We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT phenotype. Furthermore, we identify B7-H3 as a prognostic marker for NSCLC. The strong association between EMT status and an inflammatory tumor microenvironment with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules warrants further investigation of using EMT as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade agents and other immunotherapies in NSCLC and possibly a broad range of other cancers.

Furthermore, our understanding of the diversity of the NSCLC tumor immune microenvironment remains limited. <b>METHODS.</b> We performed comprehensive flow cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next-generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). <b>RESULTS.</b> Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically \"hot\" cluster with abundant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 and an immunologically \"cold\" cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The \"hot\" cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the \"hot\" cluster.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29721382": "Co-stimulatory and inhibitory receptors expressed by immune cells in the tumor microenvironment modulate the immune response and cancer progression. Their expression and regulation are still not fully characterized and a better understanding of these mechanisms is needed to improve current immunotherapies. Our previous work has identified a novel ligand/receptor pair, LLT1/CD161, that modulates immune responses. Here, we extensively characterize its expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that LLT1 expression is restricted to germinal center (GC) B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), representing a new hallmark of the presence of active TLS in the tumor microenvironment. CD161-expressing immune cells are found at the vicinity of these structures, with a global enrichment of NSCLC tumors in CD161<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as compared to normal distant lung and peripheral blood. CD161<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are more activated and produce Th1-cytokines at a higher frequency than their matched CD161-negative counterparts. Interestingly, CD161<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells highly express OX40 co-stimulatory receptor, less frequently 4-1BB, and display an activated but not completely exhausted PD-1-positive Tim-3-negative phenotype. Finally, a meta-analysis revealed a positive association of <i>CLEC2D</i> (coding for LLT1) and <i>KLRB1</i> (coding for CD161) gene expression with favorable outcome in NSCLC, independently of the size of T and B cell infiltrates. These data are consistent with a positive impact of LLT1/CD161 on NSCLC patient survival, and make CD161-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells ideal candidates for efficient anti-tumor recall responses.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440769": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is able to drive metastasis during progression of multiple cancer types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As resistance to immunotherapy has been associated with EMT and immune exclusion in melanoma, it is important to understand alterations to T-cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment during EMT in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. We conducted an integrated analysis of the immune landscape in NSCLCs through EMT scores derived from a previously established 16 gene signature of canonical EMT markers. EMT was associated with exclusion of immune cells critical in the immune response to cancer, with significantly lower infiltration of CD4 T-cells in lung adenocarcinoma and CD4/CD8 T-cells in squamous cell carcinoma. EMT was also associated with increased expression of multiple immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. Furthermore, overexpression of targetable immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4 and TIM-3 were associated with EMT in both NSCLCs. An association may exist between immune exclusion and EMT in NSCLC. Further investigation is merited as its mechanism is not completely understood and a better understanding of this association could lead to the development of biomarkers that could accurately predict response to immunotherapy.",

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous phosphatase involved in the regulation of DNA-damage response (DDR) and cell-cycle checkpoint pathways. Recent studies have shown that LB100, a small-molecule inhibitor of PP2A, sensitizes cancer cells to radiation-mediated DNA damage. We hypothesized that LB100 could sensitize ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. We performed in vitro studies in SKOV-3, OVCAR-8, and PEO1, -4, and -6 ovarian cancer lines to assess cytotoxicity potentiation, cell-death mechanism(s), cell-cycle regulation, and DDR signaling. In vivo studies were conducted in an intraperitoneal metastatic mouse model using SKOV-3/f-Luc cells. LB100 sensitized ovarian carcinoma lines to cisplatin-mediated cell death. Sensitization via LB100 was mediated by abrogation of cell-cycle arrest induced by cisplatin. Loss of the cisplatin-induced checkpoint correlated with decreased Wee1 expression, increased cdc2 activation, and increased mitotic entry (p-histone H3). LB100 also induced constitutive hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (BRCA1, Chk2, and \u03b3H2AX), altered the chronology and persistence of JNK activation, and modulated the expression of 14-3-3 binding sites. In vivo, cisplatin sensitization via LB100 significantly enhanced tumor growth inhibition and prevented disease progression after treatment cessation. Our results suggest that LB100 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo by modulation of the DDR pathway and cell-cycle checkpoint abrogation.",

To fully realize the advantages of hadron therapy over traditional x-ray and gamma-ray therapy requires accurate positioning of the Bragg peak throughout the tumor being treated. A half century ago, suggestions had already been made to use protons themselves to develop images of tumors and surrounding tissue, to be used for treatment planning. The recent global expansion of hadron therapy, coupled with modern advances in computation and particle detection, has led several collaborations around the world to develop prototype detector systems and associated reconstruction codes for proton computed tomography (pCT), as well as more simple proton radiography, with the ultimate intent to use such systems in clinical treatment planning and verification. Recent imaging results of phantoms in hospital proton beams are encouraging, but many technical and programmatic challenges remain to be overcome before pCT scanners will be introduced into clinics. This review introduces hadron therapy and the perceived advantages of pCT and proton radiography for treatment planning, reviews its historical development, and discusses the physics related to proton imaging, the associated experimental and computation issues, the technologies used to attack the problem, contemporary efforts in detector and computational development, and the current status and outlook.",

In SLE patients, genetic variants of IRF5 and IRF7 have been associated with increased serum IFN\u03b1 levels, suggesting a pathogenic role in the type I IFN response. Clinical and molecular analyses of an SLE patient treated with high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous stem cell transplant was performed. Western blot analysis showed that induction of IRF7 protein expression correlated with recurrent lupus disease activity. In addition, phosphorylation of IRF3 and activation of 4 E-BP1, a translational repressor of IRF7, preceded the disease flare. In SLE post-transplant, recurrent disease activity and induction of IRF7 protein expression correlated with activation of the IFN signature. This unique trend in regulation of IRF warrants further mechanistic investigation and confirmation with increased numbers of SLE patients.",

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib (TOFA) for controlling IFN signalling via the JAK-STAT pathway and as a therapeutic for SLE. We treated NZB/NZW F1 mice with TOFA and assessed alterations in their disease, pathological, and immunological conditions. Gene-expression results obtained from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (SLE mice) and CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (human SLE patients) were measured by DNA microarray and qRT-PCR. TOFA treatment resulted in reduced levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies, decreased proteinuria, and amelioration of nephritis as compared with those observed in control animals. Moreover, we observed the rebalance in the populations of na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and effector/memory cells in TOFA-treated mice; however, treatment with a combination of TOFA and dexamethasone (DEXA) elicited a stronger inhibitory effect toward the effector/memory cells than did TOFA or DEXA monotherapy. We also detected decreased expression of several IFN-signature genes Ifit3 and Isg15 in CD4<sup>+</sup> from SLE-prone mice following TOFA and DEXA treatment, and IFIT3 in CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells from human patients following immunosuppressant therapy including steroid, respectively.

We previously reported that DCs from female lupus-prone mice constitutively overexpress IFN-responsive genes resembling the IFN signature found in SLE patients. As SLE has higher incidence in women than men, more so in women of reproductive age, estrogens are suggested to affect lupus pathogenesis. We investigated the effects of sex and estrogens on the IFN signature in conventional GM-CSF-bone marrow-derived DCs (cDCs), from male and female Triple Congenic B6.NZM.<i>Sle1/Sle2/Sle3</i> (TCSle) lupus-prone mice or from wild-type C57BL/6 mice, generated with titrations of 17-beta-estradiol (E2). We found that cDCs from prediseased TCSle male mice express the IFN signature as female TCSle cDCs do. Estrogens are necessary but not sufficient to express this IFN signature, but high doses of E2 can compensate for other steroidal components. E2 stimulation, regardless of sex, modulates type I IFN-dependent and type I IFN-independent activation of cDCs in response to TLR stimulation. Finally, we found that TCSle cDCs from both sexes have elevated markers of immunometabolism and estrogens enhance the metabolic pathways in cDCs, suggesting a mechanistic link between estrogens, immunometabolism, and the IFN signature in lupus.",

Interferon type I (IFN-I) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SLE. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of the IFN-I signature and the contribution of cytosolic nucleic acid receptors to IFN-I activation in a cohort of primarily white cSLE patients. The IFN-I score (positive or negative), as a measure of IFN-I activation, was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) expression values of IFN-I signature genes (IFI44, IFI44L, IFIT1, Ly6e, MxA, IFITM1) in CD14+ monocytes of cSLE patients and healthy controls (HCs). Innate immune receptor expression was determined by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. To clarify the contribution of RNA-binding RIG-like receptors (RLRs) and DNA-binding receptors (DBRs) to IFN-I activation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients were treated with BX795, a TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) inhibitor blocking RLR and DBR pathways. The IFN-I signature was positive in 57% of cSLE patients and 15% of the HCs. Upregulated gene expression of TLR7, RLRs (IFIH1, DDX58, DDX60, DHX58) and DBRs (ZBP-1, IFI16) was observed in CD14+ monocytes of the IFN-I-positive cSLE patients. Additionally, RIG-I and ZBP-1 protein expression was upregulated in these cells. Spontaneous IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG) expression in PBMCs from cSLE patients was inhibited by a TBK1-blocker. IFN-I activation, assessed as ISG expression, in cSLE is associated with increased expression of TLR7, and RNA and DNA binding receptors, and these receptors contribute to IFN-I activation via TBK1 signaling. TBK1-blockers may therefore be a promising treatment target for SLE.",

Using an inducible degron system in avian cells, we find that AND-1 depletion is incompatible with proliferation, owing to cells accumulating in G2 with activated DNA damage checkpoint. Replication without AND-1 causes fork speed slow-down and accumulation of long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps at the replication fork junction, with these regions being converted to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in G2. Strikingly, resected forks and DNA damage accumulation in G2, but not fork slow-down, are reverted by treatment with mirin, an MRE11 nuclease inhibitor. Domain analysis of AND-1 further revealed that the HMG box is important for fast replication but not for proliferation, whereas conversely, the WD40 domain prevents fork resection and subsequent DSB-associated lethality. Thus, our findings uncover a fork protection function of AND-1/Ctf4 manifested via the WD40 domain that is essential for proliferation and averts genome instability.",

From January 2012 and October 2015, consecutive patients with PTMC with intermediate-risk to high-risk features who underwent RAI therapy were retrospectively included. The data about BRAF mutation status were also obtained. The association between clinicopathological characteristics and mutation was investigated. After a median follow-up of 40 months, the clinical response to RAI therapy was also compared between positive and negative mutation groups. A total of 236 patients were included, of whom 147 (62.3%) had positive mutation. The clinicopathological features did not show significant correlation with BRAF mutation status except the sex, extrathytoidal extension and T stage. Patients with PTMC with BRAF mutation showed an increased likelihood of having advanced T stage and extrathyroidal extension. In addition, this mutation did not affect the clinical outcome of RAI therapy. The status of BRAF mutation may not affect the clinical response to RAI therapy for patients with PTMC with intermediate-risk to high-risk features.

This research discussed the association of BRAF(V600E) mutation and NIS expression in PTC tissue and the clinical implications in RIA therapy. 134 PTC samples were collected between June 2013 and June 2014 from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College, and their clinical characteristics were analyzed. RT-PCR was used to detect the BRAF(V600E) mutation from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the NIS expression. IPP software was used to calculate the relative expression quantity of NIS. We found that there was no significant correlation between the absorbance (A) values of NIS and clinicopathologic features in these cases, even thyroid stimulating hormone. BRAF(V600E) mutation showed inhibitory effect on the NIS expression without statistically significant difference in all PTC cases (\u03b2=-0.0195, P=0.085), but in the subgroup without hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), BRAF(V600E) mutation could significantly inhibit the NIS expression (\u03b2=-0.0257, P=0.046).

The antitumor effects of combining LB-100 with RT were verified in vivo by using intracranial orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Pharmacologic PP2A inhibition with LB-100 prior to RT enhanced the radiosensitivity of meningioma cells and reduced survival fraction in clonogenic assays. LB-100 increased DNA double-strand breakage (measured by \u03b3-H2AX), mitotic catastrophe cell death, and G2/M cell cycle arrest in irradiated meningioma cells. Also, LB-100 decreased activation of STAT3 and expression of its downstream proteins. In vivo, LB-100 and RT combined treatment prolonged the survival of mice with xenografts compared to RT alone. Taken together, these results provide convincing preclinical data to support the use of LB-100 as a radiosensitizing agent for treatment of malignant meningioma. Its potential for clinical application deserves further investigation.",

When it is given at bedtime, it reaches plasma concentration approximately twice the level achieved by amantadine immediate release. Amantadine ER reduces the severity and duration of dyskinesia during the day, reduces OFF time and increases ON time without troublesome dyskinesia.

We collected consecutive PMCT data from January 2002 to December 2009 from three institutes where PMCT examinations are performed on a routine basis for deceased patients with unknown causes of death. A total of 19 cases were identified where PMCT revealed RAAAs. Ante-mortem clinical presentations, post-mortem external examinations, and peri-mortem ultrasonography findings were assessed for their diagnostic accuracy. The correct diagnosis based on the classic triad of shock, acute abdominal pain, and pulsatile abdominal mass was made in only one of 19 (5.3%) patients. Shock, acute abdominal pain, and abdominal swelling were found in five of 19 (26%) patients. Shock and acute abdominal pain or abdominal swelling were found in two of 19 (10%) patients. Ten of 19 (53%) patients only had shock. Peri-mortem ultrasonography was performed in seven of 19 patients; one was diagnosed with RAAA (14%). No patients had pre-mortem CT examinations. Post-mortem diagnosis of RAAA is difficult to make based on ante-mortem clinical presentation, post-mortem external examinations, or peri-mortem ultrasonography.

It is characterized by a classical clinical triad: alacrima, achalasia and adrenal insufficiency, the canonic symptoms that are associated with progressive peripheral neuropathy. Only a few cohorts have been reported. The objective of the present study was to characterize the various spectra of adrenal function in Triple-A patients. A retrospective clinical and biological monitoring of 14 patients (10 families) was done in a single multidisciplinary French center. All had <i>AAAS</i> gene sequenced and adrenal function evaluation. Nine different <i>AAAS</i> mutations were found, including one new mutation: c.755G&gt;C, p.(Trp252Ser). Regarding adrenal function, defects of the zona fasciculata and reticularis were demonstrated by increased basal ACTH levels and low DHEAS levels in all cases regardless of the degree of glucocorticoid deficiency. In contrast, mineralocorticoid function was always conserved: i.e., normal plasma renin level associated with normal aldosterone level. The main prognostic feature was exacerbation of neuropathy and cognitive disorders. These data suggest that, in Triple-A patients, adrenal function can be deficient, insufficient or compensated. In our cohort after the first decade of life, there does not appear to be any degradation of adrenal function over time. However, patients with compensated adrenal function should be informed and educated to manage a glucocorticoid replacement therapy in case of stressful conditions, with no need for systematic long-term treatment.",

Unlike other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members harboring the same mutation(s).

The clinical, biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious hyperpigmentation and delayed development. Neurological and autonomic features were present in a few patients, suggesting requirement of prolonged follow-up for these patients. A significant gap between the onset of symptoms and confirmatory diagnosis was noted, suggesting that a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing this disorder.

In the present paper, we report a Chinese mainland girl with Allgrove syndrome with mutations in the AAAS gene. The patient was a 7-year-old girl complained of coma and dark skin; she was treated as Addison disease for 2 years and had vomiting for 9 months before the second admission. Gene analysis was performed after extracting genomic DNA by amplification and sequencing of the specific fragments of AAA gene. The patient was confirmed to have adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5 years and 6 months. During the second hospitalization, she was found to have a remarkable brisk reflexion, bilateral optic nerve atrophy, alacrima and achalasia besides ACTH resistance. The girl was born to consanguineous parents. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having Allgrove syndrome. Mutation analysis revealed a novel homozygous deletion of a single G, c.771delG, in exon 8 of the AAAS gene. This frame shift mutation was predicted to create a premature stop codon at locus 290, p.R258GfsX33, leading to a truncated and non-functioning aladin protein. Both the parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The clinical manifestations and AAAS gene mutations analysis confirmed the diagnosis of Allgrove syndrome.

This property of detonation synthesized nanodiamonds is improved after carboxylation, which in turn influences changes in the hydrogen bond strength in water. The observed stability of h-cNDs in water and their antioxidant activity correlates with their protective effect on RBCs against \u03b3-irradiation.",

The healing action of the protons results from their damage on cancerous cell DNA. Despite established clinical use, the chemical mechanisms of PCT reactions at the molecular level remain elusive. This situation prevents a rational design of PCT that can maximize its therapeutic power and minimize its side effects. The incomplete characterization of PCT reactions is partially due to the health risks associated with experimental/clinical techniques applied to human subjects. To overcome this situation, we are conducting time-dependent and non-adiabatic computer simulations of PCT reactions with the electron nuclear dynamics (END) method. Herein, we present a review of our previous and new END research on three fundamental types of PCT reactions: water radiolysis reactions, proton-induced DNA damage and electron-induced DNA damage. These studies are performed on the computational prototypes: proton + H\u2082O clusters, proton + DNA/RNA bases and + cytosine nucleotide, and electron + cytosine nucleotide + H\u2082O. These simulations provide chemical mechanisms and dynamical properties of the selected PCT reactions in comparison with available experimental and alternative computational results.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28376128": "To elucidate microscopic details of proton cancer therapy (PCT), we apply the simplest-level electron nuclear dynamics (SLEND) method to H+ + (H2O)1-6 at ELab = 100 keV. These systems are computationally tractable prototypes to simulate water radiolysis reactions-i.e. the PCT processes that generate the DNA-damaging species against cancerous cells. To capture incipient bulk-water effects, ten (H2O)1-6 isomers are considered, ranging from quasi-planar/multiplanar (H2O)1-6 to \"smallest-drop\" prism and cage (H2O)6 structures. SLEND is a time-dependent, variational, non-adiabatic and direct method that adopts a nuclear classical-mechanics description and an electronic single-determinantal wavefunction in the Thouless representation. Short-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1-6) and /6-31G** (n = 1-5) simulations render cluster-to-projectile 1-electron-transfer (1-ET) total integral cross sections (ICSs) and 1-ET probabilities. In absolute quantitative terms, SLEND/6-31G* 1-ET ICS compares satisfactorily with alternative experimental and theoretical results only available for n = 1 and exhibits almost the same accuracy of the best alternative theoretical result. SLEND/6-31G** overestimates 1-ET ICS for n = 1, but a comparable overestimation is also observed with another theoretical method. An investigation on H+ + H indicates that electron direct ionization (DI) becomes significant with the large virtual-space quasi-continuum in large basis sets; thus, SLEND/6-31G** 1-ET ICS is overestimated by DI contributions. The solution to this problem is discussed. In relative quantitative terms, both SLEND/6-31* and /6-31G** 1-ET ICSs precisely fit into physically justified scaling formulae as a function of the cluster size; this indicates SLEND's suitability for predicting properties of water clusters with varying size. Long-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1-4) simulations predict the formation of the DNA-damaging radicals H, OH, O and H3O. While \"smallest-drop\" isomers are included, no early manifestations of bulk water PCT properties are observed and simulations with larger water clusters will be needed to capture those effects. This study is the largest SLEND investigation on water radiolysis to date.",

ADS-5102 is an extended release amantadine capsule formulation, designed for once-daily dosing at bedtime (qhs) to provide high concentrations upon waking and throughout the day, with lower concentrations in the evening. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADS-5102 were assessed in two phase I studies in healthy subjects, and a blinded, randomized phase II/III dose-finding study in PD patients. The first phase I study assessed single ADS-5102 doses (68.5, 137, and 274 mg) in a crossover design, whereas the second phase I study evaluated ADS-5102 137 mg for 7 days followed by amantadine IR 81 mg twice daily (or reverse order). In the phase II/III double-blind study, PD patients with dyskinesia were randomized to ADS-5102 (210, 274, or 338 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks. Single ADS-5102 doses resulted in a slow initial rise in amantadine plasma concentration, with delayed time to maximum concentration (12-16 h). Amantadine plasma concentrations were higher in PD patients versus healthy volunteers. The steady-state profile of once-daily ADS-5102 was significantly different from that of twice-daily amantadine IR, such that the two formulations are not bioequivalent. PK modeling suggested the recommended daily ADS-5102 dosage (274 mg qhs) resulted in 1.4- to 2.0-fold higher amantadine plasma concentrations during the day versus amantadine IR. ADS-5102 can be administered once-daily qhs to achieve high amantadine plasma concentrations in the morning and throughout the day, when symptoms of dyskinesia occur.",

The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with 4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65 or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models have a higher sensitivity rate compared to the sensitivity of the LACE index. The C statistic values of the model applied to both populations demonstrate moderate levels of predictive power. The authors also build an economic model to demonstrate the potential financial impact of the use of the model for targeting high-risk patients in a sample hospital and demonstrate that, on balance, whether the hospital gains or loses from reducing readmissions depends on its margin and the extent of its readmission penalties.",

The use of a prediction model to quantify a patient's risk of readmission may assist in directing interventions to patients who will benefit most. The objective of this study was to calculate the rate of 30-day readmissions and evaluate the accuracy of the LACE index (length of stay, acuity of admission, co-morbidities, and emergency department visits within the last 6 months) for 30-day readmissions in a general hospital population of COPD patients. All patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of COPD to Liverpool Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia, between 2006 and 2016 were included in the study. A LACE index score was calculated for each patient and assessed using receiver operator characteristic curves. During the study period, 2,662 patients had 5,979 hospitalizations for COPD. Four percent of patients died in hospital and 25% were readmitted within 30 days; 56% of all 30-day readmissions were again due to COPD. The most common reasons for readmission, following COPD, were heart failure, pneumonia, and chest pain. The LACE index had moderate discriminative ability to predict 30-day readmission (<i>C</i>-statistic =0.63). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was 25% following hospitalization for COPD in an Australian tertiary hospital and as such comparable to international published rates.

A prospective study was conducted among all general medicine inpatients within a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia between February to April 2016, with risk screening using the revised LACE index, alongside abbreviated mental test and clinical frailty scale testing, with high-risk patients (revised LACE \u2265 8) offered specialist clinic appointment and/or referral to community services. Among 781 patients (873 admission episodes), 358 (41.0%) admission episodes were classified as high risk of early readmission. Revised LACE index scores were equivalent for readmission vs. non-readmission episodes, {median 7 [interquartile range (IQR) 5, 8] vs. 7 [IQR 4, 8])}, as were median abbreviated mental test (8 [IQR 6, 9] vs. 8 [IQR 6, 9]) and clinical frailty scale scores (5 [IQR 3, 6] vs. 5 [IQR 3, 6]). Early readmission rates were equivalent for those who received compared with did not receive RAPT intervention (14.3 vs. 14.7%), albeit confounded by lack of identification of readmission risk using the revised LACE index. A total of 53 (14.8%) of the 358 high-risk admission episodes formally declined RAPT follow-up. This study highlighted the complexities of addressing hospital readmissions, with challenges in identifying those at risk, and low uptake and impact of current intervention strategies.

We investigated the impact of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) on all cause 30-day hospital readmission retrospectively in an academic centre. We study the eligible cohort of 1781 discharges over 2-year period. Data on age, gender, diagnoses, 30-day hospital readmission, discharge medications and variables in the HOSPITAL score (Haemoglobin level at discharge, Oncology at discharge, Sodium level at discharge, Procedure during hospitalisation, Index admission, number of hospital Admissions, Length of stay) and LACE index (Length of stay, Acute/emergent admission, Charlson comorbidity index score, Emergency department visits in previous 6 months), which have higher predictability for readmission were extracted and matched for analysis. Warfarin was the most common anticoagulant prescribed at discharge (273 patients) with a readmission rate of 20% (p&lt;0.01). DOACs were used by 94 patients at discharge with a readmission rate of 4% (p=0.219). Multivariate logistic regression showed an increased risk of readmission with warfarin therapy (OR 1.36, p=0.045). Logistic regression did not show DOACs to be a risk factor for hospital readmission. Our data suggests that warfarin therapy is a risk factor for all-cause 30-day hospital readmission.

To accurately adjust for risk and to allow for interhospital comparisons of readmission rates, we used administrative data to derive and internally validate an extension of the LACE index, a previously validated index for 30-day death or urgent readmission. We randomly selected 500 000 medical and surgical patients discharged to the community from any Ontario hospital between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2009. We derived a logistic regression model on 250 000 randomly selected patients from this group and modified the final model into an index scoring system, the LACE+ index. We internally validated the LACE+ index using data from the remaining 250 000 patients and compared its performance with that of the original LACE index. Within 30 days of discharge to the community, 33 825 (6.8%) of the patients had died or had been urgently readmitted. In addition to the variables included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded that of the LACE index. The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population.

Admissions and readmissions for patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial neoplasm at a single multihospital academic medical center were analyzed. All brain tumor cases for which the patient was alive at 30 days after surgery were included (n = 352). Simple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the ability of the LACE+ index and subsequent single variables to accurately predict the outcome measures of 30-day readmission, reoperation, and ED visit. Analysis of the model's or variable's discrimination was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve as represented by the C-statistic. The sample included admissions for craniotomy for supratentorial neoplasm (n = 352).

Despite this, analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve indicates that LACE+ index has poor specificity in predicting 30-day readmission (C-statistic = 0.58).

Forty-nine patients (50%) received a GI cocktail for a chief complaint of abdominal pain and 40 (41%) for a chief complaint of chest pain. The reason for administration of a GI cocktail was documented on only one chart. Sixty-six patients (68%) received at least one other drug, at a median time of 9 minutes before administration of the GI cocktail. The most commonly coadministered drug was a narcotic (56 patients), followed by nitroglycerin (22 patients), antiemetics (13 patients), H2-blockers (13 patients), and aspirin (10 patients). Thirty-three patients (34%) had symptomatic relief with the cocktail alone, 35 (36%) had symptomatic relief with the cocktail plus other drugs, 7 (7%) had no response to the GI cocktail alone, and 5 (5%) had no response to the cocktail with other drugs. In 17 patients (18%) the response was not documented. Chest pain patients and abdominal pain patients had a similar frequency of response. There was also similarity of response between admitted and discharged patients.

Here, we describe a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5 promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that GRG5 has pleiotropic roles in stem cell biology functioning as a stemness factor and a neural fate specifier.",

There is a disparity between research results and observed empirical effects seen in human astronaut crews, likely due to the numerous factors that limit terrestrial simulation of the complex space environment and extrapolation of human clinical consequences from varied animal models. Given the intended future of human spaceflight, with efforts now to rapidly expand capabilities for human missions to the moon and Mars, there is a pressing need to improve upon the understanding of the space radiation risk, predict likely clinical outcomes of interplanetary radiation exposure, and develop appropriate and effective mitigation strategies for future missions. To achieve this goal, the space radiation and aerospace community must recognize the historical limitations of radiation research and how such limitations could be addressed in future research endeavors. We have sought to highlight the numerous factors that limit understanding of the risk of space radiation for human crews and to identify ways in which these limitations could be addressed for improved understanding and appropriate risk posture regarding future human spaceflight.",

Medical therapy is often the first line of management for women with endometriosis in order to ameliorate symptoms or to prevent post-surgical disease recurrence. Currently, there are several medical options for the management of patients with endometriosis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, being efficacious in relieving primary dysmenorrhea. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and progestins, available for multiple routes of administration, are effective first-line hormonal options. In fact, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that they succeed in improving pain symptoms in the majority of patients, are well tolerated and not expensive. Second-line therapy is represented by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Even if these drugs are efficacious in treating women not responding to COCs or progestins, they are not orally available and have a less favorable tolerability profile (needing an appropriate add-back therapy). The use of danazol is limited by the large availability of other better-tolerated hormonal drugs. Because few data are available on long-term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors they should be administered only in women with symptoms refractory to other conventional therapies in a clinical research setting.

As the degree of ovarian suppression obtained with elagolix is dose-dependent, pain relief may be achieved by modulating the level of hypo-oestrogenism while limiting side effects. Elagolix may thus be considered a novelty in terms of its endocrine and pharmacological properties but not for its impact on the pathogenic mechanisms of endometriosis, as the target of this new drug is, yet again, alteration of the hormonal milieu. Given the oestrogen-dependent nature of endometriosis, a reduction of side effects may imply a proportionate decrease in pain relief. Furthermore, if low elagolix doses are used, ovulation is not consistently inhibited, and patients should use non-hormonal contraceptive systems and perform serial urine pregnancy tests to rule out unplanned conception during periods of treatment-induced amenorrhoea. If high elagolix doses are used to control severe pain for long periods of time, add-back therapies should be added, similar to that prescribed when using GnRH agonists. To date, the efficacy of elagolix has only been demonstrated in placebo-controlled explanatory trials. Pragmatic trials comparing elagolix with low-dose hormonal contraceptives and progestogens should be planned to verify the magnitude of the incremental benefit, if any, of this GnRH antagonist over currently used standard treatments. The price of elagolix may impact on patient adherence and, hence, on clinical effectiveness. In the USA, the manufacturer AbbVie Inc. priced elagolix (OrilissaTM) at around $10 000 a year, i.e. $845 per month. When faced with unaffordable treatments, some patients may choose to forego care. If national healthcare systems are funded by the tax payer, the approval and the use of a new costly drug to treat a chronic condition, such as endometriosis, means that some finite financial resources will be diverted from other areas, or that similar patients will not receive the same level of care. Thus, defining the overall 'value' of a new drug for endometriosis also has ethical implications, and trade-offs between health outcomes and costs should be carefully weighed up.",

This was a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose study with sequential dose escalation. Fifty-five healthy, regularly cycling premenopausal women participated. Subjects were administered a single oral dose of 25-400 mg or placebo. In a second arm of the study, subjects received placebo or 50, 100, or 200 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily for 7 d. Treatment was initiated on d 7 (+/-1) after onset of menses. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and serum LH, FSH, and estradiol concentrations were assessed. Elagolix was well tolerated and rapidly bioavailable after oral administration. Serum gonadotropins declined rapidly. Estradiol was suppressed by 24 h in subjects receiving at least 50 mg/d. Daily (50-200 mg) or twice-daily (100 mg) administration for 7 d maintained low estradiol levels (17 +/- 3 to 68 +/- 46 pg/ml) in most subjects during late follicular phase. Effects of the compound were rapidly reversed after discontinuation.

The two primary efficacy end points were the proportion of women who had a clinical response with respect to dysmenorrhea and the proportion who had a clinical response with respect to nonmenstrual pelvic pain at 3 months. Each of these end points was measured as a clinically meaningful reduction in the pain score and a decreased or stable use of rescue analgesic agents, as recorded in a daily electronic diary.

Several new studies added important insights on apoC-III and its physiological function confirming its promise as a valid therapeutic target. APOC3 is expressed in liver and intestine and regulates triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) catabolism and anabolism. The transcriptional regulation in both organs requires different regulatory elements. Clinical and preclinical studies established that apoC-III raises plasma triglyceride levels predominantly by inhibiting hepatic TRL clearance. Mechanistic insights into missense variants indicate accelerated renal clearance of apoC-III variants resulting in enhanced TRL catabolism. In contrast, an APOC3 gain-of-function variant enhances de novo lipogenesis and hepatic TRL production. Multiple studies confirmed the correlation between increased apoC-III levels and cardiovascular disease. This has opened up new therapeutic avenues allowing targeting of specific apoC-III properties in triglyceride metabolism. Novel in vivo models and APOC3 missense variants revealed unique mechanisms by which apoC-III inhibits TRL catabolism. Clinical trials with Volanesorsen, an APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide, report very promising lipid-lowering outcomes.

A random-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A weighted random-effects meta-regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounders on glycemic parameters. This meta-analysis comprising 2062 subjects showed a significant reduction of apo C-III concentrations following treatment with omega-3 (WMD: -22.18 mg/L, 95% confidence interval: -31.61, -12.75, p &lt; .001; I<sup>2</sup>: 88.24%). Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction of plasma apo C-III concentrations by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl esters but not omega-3 carboxylic acids or omega-3 ethyl esters. There was a greater apo C-III reduction with only EPA as compared with supplements containing EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or only DHA. A positive association between the apo C-III-lowering effect of omega-3 with baseline apo C-III concentrations and treatment duration was found.

Recent data strongly suggest that elevated TG-rich lipoproteins are an independent risk factor for CVD and that therapeutic targeting of them could possibly provide further benefit in reducing CVD morbidity, events and mortality, apart from LDL-C lowering. Today elevated TGs are treated with lifestyle interventions, and with fibrates which could be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. There are also some new drugs. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and it seems that it can substantially lower elevated TGs levels because ANGPTL3 also regulates TGs metabolism. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator which also decreases TGs, and improves other lipid parameters. It seems that it also has some other possible antiatherogenic effects. Alipogene tiparvovec is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral vector that delivers copies of the LPL gene to muscle tissue which accelerates the clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins thus decreasing extremely high TGs levels. Pradigastat is a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor which substantially reduces extremely high TGs levels and appears to be promising in treatment of the rare familial chylomicronemia syndrome.",

Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia - they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic. Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events, beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others. However, CVD outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have produced inconsistent results, meaning that no convincing evidence is available that lowering triglycerides by any approach can reduce mortality.",

ApoCIII gain-of-function mutations are associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD), and contribute to the development of cardiometabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in ApoCIII are associated with lower levels of plasma triglycerides (TG), attenuation of vascular inflammatory processes such as monocyte adhesion and endothelial dysfunction, and potentially, a reduction in the incidence and progression of atherosclerosis and cardioprotection. Evidence is now emerging that volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide drug targeting ApoCIII messenger RNA resulting in decreases in TG in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic dyslipidemia with type 2 diabetes giving support to the hypothesis that ApoCIII is a powerful inhibitor of LPL, and when reduced, endogenous clearance of TRLs can result in substantial reductions in TG levels.

Treatment with volanesorsen significantly reduced plasma apoC-III (-88%, P = 0.02) and TG (-69%, P = 0.02) levels and raised HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (42%, P = 0.03) compared with placebo. These changes were accompanied by a 57% improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.001). Importantly, we found a strong relationship between enhanced insulin sensitivity and both plasma apoC-III (r = -0.61, P = 0.03) and TG (r = -0.68, P = 0.01) suppression.

FCS is associated with severe morbidity that includes recurrent pancreatitis and other problems. Effective treatment to reliably prevent complications has been unavailable, so there is a quest to identify novel interventions to achieve sustained triglyceride lowering and prevention of pancreatitis. Apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-CIII) interferes with triglyceride clearance by blocking LPL and alternative pathways. Volanesorsen is an experimental antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits translation of Apo-CIII mRNA, thereby substantially lowering plasma levels of Apo-CIII and triglycerides. It is being developed for treatment of patients with FCS and refractory hypertriglyceridemia. Data from a variety of clinical trials have been very encouraging, with documentation of excellent triglyceride-lowering efficacy, but there have been concerns about the risk of drug-related thrombocytopenia and bleeding that contributed to the recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to not approve the drug for clinical use. Clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of volanesorsen are ongoing, so there is hope that the drug ultimately will be approved and available for treatment of high-risk patients with FCS.",

Here, the authors measured an unprecedented range of apolipoproteins in a prospective, population-based study and relate their plasma levels to risk of CVD. This study sought to measure apolipoproteins directly by mass spectrometry and compare their associations with incident CVD and to obtain a system-level understanding of the correlations of apolipoproteins with the plasma lipidome and proteome. Associations of 13 apolipoproteins, 135 lipid species, and 211 other plasma proteins with incident CVD (91 events), defined as stroke, myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death, were assessed prospectively over a 10-year period in the Bruneck Study (N = 688) using multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Changes in apolipoprotein and lipid levels following treatment with volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense drug targeting apoC-III, were determined in 2 human intervention trials, one of which was randomized. The apolipoproteins most significantly associated with incident CVD were apoC-II (hazard ratio per 1 SD [HR/SD]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17 to 1.67), apoC-III (HR/SD: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.63), and apoE (HR/SD: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.52). Associations were independent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and non-HDL cholesterol, and extended to stroke and myocardial infarction. Lipidomic and proteomic profiles implicated these 3 very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated apolipoproteins in de novo lipogenesis, glucose metabolism, complement activation, blood coagulation, and inflammation. Notably, apoC-II/apoC-III/apoE correlated with a pattern of lipid species previously linked to CVD risk. ApoC-III inhibition by volanesorsen reduced plasma levels of apoC-II, apoC-III, triacylglycerols, and diacylglycerols, and increased apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoM (all p &lt; 0.05 vs. placebo) without affecting apoB-100 (p = 0.73).

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as a principal alternative to microresection for small- and medium-sized CSHs. Resection is a reasonable option for large (3-4 cm in diameter) and giant (&gt; 4 cm in diameter) CSHs. However, management of giant CSHs remains a challenge for neurosurgeons because of the high rates of morbidity and even death that stem from uncontrollable and massive hemorrhage during surgery. The authors report here the results of their study on the use of hypofractionated SRS (H-SRS) to treat giant CSH. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2014, 31 patients with a giant CSH (tumor volume &gt; 40 cm<sup>3</sup>, &gt; 4 cm in diameter) treated using CyberKnife radiosurgery were enrolled in a cohort study. Clinical status and targeted reduction of tumor volume were evaluated by means of serial MRI. The diagnosis for 27 patients was determined on the basis of typical imaging features. In 4 patients, the diagnosis of CSH was confirmed histopathologically. The median CSH volume was 64.4 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 40.9-145.3 cm<sup>3</sup>). Three or 4 sessions of CyberKnife radiosurgery were used with a prescription dose based on the intent to cover the entire tumor with a higher dose while ensuring dose limitation to the visual pathways and brainstem. The median marginal dose to the tumor was 21 Gy (range 19.5-21 Gy) in 3 fractions for 11 patients and 22 Gy (range 18-22 Gy) in 4 fractions for 20 patients. RESULTS The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 6-78 months) for all patients. Follow-up MRI scans revealed a median tumor volume reduction of 88.1% (62.3%-99.4%) at last examination compared with the pretreatment volume. Ten patients developed new or aggravated temporary headache and 5 experienced vomiting during the treatment; these acute symptoms were relieved completely after steroid administration. Among the 30 patients with symptoms observed before treatment, 19 achieved complete symptomatic remission, and 11 had partial remission. One patient reported seizures, which were controlled after antiepileptic drug administration. No radiation-induced neurological deficits or delayed complications were reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Hypofractionated SRS was an effective and safe modality for treating giant CSH. Considering the risks involved with microsurgery, it is possible that H-SRS might be able to serve as a definitive primary treatment option for giant CSH.",

It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms.

Studies have shown the median duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer among those receiving niraparib than among those receiving placebo, regardless of presence or absence of BRCA gene mutations or homologous recombination deficiency status. Studies have shown that treatment-emergent Grade 3 or Grade 4 hematological events were observed in patients receiving niraparib including thrombocytopenia (33.8%), anemia (25.3%) and neutropenia (19.6%). Most of the hematological laboratory abnormalities occurred within the first three treatment cycles. After dose adjustment, the incidence of hematological abnormalities was infrequent beyond cycle 3. We are reporting two cases of Grade III/IV neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in patients treated with niraparib in our institution. Unfortunately, one of the patients succumbed to septic shock secondary to right lower lobe pneumonia while severely neutropenic. The second patient's blood counts improved after discontinuing the medication and with supportive transfusions during the hospitalization.",

We sought to evaluate the efficacy of niraparib versus placebo as maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer. In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCA cohort and non-gBRCA cohort) and the type of non-gBRCA mutation and were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo once daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Of 553 enrolled patients, 203 were in the gBRCA cohort (with 138 assigned to niraparib and 65 to placebo), and 350 patients were in the non-gBRCA cohort (with 234 assigned to niraparib and 116 to placebo). Patients in the niraparib group had a significantly longer median duration of progression-free survival than did those in the placebo group, including 21.0 vs. 5.5 months in the gBRCA cohort (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 0.41), as compared with 12.9 months vs. 3.8 months in the non-gBRCA cohort for patients who had tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.59) and 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months in the overall non-gBRCA cohort (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61; P&lt;0.001 for all three comparisons).

Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited. Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.

FRAXA (FMR1) trinucleotide expansion is widely searched in routine screening, but found in only about 2% of the patients tested. Mutations of the MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein) gene mainly cause Rett syndrome but were also shown to be involved in mental retardation. This study aimed to estimate the frequency of MECP2 gene mutations in a large group of mentally retarded patients without FRAXA expansion. Screening by heteroduplex analysis and SSCP followed by DNA sequencing of shifted bands were performed on 613 patients, including 442 males and 171 females. Eleven sequence variants were found, including nine polymorphisms. The two others may be pathogenetic. The first one, the double nucleotide substitution c.1162_1163delinsTA leading to a premature stop codon (p.Pro388X) was found in a female patient with random X-inactivation, presenting with borderline mental impairment without any features of Rett syndrome. The second one, the c.679C&gt;G substitution, changing a glutamine to a glutamate in the transcriptional repression functional domain (p.Gln227Glu), was found in a female patient with a moderately biased X-chromosome inactivation profile and presenting with mild intellectual delay and minor psychotic features. The low mutation rate suggests that a large-scale routine screening for MECP2 in mentally retarded subjects is not cost-effective in clinical practice.

These escape genes have been reported to be under stronger purifying selection than other X-linked genes. Although it is known that escape from X-inactivation is much more common in humans than in mice, systematic assays of escape in humans have to date employed only interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Here we provide the first systematic next-generation sequencing analysis of escape in a human cell line. We analyzed RNA and genotype sequencing data obtained from B lymphocyte cell lines derived from Europeans (CEU) and Yorubans (YRI). By replicated detection of heterozygosis in the transcriptome, we identified 114 escaping genes, including 76 not previously known to be escapees. The newly described escape genes cluster on the X chromosome in the same chromosomal regions as the previously known escapees. There is an excess of escaping genes associated with mental retardation, consistent with this being a common phenotype of polyX phenotypes. We find both differences between populations and between individuals in the propensity to escape. Indeed, we provide the first evidence for there being both hyper- and hypo-escapee females in the human population, consistent with the highly variable phenotypic presentation of polyX karyotypes. Considering also prior data, we reclassify genes as being always, never, and sometimes escape genes.

Here we demonstrate that mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting elements are trafficked through nuclear speckles. Although ALREX-promoting elements enhance nuclear speckle localization, additional features within the mRNA largely drive this process. Depletion of two TREX-associated RNA helicases, UAP56 and its paralog URH49, or inhibition of the TREX-associated nuclear transport factor, TAP, not only inhibits ALREX, but also appears to trap these mRNAs in nuclear speckles. mRNAs that contain ALREX-promoting elements associate with UAP56 in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that mRNAs lacking a poly(A)-tail are not efficiently exported by the ALREX pathway and show enhanced association with nuclear speckles. Our data suggest that within the speckle, ALREX-promoting elements, in conjunction with the poly(A)-tail, likely stimulate UAP56/URH49 and TAP dependent steps that lead to the eventual egress of the export-competent mRNP from these structures.",

Monochloramine (NH2Cl), a cell-permeant ROM, is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins. They play important roles in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Currently, little is known about the link between inflammatory stimulation and the pre-mRNA splicing process, although gene expression is changed in inflamed tissues. The present study was designed to investigate whether stimulation of human colonic epithelial cells (HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines) with NH2Cl affects nuclear speckles and their components. By indirect immunofluorescence, nuclear speckles have been shown to undergo rapid aggregation after NH2Cl stimulation. By utilizing Western blotting, SRp30 (a subset of SR proteins) in intestinal epithelial cells was found to be phosphorylated after NH2Cl treatment, whereas other SR proteins were not responsive to NH2Cl stimulation. The cytotoxic effect of NH2Cl was excluded by both negative lactate dehydrogenase assay and propidium iodide staining. Therefore, NH2Cl-induced morphological changes on nuclear speckles and phosphorylated SRp30 do not result from intestinal epithelial injury. Furthermore, the effect of NH2Cl on nuclear speckles and SRp30 was blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I, a selective PKC inhibitor. Together, the available data suggest that stimulation of intestinal epithelial cells with NH2Cl results in a consequent change on pre-mRNA splicing machinery via a distinctive signal pathway involving activation of PKC. This effect may contribute to oxidant-induced pathophysiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Here we show that C3G localizes to SC35-positive nuclear speckles and regulates splicing activity. Reversible association of C3G with speckles was seen on inhibition of transcription and splicing. C3G shows partial colocalization with SC35 and is recruited to a chromatin and RNase-sensitive fraction of speckles. Its presence in speckles is dependent on intact cellular actin cytoskeleton and is lost on expression of the kinase Clk1. Rap1, a substrate of C3G, is also present in nuclear speckles, and inactivation of Rap signaling by expression of GFP-Rap1GAP alters speckle morphology and number. Enhanced association of C3G with speckles is seen on glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibition or differentiation of C2C12 cells to myotubes. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of C3G resulted in altered splicing activity of an artificial gene as well as endogenous CD44. C3G knockout clones of C2C12 as well as MDA-MB-231 cells showed reduced protein levels of several splicing factors compared with control cells.

Despite widespread expression and involvement in human diseases, DNAJC17 function is still poorly understood. Herein, we have investigated its function through high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. DNAJC17-depleted cells transcriptome highlighted genes involved in general functional categories, mainly related to gene expression. Conversely, DNAJC17 interactome can be classified in very specific functional networks, with the most enriched one including proteins involved in splicing. Furthermore, several splicing-related interactors, were independently validated by co-immunoprecipitation and in vivo co-localization. Accordingly, co-localization of DNAJC17 with SC35, a marker of nuclear speckles, further supported its interaction with spliceosomal components. Lastly, DNAJC17 up-regulation enhanced splicing efficiency of minigene reporter in live cells, while its knockdown induced perturbations of splicing efficiency at whole genome level, as demonstrated by specific analysis of RNAseq data. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests a role of DNAJC17 in splicing-related processes and provides support to its recognized essential function in early development.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032211": "A significant fraction of mRNAs are degraded by the nuclear exosome in normal cells. Here, we studied where and when these exosome target mRNAs are sorted away from properly exported ones in the cells. We show that upon exosome inactivation, polyA RNAs are apparently accumulated in nuclear foci that are distinct from nuclear speckles (NSs), and provide several lines of evidence supporting that these polyA RNAs mainly correspond to accumulating exosome target mRNAs. These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs. In support of this possibility, targeting exosome target mRNAs to NSs stabilizes them by preventing exosomal degradation. Furthermore, inhibiting mRNA release from NSs does not attenuate exosomal degradation in normal cells, and results in polyA RNA accumulation both inside and outside of NSs in exosome inactivated cells, suggesting that passage through NSs is not required for sorting mRNAs for degradation or export. Indeed, exosome target mRNAs that normally do not enter NSs are exported upon exosome inactivation. Together, our data suggest that exosome target mRNAs are mainly degraded in the nucleoplasm before entering NSs and rapid removal of these mRNAs is important for preventing their nuclear export.",

In this study, we unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export. Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear pores, is not. Upon NXF1 depletion, the TREX protein UAP56 loses speckle concentration but coaccumulates with intronless mRNAs and polyA RNAs in the nucleoplasm, and these RNAs are trapped in NSs upon UAP56 codepletion. We propose that the export-competent messenger RNP assembly mainly occurs in NSs for intronless mRNAs and that entering NSs serves as a quality control step in mRNA export.",

Genes involved in DNA conformation maintenance are suppressed upon senescence entry across all cell types. We show that nuclear depletion of the abundant HMGB2 protein occurs early on the path to senescence and coincides with the dramatic spatial clustering of CTCF. Knocking down HMGB2 suffices for senescence-induced CTCF clustering and for loop reshuffling, while ectopically expressing HMGB2 rescues these effects.

By the calorie restriction, the incidence of myeloid leukemia was significantly decreased. In addition, the latent period of the myeloid leukemia in the groups for calorie restriction was significantly extended at a greater extent as compared with the control diet groups.

An earlier biologically based model that was designed to estimate risks of high-dose radiation-induced solid cancers included initiation of stem cells to a premalignant state, inactivation of stem cells at high radiation doses, and proliferation of stem cells during cellular repopulation after inactivation. This earlier model predicted the risks of solid tumors induced by radiation therapy but overestimated the corresponding leukemia risks. To extend the model to radiation-induced leukemias, we analyzed--in addition to cellular initiation, inactivation, and proliferation--a repopulation mechanism specific to the hematopoietic system: long-range migration through the blood stream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from distant locations. Parameters for the model were derived from HSC biologic data in the literature and from leukemia risks among atomic bomb survivors who were subjected to much lower radiation doses. Proliferating HSCs that migrate from sites distant from the high-dose region include few preleukemic HSCs, thus decreasing the high-dose leukemia risk. The extended model for leukemia provides risk estimates that are consistent with epidemiologic data for leukemia risk associated with radiation therapy over a wide dose range. For example, when applied to an earlier case-control study of 110,000 women undergoing radiotherapy for uterine cancer, the model predicted an excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.9 for leukemia among women who received a large inhomogeneous fractionated external beam dose to the bone marrow (mean = 14.9 Gy), consistent with the measured ERR (2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2 to 6.4; from 3.6 cases expected and 11 cases observed). As a corresponding example for brachytherapy, the predicted ERR of 0.80 among women who received an inhomogeneous low-dose-rate dose to the bone marrow (mean = 2.5 Gy) was consistent with the measured ERR (0.62, 95% CI = -0.2 to 1.9). An extended, biologically based model for leukemia that includes HSC initiation, inactivation, proliferation, and, uniquely for leukemia, long-range HSC migration predicts, with reasonable accuracy, risks for radiation-induced leukemia associated with exposure to therapeutic doses of radiation.",

Dance, added to drug therapy, can help treating these patients AIMS: To conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis with the aim to analyze the effects of dance classes in comparison to other interventions or to the absence of intervention, in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), on functional mobility, motor symptoms and QL of PD patients METHODS: The search was conducted in MEDLINE, LILACS, SciELO, Cochrane and PsycINFO (last searched in August 2017). RCTs analyzing dance effects in comparison to other physical training types or to no intervention, on functional mobility, motor symptoms and QL of PD patients were selected. The outcomes assessed were motor symptoms with Unified PD Rating Scale III (UPDRSIII), functional mobility with Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), endurance with 6 min walking test (6MWT), freezing of gait with Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG_Q), walking velocity with GAITRite and QL with PD Questionnaire (PDQ39). Two reviewers independently extracted methodological quality and studies data. Results are presented as weighted mean differences. Five RCTs were included, totaling 159 patients. Dance promoted significant improvements on UPDRSIII, and a decrease in TUG time when compared to other types of exercise. In comparison to the absence of intervention, dance practice also showed significant improvements in motor scores. Dance can improve motor parameters of the disease and patients' functional mobility.",

In total, 136 patients with PD from 27 movement disorder centres of university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. They were assessed using SCOPA, Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2), Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (NOHQ), and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire (RBDQ). The test-retest reliability was assessed over a time interval of 10-14 days. The internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1-coefficients) of K-SCOPA-S was 0.88 for nighttime sleep (NS) and 0.75 for daytime sleepiness (DS). Test-retest reliability was 0.88 and 0.85 for the NS and DS, respectively. There was a moderate correlation between the NS sub-score and PDSS-2 total score. The NS and DS sub-scores of K-SCOPA-S were correlated with motor scale such as HYS, and non-motor scales such as UPDRS I, UPDRS II, MADS, NMSS, PDQ39, and NOHQ while the DS sub-score was with RBDQ. The K-SCOPA-S exhibited good reliability and validity for the assessment of sleep problems in the Korean patients with PD.",

They may appear in early pre-symptomatic stage as well as throughout the disease course. However, their relationship with the deterioration of the patient's quality of life (QoL) is still under debate. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of NMSs and their impact on the QoL in a cohort of Moroccan patients. We carried out a cross-transactional study, where a total of 117 patients were submitted to a structured clinical interview and examination investigating motor and NMSs based on common and conventional scales. Motor symptoms were assessed by the UPDRS I-VI during ON condition. The NMSs were evaluated with common scales and their relationship with the QoL was investigated. The mean patient's age was 60.77 \u00b1 11.36 years old, and the median disease duration was 6 years [2.5-9.5]. Motor's phenotype subtypes were the mixed form in 40.2% of patients, akinetic-rigid in 20.5% and a tremor-dominant form in 39.3%. The median Hoehn and Yahr staging was 2 [1-2.5]. Regarding NMSs, the most common were urinary dysfunctions (82.6%), sleep (80.6%), and gastrointestinal (80%) disorders. Other autonomic dysfunctions were also frequent: thermoregulatory dysfunctions 58.6%, cardiovascular troubles 50.9%, and sexual dysfunctions 47.9%. Depression was present in 47.9% and fatigue symptoms in 23.1%. The median score of SCOPA-AUT was 14 [7.75-21.80]. The median PD questionnaire 39-score index (PDQ39-SI) was 23.22% and the most affected dimension was \"mobility.\" Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the SCOPA-AUT score impacted the QoL (<i>p</i> = 0.001), especially the gastrointestinal (<i>p</i> = 0.007), and cardiovascular (<i>p</i> = 0.049) dimensions. Our data show that all patients have presented at least one NMS. Autonomic and sleep disorders were the most frequent, and in contrast to other studies, digestive and cardiovascular disorders were rather the factors influencing negatively the QoL of patients. Understanding the pathophysiology of these NMSs should be placed at the forefront in order to develop new therapeutic approaches by improving the QoL of PD patients.",

Objective measurement of motor function is available for Parkinson's Disease (PD), making it possible to optimise therapy and clinical outcomes. In this study, an accelerometry based measurement and predefined target ranges were used to assess motor function in a Northern Tasmania PD cohort managed by a Movement Disorder clinic. Approximately 40% (<i>n</i> = 103) of the total PD population participated in this study and motor scores were within target in 22%. In the 78% above target, changes in oral therapy were recommended in 74%, Advanced Therapy in 12% and treatment was contraindicated in 9%. Following changes in oral therapy, there was a further objective measurement and clinical consultation to establish whether scores had reached target range: if so subjects left the study, otherwise further changes of therapy were recommended (unless contraindications were present). Seventy-seven cases completed the study, with 48% achieving target (including 22% at outset), Advanced Therapy recommended in 19% and contraindications preventing any change in therapy in 17%. In the 43% of cases in whom oral therapy was changed, total UPDRS improved significantly (effect size = 8) as did the PDQ39 in cases reaching target.

The present study aimed to assess the beneficial and side effects of STN DBS in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients. <b>Material and Methods:</b> Thirty five patients underwent bilateral STN DBS from 2008 to 2016 in the Rabat University Hospital. Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for 6 to 12 months using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in four conditions (stimulation OFF and ON and medication OFF and ON), the levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), dyskinesia and fluctuation scores and PDQ39 scale for quality of life (QOL). Postoperative side effects were also recorded. <b>Results:</b> The mean age at disease onset was 42.31 \u00b1 7.29 years [28-58] and the mean age at surgery was 54.66 \u00b1 8.51 years [34-70]. The median disease duration was 11.95 \u00b1 4.28 years [5-22]. Sixty-three percentage of patients were male. 11.4% of patients were tremor dominant while 45.71 showed akinetic-rigid form and 42.90 were classified as mixed phenotype. The LEDD before surgery was 1200 mg/day [800-1500]. All patients had motor fluctuations whereas non-motor fluctuations were present in 61.80% of cases. STN DBS decreased the LEDD by 51.72%, as the mean LEDD post-surgery was 450 [188-800]. The UPDRS-III was improved by 52.27%, dyskinesia score by 66.70% and motor fluctuations by 50%, whereas QOL improved by 27.12%. Post-operative side effects were hypophonia (2 cases), infection (3 cases), and pneumocephalus (2 cases). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results showed that STN DBS is an effective treatment in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients leading to a major improvement of the most disabling symptoms (dyskinesia, motor fluctuation) and a better QOL.",

The goal of this study was to translate the original SCOPA-AUT, which was written in English, into Korean and to evaluate its reliability and validity for Korean PD patients. For the translation, the following processes were performed: forward translation, backward translation, expert review, pretest of the pre-final version and development of the final Korean version of SCOPA-AUT (K-SCOPA-AUT). In total, 127 patients with PD from 31 movement disorder clinics of university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. All patients were assessed using the K-SCOPA-AUT and other motor, non-motor, and quality of life scores. Test-retest reliability for the K-SCOPA-AUT was assessed over a time interval of 10-14 days. The internal consistency and reliability of the K-SCOPA-AUT was 0.727 as measured by the mean Cronbach's \u03b1-coefficient. The test-retest correlation reliability was 0.859 by the Guttman split-half coefficient.

However, the effect of PRE may vary with the clinical subtype of PD. To date, no study has assessed the effects of PRE in the different subtypes of PD. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of PRE in PD patients with akinesia and rigidity (AR-subtype). A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Outpatients clinics of the Bierzo Parkinson Association (Ponferrada, Spain) and the Asturias Parkinson Association (Oviedo, Spain). Twenty-eight patients with AR-subtype PD were randomized into an Experimental Group (EG, N.=13) and Control Group (CG, N.=15). Static posturography (Centre of Pressure -CoP- parameters), gait (the Ten-Meter Walk Test [TMWT]), freezing of gait (the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire [FOG-Q]), the motor portion of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and patient-perceived quality of life (the 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire [PDQ39]), were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and re-test. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg &gt;6-20 Scale) were recorded at the end of each PRE training session. The EG displayed significant ameliorations in Length (CoP parameters) from pre- to post-test (P=0.048), in speed of fast rhythm walking (TMWT) from pre- to post-test (P=0.000), and from pre- to re-test (P=0.027), and in the PDQ39 Score from pre- to post-test (P=0.024). No significant differences were detected in Area or Speed (CoP parameters), speed of preferred rhythm walking (TMWT), FOG-Q scores, or the motor portion of the MDS-UPDRS scores. The EG reported a mean RPE of 9.95 (between \"very light\" and \"fairly light\") for the whole training program. These findings provide support for the use of PRE training in the rehabilitation of individuals with AR-subtype PD, as it can improve static posturography, gait, and quality of life. Furthermore, RPE scores showed that individuals with AR-subtype PD consider that PRE training require only light efforts. The PRE training can be a helpful and fruitful rehabilitation tool for AR-subtype PD patients.",

Relatively little work has been done to assess the differential contribution of the specific symptoms of PD to QoL, which was the aim of this study. One hundred thirty patients with PD completed a booklet of questionnaires, which included the PDQ39 as a disease-specific measure of QoL, a symptom checklist, a mobility checklist, as well as patient ratings of disease stage and disability. The results indicated that the contribution of physical, medication-related, and cognitive/psychiatric symptoms to QoL can be significant. Sudden unpredictable on/off states, difficulty in dressing, difficulty in walking, falls, depression, and confusion were PD symptoms, which significantly influenced QoL scores. Among the mobility problems associated with PD, start hesitation, shuffling gait, freezing, festination, propulsion, and difficulty in turning had a significant effect on QoL scores. In addition to depression and anxiety, the major predictors of QoL were shuffling, difficulty turning, falls, difficulty in dressing, fatigue, confusion, autonomic disturbance particularly urinary incontinence, unpredictable on/off fluctuations, and sensory symptoms such as pain. The implications of these results for the medical management of PD are discussed.",

The AUC was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.73-0.84) for PDQ39 and 0.78 (95% CI=0.72-0.85) for PD Symptoms Questionnaire score. At 70% sensitivity, the specificity for PDQ39 score and PD Symptoms Questionnaire score for the prediction of parkinsonism was 73.1% and 80.1%, respectively. These results suggest the questionnaires have reasonably good sensitivity and specificity to predict parkinsonism in Mn exposed workers.

The results of 27 patients for the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ39) and Short Form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF36) were compared before surgery and after 12 months of bilateral STN DBS. Comparing off-dopa conditions before versus 12 months after surgery, both UPDRS part II and part III significantly improved: 32.6% and 52%, respectively. UPDRS part I scores did not change significantly at 12 months. As for PDQ39, the global score significantly improved after surgery (21.1 %) as did four subscores: mobility (25.6 %), activity of daily living (34.5 %), stigma (40.1 %) and bodily discomfort (30 %). Three PDQ39 subscores, however, showed no significant changes: emotional well-being (10.7 %), social support (3.2%) and cognition (8.5 %) and one item even worsened: communication (-7.7 %). In SF36, only physical items significantly improved. Using clinician's based rating scale, bilateral STN DBS showed significant improvement in PD patients at 12 month follow up. However, using patient's self-assessment scales, the clinical benefit of STN DBS was more subtle: physical items of QoL significantly improved, whereas mental items such as emotional well-being, social support, cognition and communication showed no improvement.

In the overall patient group, the mean duration of treatment, the mean daily dose of levodopa, the disability scores and the motor scores of UPDRS were 6.2 years, 186.4 mg, 8.0 and 19.2, respectively. The rates of motor fluctuations, dyskinesias and hallucinations were 8.7%, 6.5% and 14.1%, respectively. The mean summary index of PDQ39 scores was 23.1. Patients with motor fluctuations showed a significantly earlier disease onset. Dose of levodopa, age at onset, and treatment duration were not associated with the occurrence of dyskinesias. Patients with hallucination had higher doses of levodopa and dopamine agonist. Our results demonstrate that chronic administration of a low-dose levodopa preparation can provide satisfactory benefit with a low incidence of motor complications, and can result in good QOL in Japanese patients with PD. The concomitant use of a small amount of dopamine agonist and amantadine from the outset has partly contributed to a reduced dose of levodopa and the lesser occurrence of motor complications.",

Palbociclib and ribociclib are currently food and drug administration-approved for use in combination with aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women with metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. Palbociclib is also food and drug administration-approved for use in combination with fulvestrant in hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer progressing after endocrine therapy. Abemaciclib is the newest cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, specifically as monotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Abemaciclib also shares a similar indication with palbociclib for use in combination with fulvestrant in hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer progressing after endocrine therapy. Trilaciclib use remains largely investigational at this time. However, despite FDA-approval for only metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, all four cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors have shown promise in hematologic malignancies and non-breast solid tumors. Although further research is needed, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors represent intriguing developments in the treatment of various malignancies, including those with such poor prognoses as glioblastoma multiforme, mantle cell lymphoma, and metastatic melanoma.

This study compared the effects of supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, or ALA on the antioxidant defense system and the expression of immune-related genes under oxidative stress induced by dexamethasone (DEX) in broilers. In total, 240 one-day-old female Recessive White Rock chickens were assigned randomly to either a basal diet (control group) or basal diet supplemented with vitamin C (200 mg/kg diet), vitamin E (100 mg/kg), or ALA (500 mg/kg) for 28 d starting from hatching. At 21 d of age, birds fed the ALA-supplemented diet had the highest plasma total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) enzyme activities, and the lowest plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) activity, as well as the lowest mRNA gene expression levels of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF). At 23 d of age, the broilers in the 3 treatment groups were injected in the thigh muscle with DEX for 3 alternating days. In addition, the control group was divided into 2 equal groups, in which one was injected with saline and the other was injected with DEX. At 28 d of age, the DEX-ALA group (P &lt; 0.05) had the highest activity levels for T-AOC, T-SOD, and GSH-PX in the plasma and liver (P &lt; 0.05), and the greatest reduction in the MDA level. Dietary ALA significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of the interleukin 1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and LITAF genes compared with the other groups during oxidative stress by DEX.

To elucidate the influence of l-arginine on the activation of endogenous antioxidant defence, male Wistar rats were orally administered daily with l-arginine at different levels of 25, 50, 100 mg/100 g body weight. After 7 and 14 days feeding, the antioxidative capacities and glutathione (GSH) contents in the plasma and in the liver were uniformly enhanced with the increasing consumption of l-arginine, whereas the oxidative stress was effectively suppressed by l-arginine treatment. After 14 days feeding, the mRNA levels and protein expressions of Keap1 and Cul3 were gradually reduced by increasing l-arginine intake, resulting that the nuclear factor Nrf2 was activated. Upon activation of Nrf2, the expressions of antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-dependent genes and proteins (GCLC, GCLM, GS, GR, GST, GPx, CAT, SOD, NQO1, HO-1) were up-regulated by l-arginine feeding, indicating an upward trend in antioxidant capacity uniformly with the increasing consumption of l-arginine. The present study demonstrates that the supplementation of l-arginine stimulates GSH synthesis and activates Nrf2 pathway, leading to the up-regulation of ARE-driven antioxidant expressions via Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Results suggest the availability of l-arginine is a critical factor to suppress oxidative stress and induce an endogenous antioxidant response.",

MRI demonstrated a 4 cm wide and 2 cm tall nidus and catheter angiography was performed to further define the vascular supply and drainage. The patient underwent transvenous endovascular embolization followed by surgical excision via a bicoronal incision, as shown in this operative video.

We treated an arteriovenous fistula of the scalp with direct puncture and injection of sodium tetradecyl sulfate, a commercially available sclerosing agent. Control angiography immediately following percutaneous injection of sotradecol into the fistula showed decreased flow but not complete closure of the lesion. However, within several days of the embolization, the patient's scalp pain and mass resolved. Four months after embolization, MRA demonstrated no evidence of residual or recurrent fistula. Color doppler flow imaging demonstrated only slightly decreased vascular resistance in the distal superficial temporal artery, possibly indirect evidence of persistent micro-fistulae.

Through parallel studies, we investigated both loss of genetic material and chromosomal rearrangement as possible causes of LMNB1 overexpression, and found that ADLD-1-TO plausibly results from an enhancer adoption mechanism. The deletion eliminates a genome topological domain boundary, allowing normally forbidden interactions between at least three forebrain-directed enhancers and the LMNB1 promoter, in line with the observed mainly cerebral localization of lamin B1 overexpression and myelin degeneration.

Lamin B1 levels were dramatically increased in ADLD nuclei, both in skin fibroblasts and skeletal muscle fibres. Since lamin B1 is known to bind Oct-1, a transcription factor involved in the oxidative stress pathway, we investigated Oct-1 fate in ADLD. Oct-1 recruitment to the nuclear periphery was increased in ADLD cells, while nucleoplasmic localisation of the transcription factor under oxidative stress conditions was reduced. Importantly, lamin B1 degradation occurring in some, but not all ADLD cell lines, slowed down lamin B1 and Oct-1 accumulation. In skeletal muscle, focal disorganisation of sarcomeres was observed, while IIB-myosin heavy chain, an Oct-1 target gene, was under-expressed and rod-containing fibres were formed.

To address this question, we developed a mouse model of ADLD that overexpresses lamin B1. These mice exhibited cognitive impairment and epilepsy, followed by age-dependent motor deficits. Selective overexpression of lamin B1 in oligodendrocytes also resulted in marked motor deficits and myelin defects, suggesting these deficits are cell autonomous. Proteomic and genome-wide transcriptome studies indicated that lamin B1 overexpression is associated with downregulation of proteolipid protein, a highly abundant myelin sheath component that was previously linked to another myelin-related disorder, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Furthermore, we found that lamin B1 overexpression leads to reduced occupancy of Yin Yang 1 transcription factor at the promoter region of proteolipid protein.

We have previously shown that LMNB1 gene duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disease. The mechanisms by which increased LMNB1 levels cause ADLD are unclear. To address this, we used a transgenic mouse model where Lamin B1 overexpression is targeted to oligodendrocytes. These mice showed severe vacuolar degeneration of the spinal cord white matter together with marked astrogliosis, microglial infiltration, and secondary axonal damage. Oligodendrocytes in the transgenic mice revealed alterations in histone modifications favoring a transcriptionally repressed state. Chromatin changes were accompanied by reduced expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis pathways, many of which are known to play important roles in myelin regulation and are preferentially expressed in oligodendrocytes. Decreased lipogenic gene expression resulted in a significant reduction in multiple classes of lipids involved in myelin formation. Many of these gene expression changes and lipid alterations were observed even before the onset of the phenotype, suggesting a causal role. Our findings establish, for the first time, a link between LMNB1 and lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes, and provide a mechanistic framework to explain the age dependence and white matter involvement of the disease phenotype. These results have implications for disease pathogenesis and may also shed light on the regulation of lipid synthesis pathways in myelin maintenance and turnover.

We have studied a mouse model where Lamin B1 level are increased in oligodendrocytes, the cell type that produces myelin in the CNS. We demonstrate that destruction of myelin in the spinal cord is responsible for the degenerative phenotype in our mouse model. We show that this degeneration is mediated by reduced expression of lipid synthesis genes and the subsequent reduction in myelin enriched lipids. These findings provide a mechanistic framework to explain the age dependence and tissue specificity of the ADLD disease phenotype.",

The aim of this study was to investigate brain metabolic and microstructural alterations by using advanced MR techniques. we performed brain MR scans including single-voxel proton-MR Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the lateral ventricles and parietal white matter and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 4 subjects with LMNB1 gene duplication, 6 non-mutated relatives and 7 unrelated healthy controls. Cervical and thoracic spinal cord MR was performed in three symptomatic subjects with LMNB1 mutation. All participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. all subjects with LMNB1 gene duplication presented pathological accumulation of lactate in lateral ventricles CSF and no alterations of brain white matter absolute metabolites concentrations or metabolites/Cr ratios. We found increased white matter intra- and extracellular water transverse relaxation times. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis detected a significantly reduced fractional anisotropy in the genu of the corpus callosum in mutated cases compared to unrelated healthy controls and non-mutated relatives. Moreover, we detected different degrees of the typical white matter signal intensity alterations and brain and spinal atrophy at conventional MRI in symptomatic subjects with LMNB1 mutation. A mild impairment of executive functions was found in subjects with LMNB1 gene mutation. in subjects with LMNB1 gene duplication, we found a pathological increase in CSF lactate, likely due to active demyelination along with glial activation, and microstructural changes in the genu of the corpus callosum possibly underpinning the mild neuropsychological deficits.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27854160": "Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disorder, is the only human disease that has been linked to mutations of the nuclear lamina protein, lamin B1, and is primarily caused by duplications of the LMNB1 gene. Why CNS myelin is specifically targeted and the mechanisms underlying ADLD are unclear. Recent work from our group has demonstrated that over expression of lamin B1 in oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells in the CNS, resulted in age dependent epigenetic modifications, transcriptional down-regulation of lipogenic gene expression and significant reductions of myelin-enriched lipids. Given the high lipid content of meylin, we hypothesize that lipid loss is one of the primary drivers of the demyelination phenotype. These results can, at least partially, explain the age dependence and cell type specificity in ADLD and are discussed in the context of the existing literature, in an attempt to delineate potential pathways underlying the disease phenotype.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143934": "Allele-specific silencing by RNA interference (ASP-siRNA) holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for downregulating a single mutant allele with minimal suppression of the corresponding wild-type allele. This approach has been effectively used to target autosomal dominant mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms linked with aberrantly expanded trinucleotide repeats. Here, we propose ASP-siRNA as a preferable choice to target duplicated disease genes, avoiding potentially harmful excessive downregulation. As a proof-of-concept, we studied autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) due to lamin B1 (LMNB1) duplication, a hereditary, progressive and fatal disorder affecting myelin in the CNS. Using a reporter system, we screened the most efficient ASP-siRNAs preferentially targeting one of the alleles at rs1051644 (average minor allele frequency: 0.45) located in the 3' untranslated region of the gene. We identified four siRNAs with a high efficacy and allele-specificity, which were tested in ADLD patient-derived fibroblasts. Three of the small interfering RNAs were highly selective for the target allele and restored both LMNB1 mRNA and protein levels close to control levels. Furthermore, small interfering RNA treatment abrogates the ADLD-specific phenotypes in fibroblasts and in two disease-relevant cellular models: murine oligodendrocytes overexpressing human LMNB1, and neurons directly reprogrammed from patients' fibroblasts. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ASP-silencing by RNA interference is a suitable and promising therapeutic option for ADLD. Moreover, our results have a broad translational value extending to several pathological conditions linked to gene-gain in copy number variations.",

In a large Italian family, we recently identified a variant form of ADLD characterized clinically by absence of the autonomic dysfunction at onset described in ADLD and, on MRI, by milder cerebellar involvement with sparing of hemispheric white matter. Aim of this study was to investigate the genetic basis of this variant form of ADLD. We carried out a genome-wide linkage analysis using microsatellite markers, and the genes in the candidate region were screened for point mutations. LMNB1 was also screened for deletions/duplications by real-time PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and Southern blot. We mapped the variant ADLD locus to 5q23.2-q23.3, a genomic region containing 11 genes including LMNB1. Neither gene copy-number defects nor point mutations in the LMNB1 gene were found. We also excluded point mutations in the coding exons of the other ten genes in the candidate region. However, expression of lamin B1 evaluated in lymphoblastoid cells was higher in patients than in healthy controls, and was similar to the lamin B1 expression levels found in a patient with LMNB1 duplication. This observation suggests that a mutation in an LMNB1 regulatory sequence underlies the variant ADLD phenotype. Thus, adult forms of ADLD linked to 5q23 appear to be more heterogeneous clinically and genetically than previously thought.",

While at least a dozen disorders are associated with <i>LMNA</i>, the focus of this review is Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), the only disease associated with the lamin B1 gene (<i>LMNB1</i>). ADLD is a fatal, adult onset CNS demyelinating disorder that is caused by either genomic duplications involving <i>LMNB1</i> or deletions upstream of the gene. Both mutation types result in increased <i>LMNB1</i> gene expression. How the increased levels of this widely expressed nuclear structural component results a phenotype as specific as demyelination is a great mystery. This review summarizes what is currently known about the disease and describes recent work using animal and cell culture models that have provided critical insights into ADLD pathological mechanisms. The delineation of these pathways provides a fascinating glimpse into entirely novel roles for the nuclear lamina and will be critical for the identification of therapies for this fatal disease.",

Thus, low RILA values of T-lymphocyte subpopulations have been associated with increased risk for various endpoints at 2 to 3 years of follow-up. The purpose was to test if such associations persist for specific endpoints (subcutaneous fibrosis, telangiectasia) in breast cancer patients with at least 10 years of follow-up.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Two hundred and seventy-two female patients who had received breast-conserving therapy within the German ISE study were included (median follow-up: 11.6 years). Radiotherapy-induced side effects were scored according to the Late Effects in Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic (LENT-SOMA) classification system. RILA in the CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and natural killer (NK) subpopulations from peripheral blood was analyzed by flow cytometry. Multivariate predictive modeling was performed including relevant clinical risk factors. Low CD4<sup>+</sup> RILA was associated with increased risk for both fibrosis (<i>P</i> = 0.011) and telangiectasia (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). For fibrosis, the association was stronger outside the surgical area (Fib<sub>out</sub>; <i>P</i> = 0.004) than within (Fib<sub>in</sub>; <i>P</i> = 0.17). Predictive multivariate modeling including clinical risk factors yielded OR of 3.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.84-6.58) for any fibrosis and 8.60 (2.71-27.3) for telangiectasia. Addition of CD4<sup>+</sup> RILA to the clinical variables improved discrimination (c statistics) from 0.62 to 0.68 for any fibrosis, 0.62 to 0.66 for Fib<sub>in</sub>, 0.61 to 0.69 for Fib<sub>out</sub>, and from 0.65 to 0.76 for telangiectasia. CD8<sup>+</sup> and NK RILA were not significantly associated with radiotherapy-related late reactions. The results provide first evidence that low CD4<sup>+</sup> RILA is associated with increased subcutaneous fibrosis and telangiectasia even after 10 years.

Between 2007 and 2013, all patients who received more than 108% of the prescribed radiation dose, after correction of the treatment plan, were convened, and blood was sampled at 6-months follow-up. Maximal Digestive toxicity (MDT) and maximal urinary toxicity (MUT) were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v3.0 scale. RILA was assessed using flow cytometry. 245 patients were included in our study. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the MDT and MUT reached grade 3-4 in 37 patients and 56 patients, respectively. Patients with prostatectomy exhibited a statistically higher grade of MUT compared with those treated with definitive radiotherapy (<i>p</i>=0.03). The median RILA values were 11.8% and 15.3% for CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, respectively. We found no significant correlation between CD4 or CD8 RILA and either MDT or MUT. RILA does not correlate with the inter-individual variation in MDT or MUT in the largest cohort of patients overexposed to radiation.

We characterize five categories of genes associated with puQTLs, distinguishing single from multi-promoter genes. Among multi-promoter genes, we find puQTL effects either specific to a single promoter or to multiple promoters with variable effect orientations.

It was previously argued that such a topological consolidation toward a condensed, metagenic structure was due to the accumulation of long-range regulations flanking Hox loci, a phenomenon made possible by the successive genome duplications that occurred at the root of the vertebrate lineage, similar to gene neofunctionalization but applied to a coordinated multigenic system. Here, we propose that the emergence of such large vertebrate regulatory landscapes containing a range of global enhancers was greatly facilitated by the presence of topologically associating domains (TADs). These chromatin domains, mostly constitutive, may have been used as genomic niches where novel regulations could evolve due to both the preexistence of a structural backbone poised to integrate novel regulatory inputs, and a highly adaptive transcriptional readout. We propose a scenario for the coevolution of such TADs and the emergence of pleiotropy at ancestral vertebrate Hox loci.",

Here, we show that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers, but not at active promoters with high levels of H3.3K27M proteins, thereby contributing to the global reduction of H3K27me3. Moreover, the levels of H3.3K27M proteins are low at the retained H3K27me3 peaks and consequently having minimal effects on the PRC2 activity at these loci. H3K27me3-mediated silencing at specific tumor suppressor genes, including Wilms Tumor 1, promotes proliferation of DIPG cells. These results support a model in which the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant cells and contributes to tumorigenesis in part by locally enhancing H3K27me3, and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes.",

The poised enhancer signature, involving H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27ac, has been reported to mark inactive enhancers that are poised for future activation. However, future activation is not always observed, and alternative reasons for the widespread occurrence of this enhancer signature have not been investigated. By analyzing enhancers during dorsal-ventral (DV) axis formation in the Drosophila embryo, we find that the poised enhancer signature is specifically generated during patterning in the tissue where the enhancers are not induced, including at enhancers that are known to be repressed by a transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that, rather than serving exclusively as an intermediate step before future activation, the poised enhancer state may be a mark for spatial regulation during tissue patterning. We discuss the possibility that the poised enhancer state is more generally the result of repression by transcriptional repressors.",

Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs.

We focused on gastric cancer (GC), wherein elevated <i>PRL-3</i> mRNA levels significantly correlated with shortened overall survival of GC patients. PRL-3 protein was overexpressed in 85% of fresh-frozen clinical gastric tumor samples examined but not in patient-matched normal gastric tissues. Using human GC cell lines, we demonstrated that PRL3-zumab specifically blocked PRL-3<sup>+</sup>, but not PRL-3<sup>-</sup>, orthotopic gastric tumors. In this setting, PRL3-zumab had better therapeutic efficacy as a monotherapy, rather than simultaneous combination with 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouracil alone.

Mechanistically, we found that intracellular PRL-3 antigens could be externalized to become \"extracellular oncotargets\" that serve as bait for PRL3-zumab binding to potentially bridge and recruit immunocytes into tumor microenvironments for killing effects on cancer cells.

Recent reports have shown that mechanical stretching further promotes osteogenesis in BMSC/VEC co-culture systems, but the underlying mechanism of this process remains unclear. In this study, noncontact co-cultures of rat primary BMSCs and VECs were employed to interrogate paracrine cell-to-cell communications in response to tension. Exposure of VECs to 6% tension for 48 h elicited neither ALP activity nor mRNA expression of OCN and OPN in BMSCs incubated in a shared culture medium. Instead, BMSCs subjected to tension induced robust VEGF release, and its conditioned medium enhanced the proliferation and tubular formation of VECs with a concurrent increase in BMP-2 and IGF-1 production. Conditioned medium from activated VECs in turn promoted expression of osteogenic genes in BMSCs, followed by an increase in matrix mineralization. The addition of VEGF-R inhibitor Tivozanib to these systems abrogated the tension-induced paracrine effects on VECs and subsequently impaired BMSC osteogenesis. These results clearly demonstrate that the response of BMSCs to tension potentiates paracrine osteogenic signaling from VECs; this positive feedback loop is initiated by VEGF release.",

Despite initial therapeutic response, the majority of advanced-stage patients relapse and succumb to chemoresistant disease. Overcoming drug resistance is the key to successful treatment of EOC. Members of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family are overexpressed in EOC and play key roles in its malignant progression though their contribution in development of the chemoresistant disease remains elusive. Here we show that expression of the VEGF family is higher in therapy-resistant EOC cells compared to sensitive ones. Overexpression of VEGFR2 correlated with resistance to cisplatin and combination with VEGFR2-inhibitor apatinib synergistically increased cisplatin sensitivity. Tivozanib, a pan-inhibitor of VEGF receptors, reduced proliferation of the chemoresistant EOC cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Tivozanib decreased invasive potential of these cells, concomitant with reduction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and diminishing the enzymatic activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2).

Tivozanib is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-1, -2 and -3 receptors. ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines were treated with respective substrate antineoplastic agents in the presence or absence of tivozanib. The results indicate that tivozanib can significantly reverse ABCB1-mediated resistance to paclitaxel, vinblastine and colchicine, as well as ABCG2-mediated resistance to mitoxantrone, SN-38 and doxorubicin. Drug efflux assays showed that tivozanib increased the intracellular accumulation of substrates by inhibiting the ABCB1 and ABCG2 efflux activity. Furthermore, at a higher concentration, tivozanib inhibited the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 and inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 or ABCG2. We conclude that tivozanib at noncytotoxic concentrations has the previously unknown activity of reversing multidrug resistance mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28287096": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most fatal human malignancies due to its high angiogenic and infiltrative capacities. Even with optimal therapy including surgery, radiotherapy and temozolomide, it is essentially incurable. GBM is among the most neovascularised neoplasms and its malignant progression associates with striking neovascularisation, evidenced by vasoproliferation and endothelial cell hyperplasia. Targeting the pro-angiogenic pathways is therefore a promising anti-glioma strategy. Here we show that tivozanib, a pan-inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, inhibited proliferation of GBM cells through a G2/M cell cycle arrest via inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) signalling pathway and down-modulation of Aurora kinases A and B, cyclin B1 and CDC25C. Moreover, tivozanib decreased adhesive potential of these cells through reduction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Tivozanib diminished GBM cell invasion through impairing the proteolytic cascade of cathepsin B/urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Combination of tivozanib with EGFR small molecule inhibitor gefitinib synergistically increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Altogether, these findings suggest that VEGFR blockade by tivozanib has potential anti-glioma effects in vitro. Further in vivo studies are warranted to explore the anti-tumour activity of tivozanib in combinatorial approaches in GBM.",

Two phase I, open-label, 2-period, single-sequence studies evaluated the effect of steady-state ketoconazole (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01363778\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01363778</a>) or rifampin (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01363804\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01363804</a>) on the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and tolerability of a single oral 1.5-mg dose of tivozanib. Tivozanib was well tolerated in both studies. Steady-state ketoconazole did not cause a clinically significant change in the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of tivozanib; therefore, dosing of tivozanib with a CYP3A4 pathway inhibitor should not cause a clinically significant change in serum tivozanib levels. However, coadministration of tivozanib with rifampin caused a significant decrease in the area under the curve from 0 to infinity and half-life and an increase in clearance of tivozanib, which suggest increased clearance via the enhanced CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of tivozanib.",

Studies have shown that early planning of discharge is essential in reducing length of stay and achieving financial benefit; tools that can help predict discharge disposition would therefore be of use. The Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) is a preoperative survey constructed to predict discharge disposition after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The RAPT was developed and tested on a population of Australian patients undergoing joint replacement, but its validity in other populations is unknown. A low RAPT score is reported to indicate a high risk of needing any form of inpatient rehabilitation after TJA, including short-term nursing facilities. This study attempts (1) to assess predictive accuracy of the RAPT on US patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA); and (2) to determine predictive accuracy of each individual score (1-12). Between June 2006 and December 2011, RAPT scores of 3213 patients (1449 THAs; 1764 TKAs) were prospectively captured during the preoperative clinical visit. Scores were stored along with other clinical data, including discharge disposition, in a dedicated database on a secure server. The database was queried by the nursing case manager to retrieve the RAPT scores of all patients captured during this time period. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the scores and determine predictive accuracy. Overall predictive accuracy was 78%. RAPT scores&lt;6 and &gt;10 (of 12) predicted with &gt;90% accuracy discharge to inpatient rehabilitation and home, respectively.

Predictive accuracy for these patients could potentially be improved through the identification and addition of other factors correlated to discharge disposition. The RAPT allows for identification of patients who are likely to be discharged home or to rehabilitation, which may facilitate preoperative planning of postoperative care.

Retrospectively collected data were analyzed from a single institution in patients undergoing elective primary total joint arthroplasty from January 2016 to April 2017. Predictive accuracy (PA) was calculated for each RAPT score (1-12), RAPT score risk ranges (low, intermediate, and high), as well as overall. Other factors evaluated included patient-reported discharge expectation, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores as related to discharge disposition and the PA of RAPT.

Here we show that PRL3-zumab specifically inhibits PRL3<sup>+</sup> cancer cells in vivo, but not in vitro. PRL3 antigens are detected on the cell surface and outer exosomal membranes, implying an 'inside-out' externalization of PRL3. PRL3-zumab binds to surface PRL3 in a manner consistent with that in classical antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis tumor elimination pathways, as PRL3-zumab requires an intact Fc region and host Fc\u03b3II/III receptor engagement to recruit B cells, NK cells and macrophages to PRL3<sup>+</sup> tumor microenvironments. PRL3 is overexpressed in 80.6% of 151 fresh-frozen tumor samples across 11 common cancers examined, but not in patient-matched normal tissues, thereby implicating PRL3 as a tumor-associated antigen.

However, implementation of this assay into clinical routine has been cumbersome, as a validated test was not available until recently. Circulating tumor cells are rare events which can be detected specifically only by using a combination of surface and intracellular markers, and only recently a number of technical advances have made their reliable detection possible. Most of these new techniques rely on a combination of an enrichment and a detection step. This review addresses the assays that have been described so far in the literature, including the enrichment and detection steps and the markers used in these assays. We have focused on breast cancer as most clinical studies on CTC detection so far have been done in these patients.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20155985": "The selective detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is of significant clinical importance for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of cancer metastasis. However, largely because of the extremely low number of CTCs (as low as 1 in 10(9) hematologic cells) in the blood of patients, effective detection and separation of the rare cells remain a tremendous challenge. Cell rolling is known to play a key role in physiological processes such as the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and selectin-mediated CTC metastasis. Furthermore, because CTCs typically express the epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on the surface whereas normal hematologic cells do not, substrates with immobilized antibody against EpCAM may specifically interact with CTCs. In this article, we created biomimetic surfaces functionalized with P- and E-selectin and anti-EpCAM that induce different responses in HL-60 (used as a model of leukocytes in this study) and MCF-7 (a model of CTCs) cells. HL-60 and MCF-7 cells showed different degrees of interaction with P-/E-selectin and anti-EpCAM at a shear stress of 0.32 dyn/cm(2). HL-60 cells exhibited rolling on P-selectin-immobilized substrates at a velocity of 2.26 +/- 0.28 microm/s whereas MCF-7 cells had no interaction with the surface. Both cell lines, however, had interactions with E-selectin, and the rolling velocity of MCF-7 cells (4.24 +/- 0.31 microm/s) was faster than that of HL-60 cells (2.12 +/- 0.15 microm/s). However, only MCF-7 cells interacted with anti-EpCAM-coated surfaces, forming stationary binding under flow. More importantly, the combination of the rolling (E-selectin) and stationary binding (anti-EpCAM) resulted in substantially enhanced separation capacity and capture efficiency (more than 3-fold enhancement), as compared to a surface functionalized solely with anti-EpCAM that has been commonly used for CTC capture. Our results indicate that cell-specific detection and separation may be achieved through mimicking the biological processes of combined dynamic cell rolling and stationary binding, which will likely lead to a CTC detection device with significantly enhanced specificity and sensitivity without a complex fabrication process.",

However, selective capture and quantification of CTCs from whole blood was still full of challenge due to the extremely scare number of CTCs. Moreover, how to keep a high cell viability after capture remained to be solved. Here, we described a ratiometric fluorescent probe for the efficient capture and accurate determination of CTCs by conjugating graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CNQDs) with gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and further linking with anti-EpCAM antibody to acquire the CTC-specific immune probe. In this probe, AuNCs protected by albumin V bovine played the role as the fluorophore reference and anti-EpCAM-attached g-CNQDs acted as both the response signal and specific recognition element for sensing CTCs. In the presence of CTCs, the quenched fluorescence of the immune probe at 500 nm was recovered due to the detachment of anti-EpCAM from the probe, whereas the intensity at 650 nm was essentially unchanged. This strategy realized the highly sensitive detection of CTCs in whole blood down to one CTC. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the designed probe allowed capturing living CTCs with minimal cell damage. The subsequent reculture of captured cells for proliferation revealed that after a 7 day proliferation, almost 28 MCF-7 cells were obtained from one target cell. The immune probe was successfully applied into capture and detection of CTCs from clinical cancer patients.

The IMNs were achieved by functionalizing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanospheres (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) with polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), and then coating with epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule antibody (anti-EpCAM). The IMNs exhibited outstanding cell capture efficiency (above 95%) and specificity when employed to separate multiple EpCAM-positive tumor cells, due to the abundant carboxyl groups in the structure of PIL, which enhanced the coupling efficiency of MNs with anti-EpCAM by chemical bonding between carboxyls and amines, thereby enabling more target cells adhered onto IMNs. Under the optimized capture conditions, IMNs were shown an excellent cell capture performance in the range of 5-400 cells/mL in three different cases (e.g., PBS, MCF-7 and THP-1 mixed cell suspension, lysed blood). More significantly, our results indicated that with modification of PIL, in addition to the capture efficiency, the cell viability rate of CTCs was also greatly improved (98%) owing to the nontoxic and biocompatible properties of PIL, which realized the proliferation of the rare number CTCs for further molecular characterization. Finally, the IMNs were successfully applied to the isolation and detection of CTCs in cancer patient peripheral blood samples and as low as one CTC in the whole blood was captured and identified by the ICC method.",

In this study, a microfluidic device was proposed to generate uniform water-in-oil cell-encapsulating micro-droplets, followed by the fluorescence-based optical detection of lactic acid produced within the micro-droplets. To test its feasibility to quantify cancer cells, experiments were carried out. Results showed that the detection signals were proportional to the number of cancer cells within the micro-droplets, whereas such signals were insensitive to the existence and number of leukocytes within. To further demonstrate its feasibility for cancer cell detection, the cancer cells with known cell number in a cell suspension was detected based on the method. Results revealed that there was no significant difference between the detected number and the real number of cancer cells.

Forty-two cortical tissue specimens were excised from three bovine femurs and irradiated to 35 and 70 kGy gamma rays in the presence of 5, 50, and 100 mM concentrations of NAC. The localized variations in microhardness were evaluated via indentation in the radial and longitudinal directions to examine different regions of the microstructures of the specimens, including the osteonal and interstitial tissues.

These elements are separated by 40 kb but cluster in the nuclear space depending on CTCF but independent of estrogen and transcription. In contrast, in estrogen non-responsive breast cancer cells, the spatial proximity of these two elements is lost and the entire locus instead displays a polycomb repressive complex 2-controlled heterochromatin characteristic. We showed that CTCF acts upstream of the \"pioneer\" factor FOXA1 in determining the genomic response to estrogen.

Almost all ER-chromatin interactions and gene expression changes depended on the presence of FOXA1 and FOXA1 influenced genome-wide chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, we found that CTCF was an upstream negative regulator of FOXA1-chromatin interactions. In estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells, the dependency on FOXA1 for tamoxifen-ER activity was absolute; in tamoxifen-resistant cells, ER binding was independent of ligand but depended on FOXA1.

We used a genome-wide analysis of promoter occupancy by the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in MCF-7 cells to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of 17beta-estradiol (E2) in controlling the growth of breast cancer cells. We identified 153 promoters bound by ERalpha in the presence of E2. Motif-finding algorithms demonstrated that the estrogen response element (ERE) is the most common motif present in these promoters whereas conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed E2-modulated recruitment of coactivator AIB1 and RNA polymerase II at these loci. The promoters were linked to known ERalpha targets but also to many genes not directly associated with the estrogenic response, including the transcriptional factor FOXA1, whose expression correlates with the presence of ERalpha in breast tumors. We found that ablation of FOXA1 expression in MCF-7 cells suppressed ERalpha binding to the prototypic TFF1 promoter (which contains a FOXA1 binding site), hindered the induction of TFF1 expression by E2, and prevented hormone-induced reentry into the cell cycle. Taken together, these results define a paradigm for estrogen action in breast cancer cells and suggest that regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors can be compartmentalized into unique transcriptional domains by means of licensing of their activity to cofactors such as FOXA1.",

Cells from XP group E (XP-E) patients have a defect in the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex (UV-DDB), involved in the damage recognition step of NER. UV-DDB comprises two subunits, products of the DDB1 and DDB2 genes, respectively. Mutations in the DDB2 gene account for the underlying defect in XP-E. The UV-DDB complex is a component of the newly identified cullin 4A-based ubiquitin E3 ligase, DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2). The E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize specific substrates and mediate their ubiquitination to regulate protein activity or target proteins for degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In this study, we have addressed the role of the UV-DDB-based E3 in NER and sought a physiological substrate. We demonstrate that monoubiquitinated histone H2A in native chromatin coimmunoprecipitates with the endogenous DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) complex in response to UV irradiation. Further, mutations in DDB2 alter the formation and binding activity of the DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) ligase, accompanied by impaired monoubiquitination of H2A after UV treatment of XP-E cells, compared with repair-proficient cells. This finding indicates that DDB2, as the substrate receptor of the DDB1-CUL4A-based ligase, specifically targets histone H2A for monoubiquitination in a photolesion-binding-dependent manner. Given that the loss of monoubiquitinated histone H2A at the sites of UV-damaged DNA is associated with decreased global genome repair in XP-E cells, this study suggests that histone modification, mediated by the XPE factor, facilitates the initiation of NER.",

UV-mediated degradation of p48 occurs independently of the expression of p53 and the cell's proficiency for NER, but recovery of p48 levels at later times (12 h and thereafter) is dependent upon the capacity of the cell to repair non-transcribed DNA.

From May 2016 to October 2016, the personal radiation doses of two interventionists and four technicians were prospectively recorded during 206 vascular interventions. The position of personnel, intervention type and fluoroscopy time were recorded. Parameters evaluated were total body dose measured by film dosimeter, hand dose measured by ring thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) and ocular lens dose measured by TLD placed in front of the safety glasses. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the dose at 2 and 5 years. The ocular lens dose, hand and total body dose of the two interventionists were 11/5, 56/47 and 0.6 mSv each, respectively. The estimated 5-year ocular dose was 113.08 mSv (95% CI 38.2-187.97)/40.95 (95% CI 16.9-64.7). Similarly, hand dose was 608.4 mSv (95% CI 442.78-774.38)/514.47 (95% CI 329.83-699.10) and body dose 6.07 mSv (95% CI 4.70-8.22)/5.12 (95% CI 3.65-6.59), respectively. Amongst four technicians, only the first assistant showed recordings of 0.3 mSv body dose, 2 mSv ocular lens dose and 5 mSv hand dose. The yearly ocular lens dose, particularly for interventionists dealing with complex interventions, could cross the permitted yearly limit set by the new Euratom directive. Therefore, X-ray safety glasses would become mandatory for complex radiological vascular interventions. Level III, non-randomized controlled cohort/follow-up study.",

However, how miRISC identifies the target mRNA in vivo is not well understood. Here, we show that the nucleoporin Nup358 plays an important role in this process. Nup358 localizes to the nuclear pore complex and to the cytoplasmic annulate lamellae (AL), and these structures dynamically associate with two mRNP granules: processing bodies (P bodies) and stress granules (SGs). Nup358 depletion disrupts P bodies and concomitantly impairs the miRNA pathway. Furthermore, Nup358 interacts with AGO and GW182 proteins and promotes the association of target mRNA with miRISC A well-characterized SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in Nup358 is sufficient for Nup358 to directly bind to AGO proteins. Moreover, AGO and PIWI proteins interact with SIMs derived from other SUMO-binding proteins. Our study indicates that Nup358-AGO interaction is important for miRNA-mediated gene silencing and identifies SIM as a new interacting motif for the AGO family of proteins. The findings also support a model wherein the coupling of miRISC with the target mRNA could occur at AL, specialized domains within the ER, and at the nuclear envelope.",

The proteins that tether Tpr to this location are unknown. Moreover, the question whether Tpr itself might act as a scaffold onto which other NPC components need to be assembled has not been answered to date. To assess Tpr's role as an architectural element of the NPC, we have studied the sequential disassembly and reassembly of NPCs in mitotic cells, paralleled by studies of cells depleted of Tpr as a result of posttranscriptional tpr gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). NPC assembly and recruitment of several nucleoporins, including Nup50, Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, and Nup153, in anaphase/early telophase is shown to precede NPC association of Tpr in late telophase. In accordance, cellular depletion of Tpr by RNAi does not forestall binding of these nucleoporins to the NPC. In a search for proteins that moor Tpr to the NPC, we have combined the RNAi approach with affinity-chromatography and yeast two-hybrid interaction studies, leading to the identification of nucleoporin Nup153 as the binding partner for Tpr. The specificity of this interaction is demonstrated by its sensitivity to Tpr amino acid substitution mutations that abolish Tpr's ability to adhere to the NPC and affect the direct binding of Tpr to Nup153. Accordingly, cellular depletion of Nup153 by RNAi is shown to result in mislocalization of Tpr to the nuclear interior. Nup153 deficiency also causes mislocalization of Nup50 but has no direct effect on NPC localization of the other nucleoporins studied in this investigation. In summary, these results render Tpr a protein only peripherally attached to the NPC that does not act as an essential scaffold for other nucleoporins.",

We report that yeast Esc1, a non-NPC nuclear envelope protein, is required both for proper assembly of the nuclear basket, a structure extending into the nucleus from the NPC, and for normal NPC localization of the Ulp1 SUMO protease. In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Loss of Esc1 (or Nup60) alters SUMO conjugate accumulation and enhances ulp1 mutant defects. Similar to previous findings with Mlp1, both Esc1 and Ulp1 help retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. Therefore, these proteins are essential for proper nuclear basket function, which includes mRNA surveillance and regulation of SUMO protein dynamics. The results raise the possibility that NPC-localized protein desumoylation may be a key regulatory event preventing inappropriate pre-mRNA export.",

We also found that Tpr depletion impairs the NES [nuclear export sequence]-dependent nuclear export of proteins and causes partial co-depletion of Nup153. In addition Tpr depletion impacts on level and function of the SUMO-protease SENP2 thus affecting SUMOylation regulation at the nuclear pore and overall SUMOylation in the cell. Our data for the first time provide evidence that a nuclear pore component plays a role in controlling cellular senescence. Our findings also point to new roles for Tpr in the regulation of SUMO-1 conjugation at the nuclear pore and directly confirm Tpr involvement in the nuclear export of NES-proteins.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077526": "Current genome-wide ChIP-seq experiments on different epigenetic marks aim at unraveling the interplay between their regulation mechanisms. Published evaluation tools, however, allow testing for predefined hypotheses only. Here, we present a novel method for annotation-independent exploration of epigenetic data and their inter-correlation with other genome-wide features. Our method is based on a combinatorial genome segmentation solely using information on combinations of epigenetic marks. It does not require prior knowledge about the data (e.g. gene positions), but allows integrating the data in a straightforward manner. Thereby, it combines compression, clustering and visualization of the data in a single tool. Our method provides intuitive maps of epigenetic patterns across multiple levels of organization, e.g. of the co-occurrence of different epigenetic marks in different cell types. Thus, it facilitates the formulation of new hypotheses on the principles of epigenetic regulation. We apply our method to histone modification data on trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, 9 and 27 in multi-potent and lineage-primed mouse cells, analyzing their combinatorial modification pattern as well as differentiation-related changes of single modifications. We demonstrate that our method is capable of reproducing recent findings of gene centered approaches, e.g. correlations between CpG-density and the analyzed histone modifications. Moreover, combining the clustered epigenetic data with information on the expression status of associated genes we classify differences in epigenetic status of e.g. house-keeping genes versus differentiation-related genes. Visualizing the distribution of modification states on the chromosomes, we discover strong patterns for chromosome X. For example, exclusively H3K9me3 marked segments are enriched, while poised and active states are rare. Hence, our method also provides new insights into chromosome-specific epigenetic patterns, opening up new questions how \"epigenetic computation\" is distributed over the genome in space and time.",

In TAO, the orbit can become inflamed and undergo substantial remodeling that is disfiguring and can lead to loss of vision. There are currently no approved medical therapies for TAO, the consequence of its uncertain pathogenic nature. It usually presents as a component of the syndrome known as Graves' disease where loss of immune tolerance to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) results in the generation of activating antibodies against that protein and hyperthyroidism. The role for TSHR and these antibodies in the development of TAO is considerably less well established. We have reported over the past 2 decades evidence that the insulin-like growth factorI receptor (IGF1R) may also participate in the pathogenesis of TAO. Activating antibodies against IGF1R have been detected in patients with GD. The actions of these antibodies initiate signaling in orbital fibroblasts from patients with the disease. Further, we have identified a functional and physical interaction between TSHR and IGF1R. Importantly, it appears that signaling initiated from either receptor can be attenuated by inhibiting the activity of IGF1R. These findings underpin the rationale for therapeutically targeting IGF1R in active TAO. A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug. It is possible that other autoimmune diseases might also benefit from this treatment strategy.",

Discussions of its pathogenesis are generally focused on the thyrotropin receptor, the proposed role for which is supported by substantial evidence. Considerations of any involvement of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in the disease are frequently contentious. In this brief, topically focused review, I have attempted to provide a balanced perspective based entirely on experimental results that either favor or refute involvement of IGF-IR in TAO. Discussion in this matter seems particularly timely since the currently available treatments of this disfiguring and potentially sight-threatening disease remain inadequate. Importantly, no medical therapy has thus far received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Results from a very recently published clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab, an inhibitory human anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody, in active, moderate to severe TAO are extremely encouraging. That double-masked, placebo-controlled study involved 88 patients and revealed unprecedented clinical responses in the improvement of proptosis and clinical activity as well as a favorable safety profile.

Real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, reporter gene assays, cell transfections, mRNA stability assays, ELISA, and flow cytometry were performed. We found that bTSH induces TNF-\u03b1 dramatically in fibrocytes but is undetectable in GD-OF. The induction in fibrocytes is a consequence of increased TNF-\u03b1 gene promoter activity and is independent of ongoing protein synthesis. It could be attenuated by dexamethasone and the IGF-1 receptor inhibiting antibody, teprotumumab. When separated into pure CD34+ OF and CD34- OF subsets, TNF-\u03b1 mRNA became highly inducible by bTSH in CD34+ OF but remained undetectable in CD34- OF. Conditioned medium from CD34- OF inhibited induction of TNF-\u03b1 in fibrocytes. Our data indicate that CD34- OF appear to release a soluble(s) factor that downregulates expression and induction by bTSH of TNF-\u03b1 in fibrocytes and their derivative CD34+ OF.

It is disfiguring and potentially blinding, culminating in orbital tissue remodeling and disruption of function of structures adjacent to the eye. There are currently no medical therapies proven capable of altering the clinical outcome of TAO in randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trials. The orbital fibroblast represents the central target for immune reactivity. Recent identification of fibroblasts that putatively originate in the bone marrow as monocyte progenitors provides a plausible explanation for why antigens, the expressions of which were once considered restricted to the thyroid, are detected in the TAO orbit. These cells, known as fibrocytes, express relatively high levels of functional TSH receptor (TSHR) through which they can be activated by TSH and the GD-specific pathogenic antibodies that underpin thyroid overactivity. Fibrocytes also express insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) with which TSHR forms a physical and functional signaling complex. Notably, inhibition of IGF-IR activity results in the attenuation of signaling initiated at either receptor. Some studies suggest that IGF-IR-activating antibodies are generated in GD, whereas others refute this concept. These observations served as the rationale for implementing a recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a monoclonal inhibitory antibody targeting IGF-IR in TAO. Results of that trial in active, moderate to severe disease revealed dramatic and rapid reductions in disease activity and severity.

Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment, but new evidence about immune mechanisms has provided a basis to explore other drug classes. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses are more effective and better tolerated than oral prednisone in the treatment of active, moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Rituximab has also been suggested as a possible replacement for intravenous corticosteroids. Two randomised controlled trials of rituximab reached seemingly contradictory conclusions-rituximab was not better with respect to the primary outcome (clinical activity score) than placebo in one trial (which, however, was confounded by rather long Graves' ophthalmopathy duration), but was slightly better than intravenous methylprednisolone pulses in the other (disease flare-ups occurred only in the latter group). On the basis of evidence published so far, rituximab cannot replace intravenous methylprednisolone pulses, but could have a role in corticosteroid-resistant cases.

OS for dalotuzumab, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and PFS for prostate cancer even indicated harmful effects. So far, anti-IGF-1R mono-antibodies did not make significant differences in solid tumor prognosis. On the contrary, pessimistic effects were shown in the dalotuzumab, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer subgroups.

Secondary end points, measured as continuous variables, included proptosis, the Clinical Activity Score, and results on the Graves' ophthalmopathy-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Adverse events were assessed.

To characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying TSH-induced TNF\u03b1 production by FCs, and the role of IGF-1R blockade by TMB. FCs from healthy and GD patients were treated with combinations of TSH, M22, MG132 and AKTi (inhibitors of NF-\u03baB and Akt, respectively), and TMB. TNF\u03b1 protein production was measured by Luminex and flow cytometry. Messenger RNA expression was quantified by real time PCR.

These cells were collected from patients with Graves disease and healthy individuals. PTX-3 mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR, protein was determined by ELISA and Western blot, and PTX-3 gene promoter activity was assessed with reporter assays. PTX-3 expression was induced by TSH in both cell types, regardless of the health status of the donor and was a consequence of increased steady-state PTX-3 mRNA levels.

Here, we present the comparative study on the structural and conformational changes in globular DNA binding domain of XPA<sub>98-210</sub> in DNA bound and DNA free state. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulation was carried out for both XPA<sub>98-210</sub> systems using AMBER force fields. We observed that XPA<sub>98-210</sub> in presence of damaged DNA exhibited more structural changes compared to XPA<sub>98-210</sub> in its free form. When XPA is in contact with DNA, we found marked stability of the complex due to the formation of characteristic longer antiparallel \u03b2-sheets consisting mainly lysine residues.",

Many classes of DNA lesions induced by chemical agents are eliminated via DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER), for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Individuals with NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), in which bulky DNA lesions are not efficiently removed, are cancer-prone and suffer neurodegeneration. For research into cancer and neurological diseases, therefore, it might be important to identify DNA damage from agents that induce NER-repairable bulky DNA lesions. However, simple and quick assays to detect such damaging agents have not been developed using human cells. Here, we report a simple, non-isotopic assay for determining DNA damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions by visualizing gene expression from treated fluorescent protein vectors in a mammalian cell system. This assay is based on a comparison of fluorescent protein expression in NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells. When we tested UV-irradiated fluorescent protein vectors, the fluorescent protein was observed in NER-proficient cells, but not in NER-deficient cells. Similar results were obtained for vectors treated with the anticancer drug, cisplatin. In contrast, when treated with the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, believed to cause BER-repairable damage, no difference in gene expression between NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells was observed. These results suggest that our assay can specifically detect DNA-damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions, and could be used to analyze chemicals with the potential to cause cancer and neurological diseases. With further validation, the assay might be also applicable to XP diagnosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26074087": "The ERCC1 and ERCC4 genes encode the two subunits of the ERCC1-XPF nuclease. This enzyme plays an important role in repair of DNA damage and in maintaining genomic stability. ERCC1-XPF nuclease nicks DNA specifically at junctions between double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, when the single-strand is oriented 5' to 3' away from a junction. ERCC1-XPF is a core component of nucleotide excision repair and also plays a role in interstrand crosslink repair, some pathways of double-strand break repair by homologous recombination and end-joining, as a backup enzyme in base excision repair, and in telomere length regulation. In many of these activities, ERCC1-XPF complex cleaves the 3' tails of DNA intermediates in preparation for further processing. ERCC1-XPF interacts with other proteins including XPA, RPA, SLX4 and TRF2 to perform its functions. Disruption of these interactions or direct targeting of ERCC1-XPF to decrease its DNA repair function might be a useful strategy to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to some DNA damaging agents. Complete deletion of either ERCC1 or ERCC4 is not compatible with viability in mice or humans. However, mutations in the ERCC1 or ERCC4 genes cause a remarkable array of rare inherited human disorders. These include specific forms of xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, Fanconi anemia, XFE progeria and cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome.",

The condition is characterised by a clinical triad of symptoms; homogentisic aciduria from birth, ochronosis (darkening) of collagenous tissues (from \u223c30years of age) and ochronotic osteoarthropathy in weight bearing joints due to long term ochronosis in them (from \u223c40years of age). Tyrosinase, a polyphenol oxidase has been shown in many species to contribute to the darkening of tissues in many organisms; including humans in the production of melanin.

We hypothesise that interleukins play a role in initiation and progression of ochronotic osteoarthropathy. C20/A4 cells were cultured and maintained in 9-cm petri dishes containing either HGA at 0.33 mM, a single interleukin (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 or IL-10) at 1 ng/ml or a combination of HGA and a single interleukin. Statistical analysis of pigment deposits and cell viability was performed using analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls post-test. All cultures containing HGA showed a significant increase in pigment deposition compared to control and IL cultures alone. The cultures containing HGA and IL-6 showed a significant increase in pigment deposits compared to HGA alone. The cell viability counts across all cultures on day 10 demonstrated a significant decrease in cultures containing HGA compared to those which did not. There was no significant difference between cultures containing just HGA or those combined with an interleukin. This work demonstrates a role for cytokines present in the joint(s) in the pigmentation process, particularly IL-6, and that the presence of HGA in joint tissues appears more detrimental to chondrocytes than the presence of any of the interleukins found in response to joint injury, trauma and osteoarthritis (OA).

Ochronotic and non-ochronotic cartilage from human hips and ears were analysed using Raman spectroscopy. Non-ochronotic cartilage spectra were similar and reproducible and typical of normal articular cartilage. Conversely, the ochronotic cartilage samples were highly fluorescent and displayed limited or no discernible Raman peaks in the spectra, in stark contrast to their non-ochronotic pairs. Interestingly, a novel peak was observed associated with the polymer of HGA in the ochronotic cartilage that was confirmed by analysis of pigment derived from synthetic HGA.

In this review, we discuss study findings and their clinical relevance, present the most promising targets, and analyze possible explanations to negative results, such as inappropriate patient selection and treatment response criteria or the erratic use of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy.",

Patients (n = 305) were randomized to receive intravenous anifrolumab (300 mg or 1,000 mg) or placebo, in addition to standard therapy, every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Randomization was stratified by SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 score (&lt;10 or \u226510), oral corticosteroid dosage (&lt;10 or \u226510 mg/day), and type I IFN gene signature test status (high or low) based on a 4-gene expression assay. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving an SLE Responder Index (SRI[4]) response at week 24 with sustained reduction of oral corticosteroids (&lt;10 mg/day and less than or equal to the dose at week 1 from week 12 through 24). Other end points (including SRI[4], British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG]-based Composite Lupus Assessment [BICLA], modified SRI[6], and major clinical response) were assessed at week 52. The primary end point was analyzed in the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population and type I IFN-high subpopulation. The study result was considered positive if the primary end point was met in either of the 2 study populations. The Type I error rate was controlled at 0.10 (2-sided), within each of the 2 study populations for the primary end point analysis. The primary end point was met by more patients treated with anifrolumab (34.3% of 99 for 300 mg and 28.8% of 104 for 1,000 mg) than placebo (17.6% of 102) (P = 0.014 for 300 mg and P = 0.063 for 1,000 mg, versus placebo), with greater effect size in patients with a high IFN signature at baseline (13.2% in placebo-treated patients versus 36.0% [P = 0.004] and 28.2% [P = 0.029]) in patients treated with anifrolumab 300 mg and 1,000 mg, respectively. At week 52, patients treated with anifrolumab achieved greater responses in SRI(4) (40.2% versus 62.6% [P &lt; 0.001] and 53.8% [P = 0.043] with placebo, anifrolumab 300 mg, and anifrolumab 1,000 mg, respectively), BICLA (25.7% versus 53.5% [P &lt; 0.001] and 41.2% [P = 0.018], respectively), modified SRI(6) (28.4% versus 49.5% [P = 0.002] and 44.7% [P = 0.015], respectively), major clinical response (BILAG 2004 C or better in all organ domains from week 24 through week 52) (6.9% versus 19.2% [P = 0.012] and 17.3% [P = 0.025], respectively), and several other global and organ-specific end points. Herpes zoster was more frequent in the anifrolumab-treated patients (2.0% with placebo treatment versus 5.1% and 9.5% with anifrolumab 300 mg and 1,000 mg, respectively), as were cases reported as influenza (2.0% versus 6.1% and 7.6%, respectively), in the anifrolumab treatment groups. Incidence of serious adverse events was similar between groups (18.8% versus 16.2% and 17.1%, respectively). Anifrolumab substantially reduced disease activity compared with placebo across multiple clinical end points in the patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.",

Rash was measured with the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Index and modified Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (mCLASI). Arthritis was evaluated using SLEDAI-2K, BILAG and swollen and tender joint counts. Outcomes were measured at week 52. More anifrolumab-treated patients demonstrated resolution of rash by SLEDAI-2K versus placebo: 39/88 (44.3%) versus 13/88 (14.8%), OR (90% CI) 4.56 (2.48 to 8.39), p&lt;0.001; improvement of BILAG: 48/82 (58.5%) versus 24/85 (28.2%), OR (90% CI) 3.59 (2.08 to 6.19), p&lt;0.001; and \u226550% improvement by mCLASI: 57/92 (62.0%) versus 30/89 (33.7%), OR (90% CI) 3.31 (1.97 to 5.55), p&lt;0.001.

Comparable results were demonstrated in IFNGS test-high patients (n=151). In IFNGS test-low patients (n=50), substantial numerical differences in partial rash and arthritis responses were observed in anifrolumab-treated patients versus placebo, with statistical significance only for rash by BILAG in this small population. Anifrolumab treatment was associated with improvements versus placebo in specific SLE features of arthritis and rash using measures of different stringency. Although driven by robust data in the prevalent IFNGS test-high population, further evaluation in IFNGS test-low patients is warranted.",

More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series.",

When left unrepaired or when damaged cells are not eliminated by apoptosis, DNA lesions express their mutagneic properties, leading to the activation of proto-oncogene or the inactivation of tumor suppression genes. The chemical nature and the amount of DNA damage strongly depend on the wavelength of the incident photons. The most energetic part of the solar spectrum at the Earth's surface (UVB, 280-320 nm) leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (64PPs). Less energetic but 20-times more intense UVA (320-400 nm) also induces the formation of CPDs together with a wide variety of oxidatively generated lesions such as single strand breaks and oxidized bases. Among those, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) is the most frequent since it can be produced by several mechanisms. Data available on the respective yield of DNA photoproducts in cells and skin show that exposure to sunlight mostly induces pyrimidine dimers, which explains the mutational signature found in skin tumors, with lower amounts of 8-oxoGua and strand breaks. The present review aims at describing the basic photochemistry of DNA and discussing the quantitative formation of the different UV-induced DNA lesions reported in the literature. Additional information on mutagenesis, repair and photoprotection is briefly provided.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29450111": "Photolyases (PHRs) and cryptochromes (CRYs) belong to the same family known as blue-light photoreceptors. Although their amino acid sequences and corresponding structures are similar to each other, they exert different functions. PHRs function as an enzyme to repair UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lesions such as a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and a (6-4) photoproduct ((6-4)pp), whereas CRYs are a circadian photoreceptor in plants and animals and at the same time they control the photoperiodic induction of flowering in plants. When a new type cryptochrome was identified, it was assumed that another type of CRYs, cryptochrome-DASH (CRY-DASH), which is categorized as a subfamily of photolyase/cryptochrome family, would possess the DNA photolyase activity. However, CRY-DASH had a weak DNA photolyase activity, but the reason for this is still unclear. To clarify the reason, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a complex of CPD-PHR or CRY-DASH with damaged double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and estimated the binding free energy, \u0394<i>G</i><sub>bind</sub>, between the protein and the damaged dsDNA by using a molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method. \u0394<i>G</i><sub>bind</sub> for both proteins were -35 and 57 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, indicating that the structural stability of CRY-DASH was lower than that of CPD-PHR upon the damaged dsDNA binding. In particular, the number of amino acid residues relevant to the damaged dsDNA binding on the CRY-DASH surface was smaller than that on CPD-PHR. Therefore, the present result suggests that CRY-DASH has a weak DNA photolyase activity because it has a lower binding affinity than CPD-PHR.",

It is an adenosine receptor A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists that will represent an important option for patients with advanced PD where it has been demonstrated efficacy in decreasing daily OFF time and is well tolerated. ISD has been marketed in Japan since May 2013. Areas covered: The objective of this review is to summarize evidences emerged from clinical studies that have demonstrated the efficacy of ISD in advanced parkinsonian patients. It will then focus on the potential role in treating non-motor symptoms (NMS) and cognitive decline, which heavily affect quality of life for PD patients. Its putative role as neuroprotective agent will also be discussed. Expert opinion: ISD might represent an alternative option for patients with advanced PD. The reduction of OFF time highlighted in pivotal trials is comparable to that obtained with different levodopa adjunct therapies. The low profile of side effects makes ISD a more suitable drug for advanced patients whose illness is complicated by depression or cognitive impairment.

These and other functions of stress granules facilitate an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by TPEN. In addition, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is released in cells treated with arsenite, before stress granule formation. These findings suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is a physiological ligand of TIA-1, acting as a stress-inducible second messenger to promote multimerization of TIA-1 and subsequent localization into stress granules.",

To investigate the role of Rbfox2 in stress granules we used RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify cytoplasmic transcriptome-wide targets of Rbfox2. We report that a subset of cell cycle-related genes including retinoblastoma 1 is the target of Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules, and Rbfox2 regulates the retinoblastoma 1 mRNA and protein expression levels during and following stress exposure. Our study proposes a novel function for Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules.",

This has allowed identification of asymptomatic mutation carriers, which may be of help in understanding the molecular changes preceding disease onset. We studied the cellular expression of FUS protein and the effect of heat-shock- and dithiothreitol-induced stress in fibroblasts from FUS P525L mutation carriers, healthy controls, and patients with sporadic ALS. Western blots and immunocytochemistry were performed to study the subcellular localization of FUS protein. Control and stressed cells were double stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R. Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead, most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts, the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients. We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist longer, than in controls and ALS cases. These data represent an early molecular change occurring before ALS onset, suggesting a transient preaggregative state.",

However, the exact function of this punctate pattern in cytoplasm during EV71 infection remains unknown. In this study, we firstly have examined this punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs). Sam68, belongs to the KH domain family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), was then confirmed that its KH domain was essential for this recruitment. Nevertheless, Knockdown of Sam68 expression using ShRNA had no effects on SGs assembly, indicating that Sam68 is not a constitutive component of the SGs during EV71 infection. Lastly, we investigated the importance of microtubulin transport to SGs aggregation, and revealed that microtubule depolymerization inhibited SGs formation, suggesting that EV71-induced SGs move throughout the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner. Taken together, these results illuminated that EV71 infections can induce SGs formation, and Sam68, as a SGs component, migrates alone with SGs dependent on intact microtubule upon the viral infections. These findings may provide novel underlying mechanism for delineating the role of SGs during EV71 infection.",

In this study, we found that SGs formed in cells infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), evidenced with the co-localization of some accepted SG markers in the viral infection-induced granules. We further discovered that adenosine-uridine (AU)-rich element RNA binding factor 1 (AUF1), which can bind to mRNAs and regulate their translation, was recruited to the SGs in response to high dose of CVB3 by detecting the co-localization of AUF1 with SG markers. Similar results were also observed in the enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected cells. Finally, we demonstrated that AUF1 was also recruited to arsenite-induced SGs, suggesting that the recruitment of AUF1 to SG is not a specific response to viral infection. In summary, our data indicate that both CVB3 and EV71 infections can induce SG formation, and AUF1 is a novel SG component upon the viral infections.

However, although numerous RNAs may undergo hyper-editing, the role for inosine-containing hyper-edited double-stranded RNA in cells is poorly understood. Nevertheless, editing plays a critical role in mammalian cells, as highlighted by the analysis of ADAR-null mutants. In particular, the long form of ADAR1 (ADAR1(p150)) is essential for viability. Moreover, a number of studies have implicated ADAR1(p150) in various stress pathways. We have previously shown that ADAR1(p150) localized to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. Here, we show that the Z-DNA-binding domain (Z\u03b1(ADAR1)) exclusively found in ADAR1(p150) is required for its localization to stress granules. Moreover, we show that fusion of Z\u03b1(ADAR1) to either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or polypyrimidine binding protein 4 (PTB4) also results in their localization to stress granules. We additionally show that the Z\u03b1 domain from other Z-DNA-binding proteins (ZBP1, E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules. Finally, we show that Z-RNA or Z-DNA binding is important for stress granule localization. We have thus identified a novel role for Z-DNA-binding domains in mammalian cells.",

FUS is a predominantly nuclear DNA- and RNA-binding protein that is involved in RNA processing. Large FUS-immunoreactive inclusions fill the perikaryon of surviving motor neurons of ALS patients carrying mutations at post-mortem. This sequestration of FUS is predicted to disrupt RNA processing and initiate neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. While FUS interacts with itself directly by protein-protein interaction, the recruitment of FUS to stress granules and interaction with PABP are RNA dependent. These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration.",

However, not all the induced genes undergo translation, and null mutants of many induced genes do not show elevated sensitivity to the particular stress. Elucidation of the RNA lifecycle reveals accumulation of non-translating mRNAs in cytoplasmic granules, P-bodies, and stress granules for future regulation. P-bodies contain enzymes for mRNA degradation; under stress conditions mRNAs may be transferred to stress granules for storage and return to translation. Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is elevated by stress; and here we analyzed the steady state levels, decay, and subcellular localization of the mRNA of the gene encoding the F-box protein, UFO1, that is induced by stress. Using the MS2L mRNA reporter system UFO1 mRNA was observed in granules that colocalized with P-bodies and stress granules. These P-bodies stored diverse mRNAs. Granules of two mRNAs transported prior to translation, ASH1-MS2L and OXA1-MS2L, docked with P-bodies. HSP12 mRNA that gave rise to highly elevated protein levels was not observed in granules under these stress conditions. ecd3, pat1 double mutants that are defective in P-body formation were sensitive to mRNAs expressed ectopically from strong promoters. These highly expressed mRNAs showed elevated translation compared with wild-type cells, and the viability of the mutants was strongly reduced. ecd3, pat1 mutants also exhibited increased sensitivity to different stresses. Our interpretation is that sequestration of highly expressed mRNAs in P-bodies is essential for viability. Storage of mRNAs for future regulation may contribute to the discrepancy between the steady state levels of many stress-induced mRNAs and their proteins. Sorting of mRNAs for future translation or decay by individual cells could generate potentially different phenotypes in a genetically identical population and enhance its ability to withstand stress.",

In this study, based on the 60K BeadChip genotyping data of both commercial Large White (n=45) and local Tongcheng pigs (n=45), genetic differentiation coefficient Fst was applied to detect the selection signatures. Using gPLINK software to set quality control standards, a total of 34 304 SNPs were selected for statistical analysis. Fst values between two breeds were estimated with Genepop package and the average Fst value was 0.3209. Setting Fst&gt;0.7036 (1% of total number of Fst values) as selection threshold, 344 SNPs were obtained and SNP location annotation indicated that there were 79 candidate genes (Sus scrofa Build 9). Furthermore, network analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the preliminary results suggested that most genes were involved in growth, reproduction, and immune response, such as NCOA6, ERBB4, RUNX2, and APOB genes.

Based on selective sweep theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed. However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well as to resume long-running analyses after processor failures. In addition, the user can specify various demographic models via the command-line to calculate their theoretically expected site frequency spectra. Therefore, (in contrast to SweepFinder) the neutral site frequencies can optionally be directly calculated from a given demographic model. We show that an increase of sample size results in more precise detection of positive selection. Thus, the ability to analyze substantially larger sample sizes by using SweeD leads to more accurate sweep detection. We validate SweeD via simulations and by scanning the first chromosome from the 1000 human Genomes project for selective sweeps. We compare SweeD results with results from a linkage-disequilibrium-based approach and identify common outliers.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838885": " Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci, known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population. SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and divergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele frequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations of a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation. The program calculates the mean of heterozygosity and FST in a set of sliding windows of incrementally increasing sizes, and then builds a resampled distribution (the baseline) of random multi-locus sets matched to the sizes of sliding windows, using an unrestricted sampling. Percentiles of the values in the sliding windows are derived from the superimposed resampled distribution. The resampling can easily be scaled from 1 K to 100 M; the higher the number, the more precise the percentiles ascribed to the extreme observed values. The output from SmileFinder can be used to plot percentile values to look for population diversity and divergence patterns that may suggest past actions of positive selection along chromosome maps, and to compare lists of suspected candidate genes under random gene sets to test for the overrepresentation of these patterns among gene categories. Both applications of the algorithm have already been used in published studies. Here we present a publicly available, open source program that will serve as a useful tool for preliminary scans of selection using worldwide databases of human genetic variation, as well as population datasets for many non-human species, from which such data is rapidly emerging with the advent of new genotyping and sequencing technologies.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26862394": " Linkage disequilibrium is defined as the non-random associations of alleles at different loci, and it occurs when genotypes at the two loci depend on each other. The model of genetic hitchhiking predicts that strong positive selection affects the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around the site of a beneficial allele, resulting in specific motifs of correlation between neutral polymorphisms that surround the fixed beneficial allele. Increased levels of linkage disequilibrium are observed on the same side of a beneficial allele, and diminish between sites on different sides of a beneficial mutation. This specific pattern of linkage disequilibrium occurs more frequently when positive selection has acted on the population rather than under various neutral models. Thus, detecting such patterns could accurately reveal targets of positive selection along a recombining chromosome or a genome. Calculating linkage disequilibria in whole genomes is computationally expensive because allele correlations need to be evaluated for millions of pairs of sites. To analyze large datasets efficiently, algorithmic implementations used in modern population genetics need to exploit multiple cores of current workstations in a scalable way. However, population genomic datasets come in various types and shapes while typically showing SNP density heterogeneity, which makes the implementation of generally scalable parallel algorithms a challenging task. Here we present a series of four parallelization strategies targeting shared-memory systems for the computationally intensive problem of detecting genomic regions that have contributed to the past adaptation of the species, also referred to as regions that have undergone a selective sweep, based on linkage disequilibrium patterns. We provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed parallel algorithms for computing linkage disequilibrium, and outline the benefits of each approach. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests. The computational demands of selective sweep detection algorithms depend greatly on the SNP density heterogeneity and the data representation. Choosing the right parallel algorithm for the analysis can lead to significant processing time reduction and major energy savings. However, determining which parallel algorithm will execute more efficiently on a specific processor architecture and number of available cores for a particular dataset is not straightforward.",

The frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use combinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this survey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and classify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e., SFS-based vs. LD-based, as well as their capacity to analyze whole genomes or just subgenomic regions. Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on LD exhibit higher true positive rates than SFS-based ones under the model of a single sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is elevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to represent the null hypothesis. When the correct (or similar to the correct) demographic model is used instead, the false positive rates are considerably reduced. The accuracy of detecting the true target of selection is decreased in bottleneck scenarios. In terms of execution time, LD-based methods are typically faster than SFS-based methods, due to the nature of required arithmetic.",

Thirty-seven patients with primary SS were studied and compared with 120 patients with SLE and 21 patients with SLE and SS. The Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 20 with an additional question for fatigue was used to assess health status. The SLICC/ACR damage index with a supplementary oral section was used to assess end organ damage. For statistical analysis, logistic regression analysis, Fisher's exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis rank tests were applied. Patients in all 3 groups had reduced quality of life with respect to all aspects of functional status and well being. There was no difference between the groups. In the primary SS group, the greatest damage was in the oral section (62% of patients). The patients with SLE and SS had the greatest renal, peripheral vascular, and musculoskeletal damage (24, 19, 38% of patients, respectively) followed by the SLE group. Ocular damage was more common in the primary SS group, but that was due to older age in this group. Malignancy was most common in the primary SS group (11%). Other organ damage scores did not differ between groups. End organ damage is uncommon in primary SS (with the exception of oral damage), but the degree of functional ability is as great as in SLE.",

Observations from lupus centres worldwide revealed that the prevalence of damage occurring in the cardiovascular system in patients with SLE has increased over the past four decades. The results of a meta-analysis involving over 70 observational studies demonstrated that lupus-related organ damage involving the neuropsychiatric and renal systems also remains a major factor that limits survival improvement in patients with this disease. While efforts to halt acute lupus-related injury are continuing, through early diagnosis and effective use of immunosuppressive agents, a concomitant strategy to improve survival of patients with SLE would be early detection and timely treatment of lupus-related organ damage with meticulous monitoring. This Review discusses the pattern and trend of organ damage in patients with SLE worldwide, the potential serological and genetic mechanisms of organ damage, and the advances in research on potential tools for early detection of lupus-related organ damage, such as functional brain imaging techniques, measurement of endothelial function, identification of biomarkers from body fluids, and development of risk calculation models.",

Herein we present an exceptionally rare case of an Amyand's hernia containing acute appendicitis and a perforated cecum. A 46-year-old male with a right inguinal hernia of 2-3 year duration presented to our Emergency Department complaining of acute onset abdominal and groin pain. The patient was diagnosed with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia and underwent emergent surgical repair. Intraoperatively a reactive fluid was found within the hernia sac that prompted an exploratory laparotomy for suspected bowel perforation. The hernia was then found to contain an inflamed gangrenous appendix with an inflamed and perforated cecum. An ileocecectomy and enteroenterostomy was performed and the hernia defect was repaired without mesh. With an estimated incidence of only 1%, Amyand's hernias are rare and lack a clear evidence-based management scheme. Moreover, they can contain a diverse range of pathologic features and presentations that can complicate diagnosis and treatment. To avoid potential morbidity and mortality, the surgeon must consider an Amyand's hernia on his or her differential when operating on inguinal hernias and be aware of the associated presentations, complications, and management schemes.

This study used demographic, mortality and medical records data of 1915 patients with lupus from the Lupus Family Registry and Repository. The data were randomly split (2:1 ratio) into independent training and validation sets. A logistic regression with ridge penalty was used to model the probability of being prescribed major immunosuppressive drugs-a surrogate indicator of lupus severity. ACR criteria and subcriteria were used as predictor variables in this model, and the resulting regression coefficient estimates obtained from the training data were used as item weightings to construct the severity index. The resulting index was tested on the independent validation dataset and was found to have high predictive accuracy for immunosuppressive use and early mortality. The index was also found to be strongly correlated with a previously existing severity score for lupus. In addition, demographic factors known to influence lupus severity (eg, age of onset, gender and ethnicity) all showed robust associations with our severity index that were consistent with observed clinical trends. This new index can be easily computed using ACR criteria, which may be among the most readily available data elements from patient medical records.

Two of the 3 patients remain in complete molecular response more than 12 months after stopping dasatinib. In these 2 patients we used highly sensitive patient-specific BCR-ABL1 DNA PCR to show that the leukemic clone remains detectable, as we have previously shown in imatinib-treated patients. Dasatinib-associated immunological phenomena, such as the emergence of clonal T-cell populations, were observed both in one patient who relapsed and in one patient in remission.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting up-regulated profibrotic pathways, such as imatinib mesylate, have been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for patients with scGVHD. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI with a well-established safety and efficacy profile in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, who are refractory or intolerant to imatinib, has also shown potent antifibrotic effects. We present here the first direct clinical evidence, from 3 patients treated in a small single-center series, suggesting that dasatinib can be a therapeutic option for patients with severe scGVHD resistant or intolerant to imatinib. All patients achieved partial response, with improvement in scGHVD target organs severity, joint mobility, lung impairment, and deep fibrotic lesions. This clinical response has remained stable or continued to improve after a median of 22 months (20-25) on dasatinib treatment, with very good tolerance.

This clinical evidence suggests that dasatinib could be a safe and effective alternative for scGVHD patients refractory to corticosteroids and resistant or intolerant to imatinib.

These mutations, which occur in the RING finger and linker domains, abolish the ability of c-Cbl to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and downregulate activated protein tyrosine kinases. Here we analyzed the effects of dasatinib in a c-Cbl RING finger mutant mouse that develops an MPD with a phenotype similar to the human MPDs. The mice are characterized by enhanced tyrosine kinase signaling resulting in an expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors and cells within the myeloid lineage. Since c-Cbl is a negative regulator of c-Kit and Src signaling we reasoned that dasatinib, which targets these kinases, would be an effective therapy. Furthermore, two recent studies showed dasatinib to be effective in inhibiting the in vitro growth of cells from leukemia patients with c-Cbl RING finger and linker domain mutations. Surprisingly we found that dasatinib did not provide an effective therapy for c-Cbl RING finger mutant mice since it did not suppress any of the hematopoietic lineages that promote MPD development. Thus we conclude that dasatinib may not be an appropriate therapy for leukemia patients with c-Cbl mutations. We did however find that dasatinib caused a marked reduction of pre-B cells and immature B cells which correlated with a loss of Src activity. This study is therefore the first to provide a detailed characterization of in vivo effects of dasatinib in a hematopoietic disorder that is driven by protein tyrosine kinases other than BCR-ABL.",

Improvers mapped to the fibroproliferative or normal-like subsets, while seven out of nine non-improvers were in the inflammatory subset (p = 0.0455). Improvers showed stability in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), while both measures showed a decline in non-improvers (p = 0.1289 and p = 0.0195, respectively). Inflammatory gene expression subset was associated with higher baseline HRCT score (p = 0.0556). Non-improvers showed significant increase in lung fibrosis (p = 0.0313).

Patients in the inflammatory gene expression subset showed increase in skin fibrosis, decreasing pulmonary function and worsening lung fibrosis during the study.

Nondysplastic UC lesions had 10-fold lower \u03b3H2AX expression and approximately 4-fold higher NUCKS1 expression compared with sporadic CRC, indicating minimal DNA DSB damage and heightened DNA DSB repair in these lesions, respectively. NUCKS1 expression in UC tended to decrease with increasing grades of dysplasia, whereas \u03b3H2AX, hTERT, and TP53 expression tended to increase with increasing grades of dysplasia. The highest \u03b3H2AX expression was seen in sporadic CRC, indicating considerable DNA DSB damage, whereas the highest NUCKS1 expression and hTERT expression were seen in nondysplastic UC. Overall, our data suggest that NUCKS1 may be involved in DNA DSB repair and/or inflammatory signaling in UC, but a more thorough investigation of both pathways in UC is warranted.",

It is known that liver regeneration following APAP-induced ALF is a deciding factor in the final outcome. Previous studies from our laboratory using an incremental dose model involving a regenerating (300 mg/kg, APAP300) and a nonregenerating (600 mg/kg, APAP600) dose of APAP in mice have revealed several proregenerative pathways that regulate regeneration after APAP overdose. Here we report that DNA damage and repair mechanisms regulate initiation of liver regeneration following APAP overdose. Mice treated with nonregenerating APAP600 dose showed prolonged expression of pH2AX, a marker of the DNA double-strand break (DSB), compared with APAP300. In regenerating APAP300 dose-treated mice, H2AX was rapidly dephosphorylated at Tyr142, indicating timely DNA repair. Expression of several DNA repair proteins was substantially lower with APAP600. Poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) activation, involved in DNA repair, was significantly higher in the APAP300 group compared to the APAP600 group. Activation of p53, the major cell cycle checkpoint protein, was significantly higher with APAP600 as demonstrated by substantially higher expression of its target genes. Taken together, these data show that massive DNA DSB occurs in high-dose APAP toxicity, and lack of prompt DSB repair after APAP overdose leads to prolonged growth arrest and proliferative senescence, resulting in inhibited liver regeneration.",

Their functions are still largely unknown. Thus, there exists a need to systematically investigate their roles in genomes. Towards this direction, identifying sets of CNEs in a wide range of organisms is an important first step. Currently, there are no tools published in the literature for systematically identifying CNEs in genomes. We fill this gap by presenting CNEFinder; a tool for identifying CNEs between two given DNA sequences with user-defined criteria. The results presented here show the tool's ability of identifying CNEs accurately and efficiently. CNEFinder is based on a k-mer technique for computing maximal exact matches. The tool thus does not require or compute whole-genome alignments or indexes, such as the suffix array or the Burrows Wheeler Transform (BWT), which makes it flexible to use on a wide scale.

In this respect, mutation analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may be desirable since they may provide real-time information on patient's disease status. Blood samples were collected from 37 patients enrolled in the TRIGGER study, a prospective phase II multi-center trial of erlotinib treatment in advanced NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations in tumor tissue. 10 CTC preparations from breast cancer patients without EGFR mutations in their primary tumors and 12 blood samples from healthy subjects were analyzed as negative controls. CTC preparations, obtained by the Veridex CellSearch System, were subjected to ultra-deep next generation sequencing (NGS) on the Roche 454 GS junior platform. CTCs fulfilling all Veridex criteria were present in 41% of the patients examined, ranging in number between 1 and 29. In addition to validated CTCs, potential neoplastic elements were seen in 33 cases. These included cells not fulfilling all Veridex criteria (also known as \"suspicious objects\") found in 5 (13%) of 37 cases, and isolated or clustered large naked nuclei with irregular shape observed in 33 (89%) cases. EGFR mutations were identified by NGS in CTC preparations of 31 (84%) patients, corresponding to those present in matching tumor tissue. Twenty-five (96%) of 26 deletions at exon 19 and 6 (55%) of 11 mutations at exon 21 were detectable (P = 0.005). In 4 (13%) cases, multiple EGFR mutations, suggesting CTC heterogeneity, were documented. No mutations were found in control samples.

One ml of plasma from 12 NSCLC patients, with different mutations and treatments (and 6 healthy donors as controls), were used as exosome sources. After RNAse treatment, in order to degrade circulating miRNAs, the exosomes were isolated with a commercial kit and resuspended in specific buffers for further analysis. The exosomes were characterized by western blotting for ALIX and TSG101 and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, the standard techniques to obtain biochemical and dimensional data of these nanovesicles. Total RNA extraction was performed with a high yield commercial kit.

To address this item, we exploited here a single-tube liquid biopsy, to detect both epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive CTCs and EpCAM-low/negative CTCs, because down-modulation of EpCAM is considered the first step in EMT. Furthermore, we analyzed the DNA from CTCs of four different phenotypes (ctcDNA), according to their EpCAM expression and cytokeratin pattern, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), in order to disclose activating and resistance-driving mutations. Liquid biopsy reflected spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the tumor under treatment pressure.

The 4D-CHAINS algorithm analyzes two 4D spectra recorded using a single, fully protonated protein sample in an iterative ansatz where common NOEs between different spin systems supplement conventional through-bond connectivities to establish assignments of sidechain and backbone resonances at high levels of completeness and with a minimum error rate. The 4D-CHAINS assignments are then used to guide automated assignment of long-range NOEs and structure refinement in autoNOE-Rosetta.

We present detailed phenotypic information on seven unrelated individuals with a recurrent de novo nonsense variant (c.2737C&gt;T [p.Arg913Ter]) in the penultimate exon of ZSWIM6 who have severe-profound intellectual disability and additional central and peripheral nervous system symptoms but an absence of frontonasal or limb malformations.

Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve genome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path based on super-resolution microscopy images.",

The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years.

For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other radionuclides that may be released.

The mRNA levels were determined by qPCR. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK was performed to further examine the exact mechanism of LB100 in NAFLD. LB100 significantly ameliorated HFD-induced obesity, hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatic injury in mice. In addition, LB100 significantly downregulated the protein levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and its lipogenesis target genes, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and fatty acid synthase, and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1\u03b1, acyl-CoA oxidase 1 and uncoupling protein 2, as well as the upstream mediators Sirt1 and AMPK\u03b1 in the livers of HFD-fed mice. <i>In vitro</i>, LB100 alleviated FFA-induced lipid accumulation in L02 cells through the AMPK/Sirt1 signaling pathway.

This implies that expression of MHC class I molecules on tumours is also mandatory for an effective T cell response against neoplasias. Indeed, numerous murine models exist (such as IC9, 3LL, P815) in which the existence of MHC presented tumour antigens and a protective CTL response have been well documented (reviewed in H\u00e4mmerling et al, 1987). However, the key question of whether cytolytic T cell attack has a role in human cancer remains unsolved. Similarly, the role of NK cells is unclear; these seem to lyse cells with low levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with biological signs of an increased grade of malignancy. Consequences of defective MHC class I expression for the survival of a malignant clone may theoretically consist of an escape from cytotoxic T cell attack or in an increased susceptibility for NK mediated lysis. In view of the fact that a particular antigen in a cell will be presented only by one or few HLA alleles on the cell, one would not expect that immunoselection would lead to a loss of all HLA alleles. It can be deduced from the few existing clinical studies on the prognostic impact of aberrant MHC class I expression that immunoselection by one way or the other is not a relevant mechanism in terms of tumour biology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

These CTLs recognize short peptides derived from tumour-associated antigens in conjunction with class I molecules expressed on tumour cells. In contrast to these observations there are now numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence. These minigene transfected BL cells were not only susceptible to lysis by virus-specific CTL but were also capable of efficiently activating an antigen-specific CTL response. Interestingly, the immunogenicity of these BL cells was not affected by the significantly down-regulated expression of adhesion molecules such as LFA1 alpha, LFA1 beta and LFA3. These findings suggest that resistance of tumour cells to CTL-mediated immune control can be reversed if the relevant peptide epitopes are appropriately presented on the cell surface.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18031135": "This review summarises the evolution of recent major advances in cancer immunotherapy, using metastatic melanoma as a model. The first true clinical progress with immunotherapy developed from the application of recombinant DNA technology for the large scale production of immunostimulant cytokines. Clinical trials demonstrated that the systemic administration of recombinant high-dose bolus intravenous interleukin-2 (IL-2; 720 000 IU/kg every 8 hours) mediated objective tumour progression in 20% of patients with metastatic renal cancer and in 17% of patients with metastatic melanoma, with complete responses of 9% and 7%, respectively. The use of adoptive immunotherapy (the transfer of immune cells with anti-tumour activity to the tumour-bearing host) focused interest on T lymphocyte-mediated tumour recognition. Clinical trials described the systemic administration of lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and subsequently tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) to patients with advanced cancer. Although able to kill tumour targets in vitro, LAK cells did not prove useful for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cancer. A randomised trial, in which IL-2 was administered alone or with LAK cells, failed to show a difference in response rate or survival. In contrast, the treatment of 86 patients with metastatic melanoma using TIL plus IL-2 resulted in a 34% objective response rate, which included patients who had previously failed treatment with high-dose IL-2 alone. The focus on cellular immune responses, combined with rapid biotechnological advances, resulted in the identification of tumour specific antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, that could be recognised by autologous TIL. This provided fundamental evidence of the existence of melanoma-associated antigens that were recognised in vivo by effector cells of the immune system. In vitro studies demonstrated immunodominant epitopes from MART-1 and gp100 that could induce in vitro-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte reactivity. To enhance in vitro immunogenicity, single amino acid substitutions were made to identify peptides with higher affinity for HLA-A*0201. Modified peptides from gp100 were compared with the parental peptide for increased immunogenicity based on their ability to induce anti-tumour lymphocytes in vitro. From these studies, a candidate peptide was identified (G9-209-2M) which had increased immunogenic reactivity in vitro. Clinical trials demonstrated that the modified G9-209-2M peptide was more effective. Unfortunately, objective tumour regression was still low. However, when high-dose IL-2 was combined with G9-209-2M objective clinical responses increased to 42%. Efforts to find better ways to immunise against self antigens are ongoing and involve further peptide immunisations, as well as recombinant viral vectors, adjuvant cytokine therapy and cellular adjuvants such as dendritic cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11599633": "The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination. The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen, immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity, because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy, mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only tumour-specific, but also individual-specific. Therapeutic vaccination will probably focus on defined antigens offered as protein, peptide or nucleic acid. Irrespective of the form in which the antigen is applied, emphasis will be given to the activation of dendritic cells as professional antigen presenters. Dendritic cells may be loaded in vitro with antigen, or, alternatively, initiation of an immune response may be approached in vivo by vaccination with RNA or DNA, given as such or packed into attenuated bacteria. The importance of activation of T helper cells has only recently been taken into account in cancer vaccination. Activation of cytotoxic T cells is facilitated by the provision of T helper cell-derived cytokines. T helper cell-dependent recruitment of elements of non-adaptive defence, such as leucocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes, is of particular importance when the tumour has lost MHC class I expression. Barriers to successful therapeutic vaccination include: (i) the escape mechanisms developed by tumour cells in response to immune attack; (ii) tolerance or anergy of the evoked immune response; (iii) the theoretical possibility of provoking an autoimmune reaction by vaccination against tumour-associated antigens; and (iv) the advanced age of many patients, implying reduced responsiveness of the senescent immune system.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21388431": "The potential for cancer immunotherapy by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells is gaining increased attention. Most cancer cells lack major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and cannot present tumour-specific antigens (TSA) directly to CD4(+) T cells. We have reported that tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells collaborate with macrophages and dendritic cells. These professional antigen-presenting cells endocytose and process TSA to display antigenic peptides on their MHC class II molecules for indirect cancer cell recognition by CD4(+) T cells. We hypothesized that this critical step may depend on secretion of TSA by cancer cells. This was investigated in a mouse model for myeloma immunosurveillance mediated by CD4(+) T cells. From this study, several conclusions could be drawn. First, TSA secretion facilitates cancer immunosurveillance. Second, TSA secretion results in stronger activation of na\u00efve tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells in lymph nodes. Third, TSA concentration within the tumour extracellular matrix must reach a certain threshold to allow successful cancer immunosurveillance. Fourth, treatment by local injection of purified TSA enhances immunity against cancer cells that do not secrete TSA. Fifth, secretion of TSA by at least some cancer cells within a tumour favours antitumour immunity. Therefore, we propose that CD4(+) T cells that recognize secreted TSA may be superior for immunotherapy by T cell transfer, because the local extracellular antigen concentration will be higher for secreted TSA. Thus, it is anticipated that secreted TSA will be more readily detected in vivo by transferred CD4(+) T cells, resulting in more efficient tumour eradication.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23561850": " Microsatellite instability (MSI) resulting from loss of functional DNA mismatch repair was recently found in various haematological disorders. In coding sequences, MSI leads to frameshift mutations (FSMs) and the production of C-terminally altered proteins which are foreign to the immune system. Here, we wondered whether these frame-shifted peptide (FSP) sequences represent tumour-specific antigens also for MSI(+) leukaemia and lymphomas (L/L). A total of 33 coding region microsatellites were examined in MSI(+) L/L cell lines for the presence of FSMs. Thereafter, recognition of MSI(+) cells by established FSP-specific CD8(+) T cell lines was quantified using interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. In each experiment, MSI(+) L/L cell lines and T2 targets exogenously loaded with the cognate peptide (=internal control) were employed. Supplementary, lytic activity towards tumour cells was analysed by standard chromium release assay ((51)Cr). Mutational profiling of 33 coding microsatellite loci in nine MSI(+) L/L cell lines revealed instability in at least nine microsatellites. In each cell line, a distinct mutational profile was observed. Only three of the 33 loci were stable. FSP-specific and human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2)-restricted T cells specifically recognised MSI(+) L/L cells endogenously expressing TGF\u03b2RII(-1), Caspase 5 (-1) and MSH3 (-1) in ELISpot assays. Moreover, specific killing of Caspase 5 (-1) and MSH3 (-1) expressing L/L cell lines was achieved in functional cytotoxicity assays. Data presented here expand the importance of FSPs as shared and general tumour-specific antigens. Consequently, they open new avenues for specific immunotherapies not only for solid but also for MSI(+) haematological malignancies.",

We aimed to identify the genetic basis of this syndrome by sequencing most coding exons in affected individuals. Through a search of available case studies and communication with collaborators, we identified families that included at least one individual with at least three of the five main features of the DOORS syndrome: deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, intellectual disability, and seizures. Participants were recruited from 26 centres in 17 countries. Families described in this study were enrolled between Dec 1, 2010, and March 1, 2013. Collaborating physicians enrolling participants obtained clinical information and DNA samples from the affected child and both parents if possible. We did whole-exome sequencing in affected individuals as they were enrolled, until we identified a candidate gene, and Sanger sequencing to confirm mutations. We did expression studies in human fibroblasts from one individual by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, and in mouse tissues by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. 26 families were included in the study. We did exome sequencing in the first 17 enrolled families; we screened for TBC1D24 by Sanger sequencing in subsequent families. We identified TBC1D24 mutations in 11 individuals from nine families (by exome sequencing in seven families, and Sanger sequencing in two families). 18 families had individuals with all five main features of DOORS syndrome, and TBC1D24 mutations were identified in half of these families. The seizure types in individuals with TBC1D24 mutations included generalised tonic-clonic, complex partial, focal clonic, and infantile spasms. Of the 18 individuals with DOORS syndrome from 17 families without TBC1D24 mutations, eight did not have seizures and three did not have deafness. In expression studies, some mutations abrogated TBC1D24 mRNA stability. We also detected Tbc1d24 expression in mouse phalangeal chondrocytes and calvaria, which suggests a role of TBC1D24 in skeletogenesis. Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes. Thus, individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness and seizures but with the other features should still be screened for TBC1D24 mutations. More information is needed to understand the cellular roles of TBC1D24 and identify the genes responsible for DOORS phenotypes in individuals who do not have a mutation in TBC1D24.

CSS is a rare congenital malformation syndrome characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability (ID), coarse facial appearance, feeding difficulties, frequent infections, and hypoplasia/aplasia of the fifth fingernails and fifth distal phalanges. In 2012, 42 years after the first description of CSS in 1970, five causative genes (SMARCB1, SMARCE1, SMARCA4, ARID1A, ARID1B), all encoding components of the BAF complex, were identified as being responsible for CSS through whole exome sequencing and pathway-based genetic screening. The identification of two additional causative genes (PHF6, SOX11) followed. Mutations in another BAF complex gene (SMARCA2) and (TBC1D24) were found to cause clinically similar conditions with ID, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome and DOORS syndrome, respectively. Also, ADNP was found to be mutated in an autism/ID syndrome. Furthermore, there is growing evidences for germline or somatic mutations in the BAF complex genes to be causal for cancer/cancer predisposition syndromes. These discoveries have highlighted the role of the BAF complex in the human development and cancer formation. The biology of BAF is very complicated and much remains unknown. Ongoing research is required to reveal the whole picture of the BAF complex in human development, and will lead to the development of new targeted therapies for related disorders in the future.",

TBC1D24 has been implicated in neuronal transmission and maturation, although the molecular function of the gene and the cause of the apparently complex disease spectrum remain unclear. Importantly, heterozygous TBC1D24 mutation carriers have also been reported with seizures, suggesting that haploinsufficiency for TBC1D24 is significant clinically. Here we have systematically investigated an allelic series of disease-associated mutations in neurons alongside a new mouse model to investigate the consequences of TBC1D24 haploinsufficiency to mammalian neurodevelopment and synaptic physiology. The cellular studies reveal that disease-causing mutations that disrupt either of the conserved protein domains in TBC1D24 are implicated in neuronal development and survival and are likely acting as loss-of-function alleles. We then further investigated TBC1D24 haploinsufficiency in vivo and demonstrate that TBC1D24 is also crucial for normal presynaptic function: genetic disruption of Tbc1d24 expression in the mouse leads to an impairment of endocytosis and an enlarged endosomal compartment in neurons with a decrease in spontaneous neurotransmission. These data reveal the essential role for TBC1D24 at the mammalian synapse and help to define common synaptic mechanisms that could underlie the varied effects of TBC1D24 mutations in neurological disease.",

Advances in high-throughput approaches will underpin increased understanding of radiosensitivity and the development of future predictive assays for clinical application. There is an established contribution of genetics as a risk factor for radiotherapy side effects. An individual's radiosensitivity is an inherited polygenic trait with an architecture that includes rare mutations in a few genes that confer large effects and common variants in many genes with small effects. Current thinking is that some will be tissue specific, and future tests will be tailored to the normal tissues at risk. The relationship between normal and tumor cell radiosensitivity is poorly understood. Data are emerging suggesting interplay between germline genetic variation and epigenetic modification with growing evidence that changes in DNA methylation regulate the radiosensitivity of cancer cells and histone acetyltransferase inhibitors have radiosensitizing effects. Changes in histone methylation can also impair DNA damage response signaling and alter radiosensitivity. An important effort to advance radiobiology in the genomic era was establishment of the Radiogenomics Consortium to enable the creation of the large radiotherapy cohorts required to exploit advances in genomics. To address challenges in harmonizing data from multiple cohorts, the consortium established the REQUITE project to collect standardized data and genotyping for ~5,000 patients.

The principal rationale for a focus on toxicity in radiogenomics is that for many patients treated with radiation, especially individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancers, the survival rates are high, and therefore a substantial number of people will live for a significant period of time beyond treatment. However, many of these patients could suffer from debilitating complications resulting from radiotherapy. Work in radiogenomics has greatly benefited from creation of the Radiogenomics Consortium (RGC) that includes investigators at multiple institutions located in a variety of countries. The common goal of the RGC membership is to share biospecimens and data so as to achieve large-scale studies with increased statistical power to enable identification of relevant genomic markers. A major aim of research in radiogenomics is the development of a predictive instrument to enable identification of people who are at greatest risk for adverse effects resulting from cancer treatment using radiation.

Here, the risk to develop severe side effects is continuous, with increasing incidences of side effects with higher doses and/or volumes. In addition, a multi-SNP assay will produce a predicted probability of developing side effects and will require one or more cut-off thresholds for classifying risk into discrete categories. A classical biomarker trial design is therefore not optimal, whereas a risk factor stratification approach is more appropriate. Patient selection is crucial and this should be based on the dose-response relations for a specific endpoint. Alternatives to standard treatment should be available and this should take into account the preferences of patients. This will be discussed in detail.",

Prospectively assessed two-year toxicity endpoints (urinary frequency, decreased urine stream, rectal bleeding, overall toxicity) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were tested using multivariable regression, adjusting for clinical and patient-related risk factors. A fixed-effects meta-analysis identified two SNPs: rs17599026 on 5q31.2 with urinary frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-4.69, p-value 4.16\u00d710(-8)) and rs7720298 on 5p15.2 with decreased urine stream (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p-value=3.21\u00d710(-8)).

Estimates of whole-body effective dose are based on the assumptions that the radiation is incident from the front and in a uniform beam. We sought to investigate these assumptions and also to quantify doses associated with different activities. A single technologist wore 3 electronic dosimeters for 3 mo, at the front waist, the back waist, and the front collar. The technologist also recorded her activities throughout the day. We found that the assumption of an anterior beam held about two thirds of the time, breaking down only when the technologist was receiving lower doses. Overall, the average whole-body dose was estimated correctly by assuming an anterior beam. We also found that irradiation was uniform (i.e., waist and collar badges gave equivalent readings) except when the technologist was performing injections. Then, the collar readings were 1.7 times the waist readings. Finally, average doses were measured for different types of activities. Performing injections registered a dose rate of approximately 2 microSv/h. Doses received while scanning ranged from 0.2 to 2 microSv/h. The average dose for a scan depended not only on the administered activity and isotope but also on the amount of patient contact required. Even for high activities, such as patients who had already received therapy, the dose to the technologist was low for patients requiring little assistance. The assumption of anterior irradiation correctly estimates whole-body effective dose. The assumption of a uniform beam is good except when injections are being performed, when the upper torso receives a much higher dose than the waist. Overall, doses to the technologist were found to be 5.4 microSv/d for scanning and 12 microSv/d for injections. These correspond to 1.4 mSv/y and 3.2 mSv/y, respectively, which are comparable to naturally occurring radiation levels and are much lower than regulatory limits. However, if the dose to a particular technologist needs to be minimized (e.g., for a pregnant worker), the most effective strategy is for the technologist to be assigned patients requiring little contact or assistance and, in particular, to avoid administering injections.",

Changes in medical technology and practices have altered the radiation exposure environments to which a worker may have been exposed during their career. Other temporal factors include shifts in regulatory requirements that influenced the conduct of radiation monitoring and the changes in the measured dose quantities. The use of leaded aprons during exposure to lower energy X rays encountered in fluoroscopically based radiology adds complexity to account for the shielding of the organs located in the torso when dosimeters were worn over leaded aprons. Estimating doses to unshielded tissues such as the brain and lens of the eye become less challenging when dosimeters are worn at the collar above the apron.

A retrospective chart review. The study included a total of 142 patients with VS stage 1 or 2 according to the Koos classification and treated between January 2004 and December 2015. Microsurgery, radiotherapy and observation groups comprised 43, 46 and 53 patients, respectively. All patients completed four QOL (questionnaires: Short-Form Health Survey 36, Hearing Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short-Form). Clinical symptoms and QOL were compared among groups. The average time interval between management and filling in the questionnaires was 66 months. There was no difference in QOL between the three groups on any of the four questionnaires. The most debilitating symptom was vertigo for all three groups. Tinnitus was a pejorative factor in the surgery group. Hearing level was deteriorated after microsurgery but there was no significant difference between the radiotherapy group and the middle fossa approach. Patients with small VS stage 1 and 2 had similar QOL, irrespective of management by observation, radiotherapy or microsurgery. The overall predictor for long-term reduced QOL was vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation could improve QOL in symptomatic patients.",

While this classification system is widely reported in the literature, to date no study has assessed its reliability. To assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the Koos classification system. After institutional review board approval was obtained, a cross-sectional group of the Magnetic Resonance imagings of 40 patients with vestibular schwannomas varying in size comprised the study sample. Four raters were selected to assign a Koos grade to 50 total scans. Inter- and intrarater reliability were calculated and reported using Fleiss' kappa, Kendall's W, and Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Inter-rater reliability was found to be substantial when measured using Fleiss' kappa (.71), extremely strong using Kendall's W (.92), and excellent as calculated by ICC (.88).Intrarater reliability was perfect for 3 out of 4 raters as assessed using weighted kappa, Kendall's W and ICC, with the intrarater agreement for the fourth rater measured as extremely high. We have demonstrated that the Koos classification system for vestibular schwannoma is a reliable method for tumor classification. This study lends further support to the results of current literature using Koos grading system. Further studies are required to evaluate its validity and utility in counseling patients with regard to outcomes.",

Retrospective case study. Tertiary referral center. Eighteen patients who underwent a middle fossa craniotomy for vestibular schwannoma (stage I or II of Koos classification) with attempted hearing preservation from January 2008 to February 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Pre-surgical cVEMPs test, videonystagmography (caloric test), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as a pre- and post-surgical audiometry test. cVEMPs parameters including amplitude asymmetry ratio (AR), P13, and N23 latencies and peak-to-peak amplitude between P13 and N23 waves were calculated. Hearing data were classified according to the AAO-HNS hearing classes. The nerve of origin of the tumor was specified during surgery and the largest tumor diameter was measure on MRI axial plane on T2-CISS weighed images. Preoperative amplitude asymmetry ratio was lower (n = 15, Mann-Whitney U test, p &lt; 0.001) in the group with postoperative hearing preservation (n = 11) compared with the group with postoperative hearing preservation failure (n = 4). The positive predictive value of an AR less than 24% to assess postoperative hearing preservation is 91.6%. Tumor size and localization were not correlated with cVEMPs, nor with caloric testing in this group of small-sized intracanalicular vestibular schwannomas. Our data suggest that cVEMPs may help predict hearing preservation outcome in vestibular schwannoma surgery via the middle fossa craniotomy approach.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26697469": "Testing of tumor tissue remains the recommended method for detecting the presence of somatic mutations in human malignancies. V600E is the most frequent somatic point mutation in metastatic melanoma, providing a unique molecular marker for this malignancy. In addition, tumors carrying this mutation are primary candidates for BRAF-targeted therapy. Although metastatic melanoma patients usually have sufficient tumor tissue available for genetic analyses, the detection of V600E in blood can have prognostic and predictive value. In addition, patients are rarely re-biopsied and genetic testing in blood can be useful for monitoring response to therapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA), RNA associated to platelets and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are some of the materials that can be derived from the blood of cancer patients. cfDNA can be easily purified from serum and plasma and contains DNA fragments of tumor origin. For this reason, it is the most widely used material for the detection of somatic mutations in blood. Several methodologies have been used to determine V600E status in the cfDNA of metastatic melanoma and some studies have demonstrated that the identification and follow-up of V600E in cfDNA can have prognostic and predictive value.",

Because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with obtaining tumor tissues, especially in the case of metastatic disease, traditional methods for tumor sampling are impractical for this application. Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance. This substrate is amenable for inexpensive noninvasive testing and thus presents a viable approach to serial sampling for screening and monitoring tumor progression. The fragmentation, low yield, and variable admixture of normal DNA present formidable technical challenges for realization of this potential. This review summarizes the history of cfDNA discovery, its biological properties, and explores emerging technologies for clinically relevant sequence-based analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients. Molecular barcoding (or Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI)-based methods currently appear to offer an optimal balance between sensitivity, flexibility, and cost and constitute a promising approach for clinically relevant assays for near real-time monitoring of treatment-induced mutational adaptations to guide evidence-based precision oncology.

A range of unit costs were assigned to each item in the screening process. Detection rates were estimated by meta-analysis and modeling. The marginal cost associated with the detection of additional cases using cfDNA was estimated from the difference in average costs divided by the difference in detection. The main factor was the unit cost of cfDNA testing. For example, replacing a combined test costing $150 with 3% false-positive rate and invasive testing at $1000, by cfDNA tests at $2000, $1500, $1000, and $500, the marginal cost is $8.0, $5.8, $3.6, and $1.4m, respectively. Costs were lower when replacing a quadruple test and higher for a 5% false-positive rate, but the relative importance of cfDNA unit cost was unchanged. A contingent policy whereby 10% to 20% women were selected for cfDNA testing by conventional screening was considerably more cost-efficient. Costs were sensitive to cfDNA uptake. Universal cfDNA screening for Down syndrome will only become affordable by public health purchasers if costs fall substantially. Until this happens, the contingent use of cfDNA is recommended.",

Fetal monogenic diseases have also been shown to be amenable to non-invasive detection by maternal plasma DNA analysis. A number of recent technological developments in this area has increased the level of clinical interest, particularly as one approach does not require customized reagents per mutation. The mutational status of the fetus can be assessed by determining which parental haplotype that fetus has inherited based on the detection of haplotype-associated SNP alleles in maternal plasma. Such relative haplotype dosage analysis requires the input of the parental haplotype information for interpretation of the fetal inheritance pattern from the maternal plasma DNA data. The parental haplotype information can be obtained by direct means, reducing the need to infer haplotypes using DNA from other family members. The technique also allows the assessment of complex mutations and has multiplexing capabilities where a number of genes and mutations can be assessed at the same time. These advantages allow non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal monogenic diseases to be much more scalable. These applications may drive the next wave of clinical adoption of cell-free fetal DNA testing. \u00a9 2018 The Authors Prenatal Diagnosis Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",

The present study examined the efficacy of amantadine in alleviating the postoperative pain of mandibular fracture surgery. In this double-blind study, 60 patients (ASA physical status I-II) were randomly divided into two groups. The mean ages of the participants were 31.2 \u00b1 13.1 years and 32.3 \u00b1 18.1 years, respectively. The male/female ratios were 24/6 and 26/4, respectively, in the case and control groups. Randomization was based on a single sequence of random assignments using computer-generated random numbers. Group I was given oral amantadine 100 mg 1 hour before surgery, and group II received a placebo at the identical time. Through PCA pumps, patients received a bolus dose of morphine at 0.02 mg/kg body weight, to a maximum of 1.5 mg. PCA pumps were set at 6 minutes lockout intervals and a maximum dose of 0.15 mg/kg/h, to a maximum of 10 mg/h. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after surgery. The amounts of analgesic consumed were recorded for the first 24 hours, and for 6 months after surgery. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, gender, nausea and vomiting, sleep quality, blood pressure, and heart rate. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in pain scores (P = 0.39) and analgesic consumption (P = 0.78). The results suggest that a single dose of preoperative oral amantadine did not reduce acute or chronic postoperative pain, nor analgesic consumption.",

Three indices were identified which could adequately describe outcome (disease activity, damage from disease, and health status); we describe here the development of the Disease Activity Index. Twenty-four variables were identified as important factors in a disease activity index. These were used to generate 574 patient profiles, which were rated on a disease activity scale of 0-10 by 14 rheumatologists. A second rating of 10 of the profiles yielded scores that were not significantly different from the first, indicating that experienced clinicians can reliably make global estimates of disease activity. Multiple regression models were used to estimate the relative importance of the 24 clinical variables in the physicians' global rating of disease activity. These were estimated on a \"training set\" of 75% of physicians' ratings, and then validated on a \"testing set,\" consisting of the remaining 25% of physicians' ratings. The explanatory power of the models in the training set was high (R2 = 0.93). The models' regression coefficients for the organ systems were simplified for easier use in clinical practice. This generated a \"weighted\" index of 9 organ systems for disease activity in SLE, the SLEDAI, as follows: 8 for central nervous system and vascular, 4 for renal and musculoskeletal, 2 for serosal, dermal, immunologic, and 1 for constitutional and hematologic. The maximum theoretical score is 105, but in practice, few patients have scores greater than 45. The SLEDAI predicted well the physicians' ratings in the testing set (Pearson's correlation coefficients = 0.64-0.79).

Clinical and laboratory information necessary to compute the SLEDAI-2K and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index was collected prospectively and entered onto a computerized database. Patients followed for a minimum of 3 visits, and without absence for a period &gt; 18 consecutive months, were included in the study. Six different approaches to measure variability of SLEDAI-2K were evaluated for each visit, along with AMS. Approaches were the standard deviation, the slope, average rate of change by visit, the range, the coefficient of variation, and the Percentage of the visits with a change in SLEDAI-2K &gt; or = 3. The SLE outcomes under study were death, presence of damage, coronary artery disease (CAD), and osteonecrosis (ON). The predictability of each outcome was evaluated through time-dependent covariate survival analyses. Regression models included other known major risk factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, SLEDAI-2K at presentation, and disease duration. Five hundred seventy-five patients seen from 1970 to 2002 were included. The average time between visits was 4.0 +/- 2.2 months. Eighty-five patients died, 325 developed damage, 55 had CAD, and 68 had ON. None of the 6 variability measures added more statistical significance in the prediction of any of the 4 outcomes.

We seek to assess whether a polypill containing fixed doses of three antihypertensive agents, a statin and antiplatelet therapy taken once daily per os for 12 months among recent stroke survivors would result in carotid intimal thickness regression compared with usual care (UC). The Stroke Minimization through Additive Anti-atherosclerotic Agents in Routine Treatment (SMAART) trial is a phase 2, open-label, evaluator-blinded trial involving 120 Ghanaian recent-ischemic-stroke survivors. Using a computer-generated sequence, patients will be randomly allocated 1:1 into either the intervention arm or UC. Patients in the intervention arm will receive Polycap DS\u00ae (containing aspirin, 100 mg; atenolol, 50 mg; ramipril, 5 mg; thiazide, 12.5 mg; simvastatin, 20 mg) taken as two capsules once daily. Patients in the UC will receive separate, individual secondary preventive medications prescribed at the physician's discretion. Both groups will be followed for 12 months to assess changes in carotid intimal thickness regression - a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis - as primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include adherence to therapy, safety and tolerability, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, functional status, depression and cognitive dysfunction.

We examined the incremental effects of 2 (full dose) plus K(+) supplementation versus single polycap (low dose) on risk factors and tolerability. After a run-in period, 518 individuals with previous vascular disease or diabetes mellitus from 27 centers in India were randomly assigned to a single-dose polycap or to 2 capsules of the polycap plus K(+) supplementation for 8 weeks. The effects on BP, heart rate (HR), serum lipids, serum and urinary K(+), and tolerability were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis. The full-dose polycap (plus K(+) supplementation) reduced BP by a further 2.8 mm Hg systolic and 1.7 mm Hg diastolic, compared with that observed with the low-dose polycap (P=0.003; P=0.001), but there were no differences in HR (0.1 bpm). The differences in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol between the full-dose and low-dose polycap was 7.2 mg/dL (P=0.014) and 6.6 mg/dL (P=0.006), respectively, but there were no differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.

We evaluated the bioavailability of each ingredient of the Polycap and determined any drug-drug interactions relative to single component reference preparations. The bioavailability of the ingredients of the Polycap (T; test) when formulated as a single capsule was compared with that of identical capsules with each of its ingredients administered separately (R; reference) in a five-arm, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover trial with at least a 2-week washout period in a total of 195 healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations of each drug and, where applicable, its active metabolite were measured using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters and their standard deviations were computed for each analyte. Comparative bioavailability was computed and no drug-drug interactions and no difference in comparative bioavailability were concluded for each ingredient based on point estimates of the T/R ratio of the geometric means falling within 80-125% for peak plasma concentration (C(max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC(t)), and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)). The T/R ratio for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, ramiprilat and dose-normalized salicylic acid. However, for simvastatin, the T/R point estimates for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) for Ln-transformed data were significantly lower ( approximately 3-4%) than the lower bound of 80%. For its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, these estimates were significantly higher ( approximately 25-35%) than the higher bound of 125%. Thus, the increased bioavailability of active simvastatin acid appeared to compensate for the loss of bioavailability of simvastatin. The Polycap was found to be effective and safe in the previously published TIPS trial. The present study in healthy volunteers establishes that Polycap is safe (no serious adverse events) and well tolerated, and that there is no indication of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions for any of the ingredients, with their bioavailabilities being well preserved.",

They are dimeric recombinant fusion proteins composed of the extracellular domain of a human activin receptor (ActRIIA or IIB) linked to the Fc part of human IgG1. Sotatercept (ActRIIA-Fc) and Luspatercept (a modified ActRIIB-Fc) in particular are now in phase 2/3 of clinical trials against anemia and included in the prohibited list established by the World Anti-Doping Agency. To prevent a potential misuse by athletes in the near future, a robust and sensitive method of detection is needed. We validated an approach adapted from an electrophoretic method used for the detection of recombinant erythropoietins that allowed detection of various ActRIIA-Fc and ActRIIB-Fc proteins, including variants produced in different cell types, after a single immuno-extraction step. After separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), an initial testing procedure performed by single-blotting can indicate the presence of an ActRII-Fc (indifferently type IIA or IIB). A confirmation performed by double-blotting using different antibodies for detection allows a more precise identification of the type of ActRII-Fc (IIA, IIB). Starting from a few hundred microliters of serum or plasma, this method is specific, sensitive, and easy to perform. It could easily be adopted by anti-doping laboratories.",

The mechanism of the action of the novel drugs is incompletely understood, but it seems to be based on the inactivation of soluble proteins of the transforming growth factor-\u00df (TGF\u00df) family. This review considers pros and cons of the clinical use of the drugs in reference to the current therapy with recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). One or more activin type-II receptor (ActRII) ligands appear to inhibit erythroid precursors, for example growth and differentiation factor 11. Trapping of these ligands by the recombinant ActRII fusion proteins, sotatercept and luspatercept increases red blood cell numbers and hemoglobin levels in humans. Reportedly, the novel compounds were well tolerated in trials on healthy volunteers and patients suffering from anemia due to chronic kidney disease or malignancies. On approval, the drugs may prove particularly useful in patients suffering from ineffective erythropoiesis, such as in myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma or \u00df-thalassemia, where ESAs are of little use. Independent of their effect on erythropoiesis, ActRII ligand traps were found to exert beneficial effects on renal tissue in experimental animals. ESAs are likely to remain standard of care in renal anemia. There is a need for a better understanding of the effects of ActRII ligand traps on TGF\u00df-like proteins. The novel drugs have not been approved for sale as therapeutics so far. Their long-term efficacy and safety still needs to be proven, particularly with respect to immunogenicity. Antifibrotic effects may be worthy to be investigated in humans.",

However EPO-Fc, one of the prohibited rEPOs designated by WADA, is not detectable with the actual IEF conditions. Other newly developed ESAs - luspatercept and sotatercept, both activin receptor type II-Fc fusion proteins (ActRII-Fc) - are also now prohibited and could be used in combination with rEPOs. Methods of identification of ActRII-Fc in blood by SAR/SDS-PAGE have been described, but not by IEF. Here we detail improvements in blood sample preparation and IEF analysis: A combined immuno-purification of EPOs and ActRII-Fc proteins in a single procedure, an appropriate isoforms separation for all proteins using new pre-loading and gel conditions, and a single detection of all rEPOs and ActRII-Fc proteins after successive incubation with anti-EPO and anti-ActRII antibodies. With these changes, distinctive profiles for all the ESAs were obtained by IEF. Therefore, IEF could be used as a screening method to detect a wide spectrum of prohibited ESAs in blood samples prior to specific confirmation for the identified rEPO or ActRII-Fc.",

However, this puts lifelong demands not only on the patients but also on the health care systems that are tasked with delivering long-term treatment and comprehensive support. Prevention programs and curative approaches are therefore an important part of overall strategy. Curative treatments alter the dynamic of a patient's health care costs, from financial commitment over 50 years, into a potential \"one-off\" investment. Since the 1980s, this has usually been available only to the 30% or so of young children with matched sibling donors. By improving the safety of matched related donors and haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplants, the potential size of the donor pool for curative therapies may be increased. Recent advances in gene therapy demonstrate that even patients lacking a matched donor can be rendered transfusion independent with an autograft of genetically modified autologous stem cells, with a low short-term risk. Noncurative treatments are also of potential value by decreasing use of blood and chelators and decreasing hospital visits. An example is luspatercept, an activin-receptor trap that modifies transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling, thereby increasing the efficiency of erythropoiesis. This has entered phase 3 clinical trials for TDT and non-TDT and, usefully increases in both Hb and quality of life in non-TDT as well as decreasing transfusion requirements in TDT.

Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a novel fusion protein that blocks transforming growth factor beta (TGF \u03b2) superfamily inhibitors of erythropoiesis, giving rise to a promising new investigative therapy. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with anaemia due to lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. In this phase 2, multicentre, open-label, dose-finding study (PACE-MDS), with long-term extension, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had International Prognostic Scoring System-defined low or intermediate 1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (white blood cell count &lt;13 000/\u03bcL), and had anaemia with or without red blood cell transfusion support. Enrolled patients were classified as having low transfusion burden, defined as requiring less than 4 red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment (and baseline haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL), or high transfusion burden, defined as requiring 4 or more red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment. Patients received luspatercept subcutaneously once every 21 days at dose concentrations ranging from 0\u00b7125 mg/kg to 1\u00b775 mg/kg bodyweight for five doses (over a maximum of 12 weeks). Patients in the expansion cohort were treated with 1\u00b70 mg/kg luspatercept; dose titration up to 1\u00b775 mg/kg was allowed, and patients could be treated with luspatercept for a maximum of 5 years. Patients in the base study were assessed for response and safety after 12 weeks in order to be considered for enrolment into the extension study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving modified International Working Group-defined haematological improvement-erythroid (HI-E), defined as a haemoglobin concentration increase of 1\u00b75 g/dL or higher from baseline for 14 days or longer in low transfusion burden patients, and a reduction in red blood cell transfusion of 4 or more red blood cell units or a 50% or higher reduction in red blood cell units over 8 weeks versus pre-treatment transfusion burden in high transfusion burden patients. Patient data were subcategorised by: luspatercept dose concentrations (0\u00b7125-0\u00b75 mg/kg vs 0\u00b775-1\u00b775 mg/kg); pre-study transfusion burden (high transfusion burden vs low transfusion burden, defined as \u22654 vs &lt;4 red blood cell units per 8 weeks); pre-study serum erythropoietin concentration (&lt;200 IU/L, 200-500 IU/L, and &gt;500 IU/L); presence of 15% or more ring sideroblasts; and presence of SF3B1 mutations. Efficacy analyses were carried out on the efficacy evaluable and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is currently ongoing.

Three treatment-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in one patient each: myalgia (one [2%]), increased blast cell count (one [2%]), and general physical health deterioration (one [2%]). Two of these treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reversible serious grade 3 adverse events: one patient (2%) had myalgia and one patient (2%) had general physical health deterioration. Luspatercept was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of anaemia in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and so could therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of anaemia associated with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; further studies are ongoing.

Tissue bank samples of formalin fixed paraffin embedded neuroblastoma tissue from patients for whom clinical outcome data were available were sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and monoclonal antibodies directed against NAT and SSTR2. Sections were examined blinded to clinical information and scored for the percentage and intensity of tumour cells stained. These data were analysed in conjunction with clinical data.

Target expression scores varied widely between patients: NAT median 45%, inter-quartile range 25% - 65%; and SSTR2 median 55%, interquartile range 30% - 80%; and in some cases heterogeneity of expression between different parts of a tumour was observed.

Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). We demonstrated that disruption of motifs responsible for RNA recognition and binding not only prevents SG recruitment, but also dramatically increases the protein propensity to aggregate in the cell cytoplasm with formation of juxtanuclear structures displaying typical features of aggresomes. Functional RNA-binding domains from TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) fused to highly aggregation-prone C-terminally truncated FUS protein restored the ability to enter SGs and prevented aggregation of the chimeric protein. Truncated FUS was also able to trap endogenous FUS molecules in the cytoplasmic aggregates. Our data indicate that RNA binding and recruitment to SGs protect cytoplasmic FUS from aggregation, and loss of this protection may trigger its pathological aggregation in vivo.",

Importantly, this is not unique for MDR1, since other transcripts encoding transmembrane proteins, and which are thus translated at the endoplasmic reticulum, follow the same pattern. By using a series of chimaeric transcripts, we have demonstrated that transcript localization at the endoplasmic reticulum bypasses the signals dictating stress granule sequestration. Polysome profile analyses and protein synthesis experiments indicate that, upon stress withdrawal, endoplasmic-reticulum-bound transcripts resume translation faster than those at the cytosol, which have been sequestered into stress granules.

While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting efficiency varies from &lt;1% to &gt;95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability. Quantifying the RNA-seq analysis by smFISH reveals that only 10% of bulk mRNA molecules accumulate in mammalian stress granules and that only 185 genes have more than 50% of their mRNA molecules in stress granules.

Despite impressive treatment outcomes in a subset of patients who receive these immune therapies, many patients with NSCLC fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and the identification of a biomarker to select these patients remains highly sought after. In this review, we discuss the recent clinical trial results of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab for NSCLC, and the significance of companion diagnostic testing for tumor PD-L1 expression.",

Recently, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been proposed as a predictive biomarker for a better clinical outcome and pathological response (pR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in TNBC. These data confirm the role of the immune system in the neoplastic progression and in the response to therapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of 54 pre-NACT biopsies of TNBC and compared both the percentage of stromal TILs and the degree of PD-L1 expression with the extent of pR to standard NACT. A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 35% of cases. Univariate analysis showed (i) a significant association between PD-L1 expression in \u226525% of neoplastic cells and the achievement of a pCR (<i>p</i> = 0.024); (ii) a significantly higher frequency of pCR in cases showing \u226550% stromal TILs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27), suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to be confirmed by larger studies.",

Although the most studied biomarker is PD-L1 expression, its clinical significance is still debatable. In this article, we show the updated survival analysis of all published data. We searched in network and conference data sources for relevant clinical studies of immunotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer that assessed the PD-L1 expression even as an exploratory analysis. The updated survival hazard ratios (HR) were included in the analysis. 14 studies with 2857 patients were included (2019 treated with immunotherapy). The response rate was as higher among PD-L1-positive patients (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63-2.94). PD-L1 expression was also related to better progression-free survival (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85) and better overall survival (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.89). PD-L1 overexpression predicts activity as well as better survival for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881780": " The PD-1 receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 are known to be significantly involved in T-cell regulation. Recent studies suggest that PD-L1 expression in malignant tumors contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and disruption of antitumoral immune response. Drugs targeting this pathway are already tested in clinical trials against several tumor entities with promising results. However, until now comprehensive data with regard to PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still lacking. We assessed PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression via immunohistochemistry in two independent cohorts of 293 HNSCC patients. A significant subset of HNSCC showed high expression levels of PD-L1. Most remarkable, we detected a strong correlation between PD-L1 expression and overall survival time in both HNSCC cohorts. Further, in multivariate cox proportional hazard models, PD-L1 dominates as the strongest prognostic factor of patient's outcome in HNSCC, leaving even tumor stage and distant metastasis behind. Moreover, strong PD-L1 expression was associated with the presence of distant metastases in a subset of cases. In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker. In this respect, our results provide hints on further application of therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in HNSCC. Investigation of response and outcome of patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 containing therapies in correlation with PD-L1 expression analysis should be an important task for the future. In spite of improved treatment options and increasing knowledge of molecular alterations in HNSCC, the survival rate has not been dramatically changed in the past decades. Pies are missing in HNSCC. One promising candidate in cancer immune therapy is PD-L1. Drugs targeting PD-L1 or its receptor PD-1 are subject of several clinical studies in different cancer entities. However, comprehensive data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC and therefore a rational basis for anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy in HNSCC is lacking. Here, we provide wide-ranging data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC of all major localizations. We observed a strong correlation between expression of PD-L1 and reduced overall survival time. Furthermore, high PD-L1 expression was identified as a strong prognostic factor of patient's outcome when verified together with recognized prognostic factors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28837143": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare, heterogeneous and ubiquitous tumors commonly localized in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and pancreas. The clinical behavior of NEN is highly unpredictable; in fact, low-grade cases can unexpectedly be associated with metastases. Currently, the 2010 WHO NEN classification employs histological differentiation and the proliferation index for grading tumors but fails to provide reliable prognostic and therapeutic indications. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a better characterization of G2/G3 NENs. Similar to several other tumors, NENs possess immune-escape mechanisms, but very little has yet been done to characterize this crucial aspect. There are no available data describing PD-L1 expression in these tumors. Here we provide, for the first time, evidence of PD-L1 tissue expression in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with a high-grade WHO classification (G3) (P&lt;0.001) but not with gender, primary site, or lymph node status. The PD-L1 positivity rate and signal intensity are directly correlated (P&lt;0.001) with a grade increase from G1 to G3. In particular in G3 cases, we observed a dichotomy between the morphology (WD- and PD-NENs) and Ki67. Moreover, our study demonstrated a significant association with the grade and PD-L1 expression levels in immune-infiltrating cells (P&lt;0.001). In particular, G3 tumors are characterized by strong PD-L1 expression in both the tumor and infiltrating immune cells (P&lt;0.001), reflecting an unfavorable environment for T-cell-mediated tumor aggression. These findings suggest that NENs might acquire resistance to immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 and inhibiting peritumoral and intratumoral infiltrating lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Furthermore, pharmacological approaches using anti-PD-1 antibodies may become the logical choice for the treatment of G3 cases with a poor prognosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487198": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) upregulates the programmed cell death-1 receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) pathway, potentially compromising immunosurveillance. We compared circulating levels of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) in patients with cutaneous melanoma according to the presence and severity of OSA, and evaluated relationships with tumour aggressiveness and invasiveness.In a multicentre observational study, 360 patients with cutaneous melanoma underwent sleep studies, and serum sPD-L1 levels were assayed using ELISA. Cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness indices included mitotic rate, Breslow index, tumour ulceration, Clark level and tumour stage, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis was recorded as a marker of invasiveness.sPD-L1 levels were higher in severe OSA compared to mild OSA or non-OSA patients. In OSA patients, sPD-L1 levels correlated with Breslow index and were higher in patients with tumour ulceration, advanced primary tumour stages or with locoregional disease. The incorporation of sPD-L1 to the classic risk factors to SLN metastasis led to net improvements in the classification of 27.3%.Thus, sPD-L1 levels are increased in melanoma patients with severe OSA, and, in addition, might serve as a potential biomarker of cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness and invasiveness in this group of subjects.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30419350": "Gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma are aggressive cancers with a poor prognosis. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed, especially for patients refractory to conventional treatment. Cancer immunotherapy (CIT), is a promising new treatment option and is effective in a proportion of patients with gastroesophageal malignancies. Biomarkers for selecting patients likely to benefit from CIT in gastroesophageal malignancies remain unproven. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a validated biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is often also used to select patients for CIT in the context of gastroesophageal cancer, although this marker has not been validated for this purpose. We question the use of PD-L1 as a biomarker in gastroesophageal cancers, as there are fundamental differences in PD-L1 expression between NSCLC and gastroesophageal cancers. This review discusses the value of PD-L1 in selecting patients for CIT in esophageal and gastric cancer. Potential alternatives, especially microsatellite instability and Epstein-Barr virus positivity, are discussed.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30393621": "Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) has become a standard of care treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in first and later treatment lines with durable responses seen in approximately 10-20% of patients treated. However, the optimal selection of eligible patients who will benefit most, is far from being clear and the best biomarker has not yet been established. PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC. Most recently, two phase III first-line NSCLC studies have provided evidence that tumour mutational burden (TMB) correlates with the clinical response to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (CheckMate-227; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02477826\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02477826</a>), whereas atezolizumab response was correlated with T effector gene signature expression (IMPower 150; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02366143\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02366143</a>). Both studies demonstrated a significant primary endpoint [progression-free survival (PFS)] benefit in the TMB group and in the group of patients expressing a T effector cell signature, respectively. However, PFS benefit in both studies was seen regardless of the PD-L1 status of all patients suggesting that TMB and T effector cell signatures may be more robust to predict clinical response following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The role of putative novel predictive biomarkers evaluated in the CheckMate-227 and the IMPower 150 trials may, if confirmed in future prospective studies, offer a new perspective for predicting immunotherapy treatment outcomes of NSCLC patients in the near future.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567557": " Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death among males and the second leading cause among females globally. Checkpoint inhibitors re-engage the immune system to fight cancer. This review evaluates phase III data on the use of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and addresses PD-L1 expression in predicting efficacy. Six phase III clinical trials investigating checkpoint inhibitors for NSCLC were identified through a search of PubMed (to November 15, 2016) and conference databases, with findings updated from a directed search of eligible studies conducted in January 2018. Significant reductions in the risk of death ranging from 27% to 41% and were observed second-line and beyond. A relationship between PD-L1 expression and survival was apparent in most trials with optimal benefit for the highest expression levels (\u226550%). Benefit was also observed at low or no PD-L1 expression levels and in third-line in some studies. Significantly improved PFS was observed for pembrolizumab at high PD-L1 expression levels (\u226550%) first-line. Immune-related adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors are tolerable and rates of pneumonitis may be lower among PD-L1 inhibitors. Use of checkpoint inhibitors for tumors with driver mutations should only be considered after all appropriate targeted therapy and chemotherapy have been exhausted. PD-L1 testing presents a valuable tool to guide treatment sequencing and we recommend use of agent-specific PD-L1 tests and respective scoring systems until a standardized, convenient and broadly applicable test is identified. Checkpoint inhibitors represent a major advance in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 status can inform treatment decisions.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27801734": " Carcinosarcomas of the gynecologic tract, also known as malignant mixed M\u00fcllerian tumors, are aggressive neoplasms with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed, which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study. Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2), fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor. Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components. This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant value in a number of other malignant tumors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927720": " Although most primary cancers of the lung carry a heavy mutational load and will potentially present many \"nonself\" antigens to the immune system, there are a wide range of possible mechanisms for tumors to avoid so-called immune surveillance. One such mechanism is the adoption of immune checkpoints to inhibit the host immune response. Immune checkpoint inhibitors show great promise in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. To discuss the possibility of biomarker selection of patients for these therapies. This is becoming a much debated issue, and the immunohistochemical detection of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for the inhibitory Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1) checkpoint, is one possible biomarker. Data so far available show some conflicting results, but PD-L1 immunohistochemistry looks likely to be introduced into clinical use for selecting patients for treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapies. Given that there are 4 such drugs rapidly approaching regulatory approval, each with its own independent PD-L1 immunohistochemistry biomarker test, both oncologists and pathologists face some significant challenges. Peer-reviewed literature and meeting proceedings, especially during the last 12 months, were used. The biology of PD-1/PD-L1 is complex, the clinical data for these drugs show considerable variation, the selection performance of the PD-L1 biomarker test is not perfect, and the existence of 4 drug/test combinations adds significantly to the problems faced. This article addresses some of the background to this therapeutic problem and discusses some of the issues ahead."
