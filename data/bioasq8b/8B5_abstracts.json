Here, we present evidence that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) is increased and required during Th17 cell differentiation. Isolation of naive T cells from a murine model of lupus revealed increased levels of CaMK4 following stimulation with Th17-inducing cytokines but not following Treg, Th1, or Th2 induction. Furthermore, naive T cells from mice lacking CaMK4 did not produce IL-17. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of CaMK4 decreased the frequency of IL-17-producing T cells and ameliorated EAE and lupus-like disease in murine models. Inhibition of CaMK4 reduced Il17 transcription through decreased activation of the cAMP response element modulator \u03b1 (CREM-\u03b1) and reduced activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known to enhance Th17 differentiation. Importantly, silencing CaMK4 in T cells from patients with SLE and healthy individuals inhibited Th17 differentiation through reduction of IL17A and IL17F mRNA. Collectively, our results suggest that CaMK4 inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for Th17-driven autoimmune diseases.",

In this study, we demonstrated that crocin markedly induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) which leads to an anti-inflammatory response. Crocin inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production via downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B activity in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These effects were abrogated by blocking of HO-1 expression or activity. Crocin also induced Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular pools and phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 4 (CAMK4). CAMK4 knockdown and kinase-dead mutant inhibited crocin-mediated HO-1 expression, Nrf2 activation, and phosphorylation of Akt, indicating that HO-1 expression is mediated by CAMK4 and that Akt is a downstream mediator of CAMK4 in crocin signaling. Moreover, crocin-mediated suppression of iNOS expression was blocked by CAMK4 inhibition. Overall, these results suggest that crocin suppresses LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS by inducing HO-1 expression via Ca(2+)/calmodulin-CAMK4-PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 signaling cascades. Our findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for the inhibitory effects of crocin against endotoxin-mediated inflammation.",

Metabolomic profiling was performed using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry in naive T cells from MRL/lpr mice treated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies in the absence or presence of a CaMK4 inhibitor (KN-93). The expression of GLUT1 and CaMK4 in CD4+ T cells from healthy controls (n = 16), patients with inactive SLE (n = 13), and patients with active SLE (n = 14) was examined by flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In vitro experiments were performed to determine the effect of KN-93 on the expression of GLUT1 during Th17 cell differentiation in T cells from patients with SLE. CaMK4 inhibition significantly decreased the levels of glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pyruvate, and lactate (P &lt; 0.05), whereas it did not affect the levels of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates such as 6-phospho-d-gluconate, ribulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The expression levels of GLUT1 and CaMK4 in effector memory CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in patients with active SLE compared to healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively) and patients with inactive SLE (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). A functional analysis revealed that CaMK4 inhibition decreased the expression of GLUT1 during Th17 cell differentiation (P &lt; 0.01), followed by a reduction of interleukin-17 (IL-17) production (P &lt; 0.05). The results of the study indicate that the activity of CaMK4 could be responsible for glycolysis, which contributes to the production of IL-17, and CaMK4 may contribute to aberrant expression of GLUT1 in T cells from patients with active SLE.",

These include Roberts syndrome (RBS), Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities, limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells, which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise. Developmental Dynamics 246:881-888, 2017. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, no consensus has been reached regarding treatment following progression after first-line therapy. Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) is a humanised anti-programmed death-1 (anti PD-1) antibody. We present safety and preliminary antitumour activity of camrelizumab alone as second-line therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line therapy in this patient population. We report the results from two single-arm, phase 1 trials. Both trials included patients aged 18-70 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and confirmed metastatic disease or locoreginal recurrence, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients who received at least one previous line of treatment were enrolled at five academic hospitals in China into the dose-escalation and expansion trial to receive camrelizumab monotherapy intravenously at escalating doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, and a bridging dose of 200 mg per dose once every 2 weeks (monotherapy trial). Treatment-naive patients were enrolled from a single centre in China to receive six cycles of camrelizumab 200 mg (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> (days 1 and 8), and cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1) every 3 weeks followed by camrelizumab 200 mg maintenance once every 3 weeks (combination trial). The primary endpoint of both trials was the safety and tolerability of the study treatment. Analyses were done per protocol. Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02721589\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02721589</a> (camrelizumab monotherapy trial) and <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03121716\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT03121716</a> (camrelizumab combination trial). Both trials are ongoing, but are no longer enrolling patients. In the camrelizumab monotherapy trial, between March 31, 2016, and Sept 20, 2017, 121 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 93 patients were enrolled across the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts and received at least one dose of camrelizumab (safety population). 15 (16%) of 93 patients had treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4, the most common of which were elevated conjugated bilirubin concentration (three [3%] of 93 patients), stomatitis, anaemia, and increased concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin, each of which occurred in two (2%) patients. Eight (9%) patients had a treatment-related serious adverse event. No dose-limiting toxic effects were observed during the dose-escalation phase. 31 (34%; 95% CI 24-44) of 91 evaluable patients on camrelizumab monotherapy had an overall response with a median follow-up of 9\u00b79 months (IQR 8\u00b71-11\u00b77). In the camrelizumab combination trial, between April 18, 2017, and Aug 15, 2017, 24 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 23 patients were enrolled and treated (safety population). 20 (87%) of 23 patients had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events: neutropenia (13 [57%] of 23 patients), anaemia (11 [48%] patients), leucopenia (11 [48%] patients), thrombocytopenia (seven [30%] patients), oedema (two [9%] patients), hyponatraemia (two [9%] patients), hypochloraemia (one [4%] patients), and rash (one [4%] patient). Two patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred in these trials. 20 (91% [95% CI 72-97]) of 22 evaluable patients had an overall response with a median follow-up time of 10\u00b72 months (IQR 9\u00b77-10\u00b78). Camrelizumab is a well tolerated, potential treatment option for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The combination of camrelizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin has a manageable toxicity profile and promising preliminary antitumour activity for this disease in treatment-naive patients.

As decitabine is known to boost T-cell function, we assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 camrelizumab alone versus decitabine-primed camrelizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. This two-arm, open-label, phase II study enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who had received at least two lines of previous therapy. Anti-PD-1 treatment-na\u00efve patients were randomly assigned (1:2) to camrelizumab (200 mg) monotherapy or decitabine (10 mg/d, days 1 to 5) plus camrelizumab (200 mg, day 8) combination therapy every 3 weeks. Patients who were previously treated with anti-PD-1 were assigned combination therapy. Primary end point was CR rate and safety. Overall, 86 patients were enrolled and evaluated for response, with a median follow-up of 14.9 months. In anti-PD-1-na\u00efve patients, CR rate was 32% (six of 19 patients) with camrelizumab monotherapy versus 71% (30 of 42 patients) who were administered decitabine plus camrelizumab (<i>P</i> = .003). At the time of analysis, the response duration rate at 6 months was 76% on camrelizumab monotherapy versus 100% on decitabine plus camrelizumab. For patients who were previously treated with anti-PD-1, 28% achieved CR and 24% partial response after decitabine plus camrelizumab. Ten patients maintained a response at more than 6 months and 81% of responders were estimated to have a response at more than 1 year. For both treatments, the most common adverse events were clinically inconsequential cherry hemangiomas and leukocytopenia that were self-limiting. CR rate in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were clinically na\u00efve to PD-1 blockade was significantly higher with decitabine plus camrelizumab than with camrelizumab alone.

We aimed to comprehensively compare the efficacy and safety of different anti-PD-1 drugs, standard chemotherapy, and their combination therapy in RM-NPC. Adverse event (AE) and objective response rate (ORR) were assessed. The pooled incidence rates of grade 1-5/3-5 AEs were 74.1%/29.6, 54.2%/17.4, 92.3%/24.5, 96.8%/16.1, 91.2%/42.8, and 100%/87.9% for pembrolizumab, nivolumab, JS001, camrelizumab, chemotherapy and camrelizumab+chemotherapy, respectively, which suggested that nivolumab and pembrolizumab exhibited the optimal safety regarding grade 1-5 AEs whereas camrelizumab and nivolumab regarding grade 3-5 AEs. As second- or later-line therapy, ORR was higher with camrelizumab (34.1%), followed by pembrolizumab (26.3%), JS001 (23.3%), and nivolumab (19.0%); whereas ORR with first-line nivolumab reached 40%. Additionally, first-line camrelizumab+chemotherapy achieved a dramatically higher ORR than that with chemotherapy alone (90.9% vs. 64.1%). Pooled ORR was 28.4 and 17.4% for PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients, respectively (P = 0.11). Here, we represent preliminary evidence for the comparative safety and efficacy of existing anti-PD-1 agents with/without chemotherapy in RM-NPC, which indicated that camrelizumab has the least toxicity profile and merits future investigation.

All patients were administered intravenous camrelizumab (SHR-1210), a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, at doses of 60 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg (4-week interval after first dose followed by a 2-week schedule) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Associations between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and other peripheral blood biomarkers at baseline and the efficacy of camrelizumab were also investigated. After median follow-up of 19.6 months, the overall response rate was 25.6% (11/43), including one complete response. Median progression-free and overall survival rates were 2.0 and 8.0 months, respectively. Patients with an elevated baseline LDH had lower tumor response rates (P = 0.02) and shorter progression-free (P = 0.002) and overall (P &lt; 0.0001) survival than patients with normal LDH levels. An increase in LDH levels during treatment was significantly associated with disease progression. Multivariate Cox analysis identified LDH (hazard ratio [HR] 0.18), CRP (HR 0.27), the number of organs involved (HR 0.31), absolute monocyte count (HR 0.33), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (HR 0.36) as independent prognostic factors.

Although the major symptom of this disorder is photosensitivity, rarely, it can cause progressive liver disease requiring liver transplantation (LT). However, LT is not curative and only bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can correct the underlying enzymatic defect. Because liver disease results from accumulation of protoporphyrin in the liver, LT without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation leaves the new liver at risk for similar EPP-related damage. A handful of pediatric patients undergoing sequential LT and stem cell transplantation have been described in the literature; however, to date none has been described in detail in adults.

It is an orally active metalloprotease inhibitor of the same class as batimastat, and is the first compound in this class to have completed a pivotal clinical trial. Marimastat also has collagenase- and angiogenesis-inhibiting properties. British Biotech and Schering-Plough have signed an agreement enabling the latter to develop and market marimastat in North America and Europe. Under the terms of the agreement, British Biotech will receive an up-front license fee of 4 million US dollars and a 4 million US dollars equity investment in British Biotech by Schering-Plough. Schering-Plough holds rights to marimastat in all countries other than the Far East and Japan. The two companies are considering asking the FDA for accelerated approval in gastric cancer based on the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival. Marimastat is licensed to Tanabe Seiyaku in Japan, where phase II clinical trials are underway for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and lung cancer. Further phase II trials in other tumour types are planned. The commencement of phase II trials in Japan resulted in a milestone payment of 5 million US dollars to British Biotech from Tanabe Seiyaku. Tanabe Seiyaku also holds rights to marimastat in the Far East. Marimastat has been in pivotal phase III trials in glioblastoma, breast, ovarian and small and non-small cell lung cancer, but these trials have all been discontinued because marimastat failed to show superior efficacy over either standard chemotherapy or placebo. Results from the marimastat 131 trial in patients with glioblastoma, for example, indicated that marimastat was no better than placebo at prolonging survival in these cancer patients. In June 2000, when the results of this study were released, shares in British Biotech fell 21.6% to just 19 pence per share. The phase III trial in small cell lung cancer was discontinued when the results of study 140 were released in February 2001 showing that marimastat was not significantly more effective than placebo in prolonging the survival of small cell lung cancer patients. The results of this study were consistent with those reported in study 117. British Biotech has also conducted a phase III placebo-controlled study of marimastat as monotherapy in patients with inoperable gastric cancer at 37 centres throughout Europe. Results from this trial indicated that it did not achieve its primary endpoint of a statistically significant survival benefit over placebo. However, data collected during the follow-up period have shown increases in survival benefit in the treatment group in addition to a significant improvement in disease-free progression, the secondary endpoint of the trial. Development of marimastat for this indication is ongoing. In May 2001, British Biotech reported data from an interim analysis of results from the remaining phase III study in pancreatic cancer (study 183) that showed no patient benefit for marimastat recipients compared with gemcitabine. However, these results did not meet stopping criteria and the study continues under the guidance of Schering-Plough. The multicentre trials are being conducted in the US, Canada and the European Union. The phase III trial of marimastat in combination with carboplatin that was being conducted in patients with ovarian cancer was discontinued because British Biotech realised that the design of the trial was insufficient for registration in the US or Europe. Altogether, seven phase III studies have failed to meet their primary end-points, but the company has stated that the effectiveness of marimastat is more likely to be seen in patients with less advanced disease.

Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) have been shown to inhibit tumor growth and dissemination in preclinical models. Not all lung cancers express the MMPs believed to be most important in promoting the neoplastic process, and there are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic significance of MMPs in lung cancer. However, it is possible that these observations are because of limitations in the procedures for measuring MMPs. Many investigators believe that MMPs are universally involved in tumor progression; this hypothesis was the basis for initiating seven phase III MMPI trials in lung cancer. Four studies were closed at completion of the predefined accrual goal, and three were closed early. There were no significant differences in survival in a non-small cell lung cancer prinomastat study, and in a small cell lung cancer marimastat trial.

This finding is provocative because the soluble receptors have the capacity to act as antagonists. Several other inflammatory disorders are also associated with increased production of soluble TNF alpha receptors suggesting that this may be a general compensatory mechanism designed to down-regulate inflammation. The recent identification of an SLE disease susceptibility locus near the TNFR2 locus (TNFR p75) suggested the hypothesis that genetically driven differences in soluble TNFR2 production could play a role in the genetic susceptibility to SLE. We therefore characterized the frequency of a genetic polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFR2 gene in Caucasoid SLE patients and geographically matched controls. No difference in the gene frequency of the two base-pair polymorphism in SLE patients compared to controls was found, nor was there any association with any particular clinical phenotype.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze the polymorphism of TNFR2 and its possible association with the susceptibility to SLE, using the case-control association analysis. Polymorphism screening of the exons containing previously reported nonsynonymous base substitutions was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method, using genomic DNA from 81 Japanese patients with SLE and 207 healthy individuals. Two alleles were present in exon 6, coding for methionine (196M) and arginine (196R) at position 196. 30 of 81 patients (37.0%) with SLE were positive for the 196R allele, which was significantly more frequent compared with 39 of 207 healthy individuals (18.8%) (chi2=10.6, df=l, P=0.001, odds ratio=2.53, 95% CI: 1.45-4.43). Genotype analysis revealed that the presence of one 196R allele was sufficient for rendering susceptibility. The association of 196R allele with SLE was independent from that of HLA-DRB1*1501. In conclusion, the TNFR2 196R allele was found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE in the Japanese population.

Significant transmission was observed for HLA-DRB1*1501, but not for HLA-DRB1*0301, nor for TNF haplotype that codes for -308A. Interestingly, TNF haplotype coding for -1031C, -863A, -857C showed a tendency of preferential nontransmission in the patients without lupus nephritis and in those with malar rash. No transmission distortion was observed for TNFR2-196R allele. These findings confirmed the association of HLA-DRB1*1501, but did not replicate that of the HLA-DRB1*0301, TNFA-308A and TNFR2-196R with SLE in this population. In addition, a possible disease-protective role for TNF haplotype coding for -1031C, -863A, -857C was suggested.",

While 3R tau is found in Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD), 4R tau is more abundant in corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and AD. We have previously shown that Cerebrolysin\u2122 (CBL), a neuropeptide mixture with neurotrophic effects, ameliorates the pathology in amyloid precursor protein transgenic (tg) mouse model of AD and 4R tau, however it is unclear if CBL ameliorates the deficits and neuropathology in the mouse model of Pick's disease over expressing 3R tau. Mice expressing 3R tau (L266V and G272V mutations) under the mThy-1 promoter were treated with CBL in two separate groups, the first was 3 months old (treated for 3 months, IP) and the second was 6 months old (treated for 3 months, IP) at the start of the treatment. We found that although the levels of total 3R tau were unchanged, CBL reduced the levels of hyper-phosphorylated tau in both groups of mice. This was accompanied by reduced neurodegenerative pathology in the neocortex and hippocampus in both groups and by improvements in the behavioral deficits in the nest-building test and water maze in the 3-6 month group. Taken together these results support the notion that CBL may be beneficial in other taupathy models by reducing the levels of aberrantly phosphorylated tau.",

Histologically, CTE is defined as a tauopathy with a distribution of tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that is distinct from other tauopathies, and usually shows an absence of beta-amyloid deposits, in contrast to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the connection between repeated concussions and CTE-type neurodegeneration has been recently proposed, this causal relationship has not yet been firmly established. Also, the prevalence of CTE among athletes with multiple concussions is unknown. We performed a consecutive case series brain autopsy study on six retired professional football players from the Canadian Football League (CFL) with histories of multiple concussions and significant neurological decline. All participants had progressive neurocognitive decline prior to death; however, only 3 cases had post-mortem neuropathological findings consistent with CTE. The other 3 participants had pathological diagnoses of AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the CTE cases showed co-morbid pathology of cancer, vascular disease, and AD. Our case studies highlight that not all athletes with history of repeated concussions and neurological symptomology present neuropathological changes of CTE. These preliminary findings support the need for further research into the link between concussion and CTE as well as the need to expand the research to other possible causes of taupathy in athletes. They point to a critical need for prospective studies with good sampling methods to allow us to understand the relationship between multiple concussions and the development of CTE.",

We investigated whether inhibition of the highly homologous insulin receptor (IR) in addition to the IGF1R would be more effective than inhibition of the IGF1R alone at preventing the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Signalling through IGF1R and IR in the NSCLC cell lines A549 and Hcc193 was stimulated by a combination of IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. It was inhibited by antibodies that block ligand binding, \u03b1IR3 (IGF1R) and IR47-9 (IR), and by the ATP-competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 which inhibit both IGF1R and IR tyrosine kinases. The effect of inhibitors was determined by an anchorage-independent proliferation assay and by analysis of Akt phosphorylation. In Hcc193 cells the reduction in cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation due to anti-IGF1R antibody was enhanced by antibody-mediated inhibition of the IR whereas in A549 cells, with a relatively low IR:IGF1R expression ratio, it was not. In each cell line proliferation and Akt phosphorylation were more effectively inhibited by AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 than by combined \u03b1IR3 and IR47-9. When the IGF1R alone is inhibited, unencumbered signalling through the IR can contribute to continued NSCLC cell proliferation. We conclude that small molecule inhibitors targeting both the IR and IGF1R more effectively reduce NSCLC cell proliferation in a manner independent of the IR:IGF1R expression ratio, providing a therapeutic rationale for the treatment of this disease.",

Recently, resources such as the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 database provide gene expression profiles induced by various chemical and genetic perturbations and thereby make it possible to analyze the relationship between compounds and gene targets at a genome-wide scale. Current approaches for comparing the expression profiles are based on pairwise connectivity mapping analysis. However, this method makes the simple assumption that the effect of a drug treatment is similar to knocking down its single target gene. Since many compounds can bind multiple targets, the pairwise mapping ignores the combined effects of multiple targets, and therefore fails to detect many potential targets of the compounds. We propose an algorithm to find sets of gene knock-downs that induce gene expression changes similar to a drug treatment. Assuming that the effects of gene knock-downs are additive, we propose a novel bipartite block-wise sparse multi-task learning model with super-graph structure (BBSS-MTL) for multi-target drug repositioning that overcomes the restrictive assumptions of connectivity mapping analysis.

However, an overzealous production, leading up to a cytokine storm, can be deleterious and contributes to mortality consecutive to sepsis or toxic shock syndrome. Endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) are particularly inflammatory because they generate auto-amplificatory loops after activation of monocytes/macrophages. LPS and numerous pore-forming exotoxins also activate the inflammasome, the molecular platform that allows the release of mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18.

Now we describe a novel event where virus-specific T cells induce a cytokine storm. The paramyxovirus pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is a model of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). Unexpectedly, when C57BL/6 mice were infected with PVM, the innate inflammatory response was undetectable until day 5 postinfection, at which time CD8(+) T cells infiltrated into the lung, initiating a cytokine storm by their production of gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Administration of an immunomodulatory sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1R) agonist significantly inhibited PVM-elicited cytokine storm by blunting the PVM-specific CD8(+) T cell response, resulting in diminished pulmonary disease and enhanced survival. A dysregulated overly exuberant immune response, termed a \"cytokine storm,\" accompanies virus-induced acute respiratory diseases (VARV), is primarily responsible for the accompanying high morbidity and mortality, and can be controlled therapeutically in influenza virus infection of mice and ferrets by administration of sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor (S1P1R) agonists.

The database essentially consists of a collection of text files providing specific annotations for human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely whether they are predicted to abolish, create or change the affinity of one or several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. A SNP's effect on TF binding is estimated based on a position weight matrix (PWM) model for the binding specificity of the corresponding factor. These data files are regenerated at regular intervals by an automatic procedure that takes as input a reference genome, a comprehensive SNP catalogue and a collection of PWMs. SNP2TFBS is also accessible over a web interface, enabling users to view the information provided for an individual SNP, to extract SNPs based on various search criteria, to annotate uploaded sets of SNPs or to display statistics about the frequencies of binding sites affected by selected SNPs.

Peanut allergies are also on the rise and often do not spontaneously resolve, leaving individuals at-risk for potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis throughout their lifetime. Currently, two forms of peanut immunotherapy, oral immunotherapy (OIT) and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT), are in Phase III clinical trials and have shown promise to induce desensitization in many subjects. However, there are several limitations with OIT and EPIT, such as allergic side effects, daily dosing requirements, and the infrequent outcome of long-term tolerance. Next-generation therapies for peanut allergy should aim to overcome these limitations, which may be achievable with adjuvanted immunotherapy. An adjuvant can be defined as anything that enhances, accelerates, or modifies an immune response to a particular antigen. Adjuvants may allow for lower doses of antigen to be given leading to decreased side effects; may only need to be administered every few weeks or months rather than daily exposures; and may induce a long-lasting protective effect.

Up to 10% of FCoV infections, however, result in the fatal disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Clinical challenges: Obtaining a definitive diagnosis of FIP based on non-invasive approaches is difficult. Confirmation of the disease relies on finding appropriate cytological or histopathological changes in association with positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen. In FIP cases with effusions, cytology and immunostaining on effusion samples can be relatively easy to perform; otherwise obtaining diagnostic samples is more challenging and collection of biopsies from tissues with gross lesions is necessary. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, a high index of suspicion of FIP may be obtained from the cat's signalment and history, combined with findings on clinical examination and laboratory test results. If largely consistent with FIP, these can be used as a basis for discussion with the owner about whether additional, more invasive, diagnostic tests are warranted. In some cases it may be that euthanasia is discussed as an alternative to pursuing a definitive diagnosis ante-mortem, especially if financial limitations exist or where there are concerns over a cat's ability to tolerate invasive diagnostic procedures. Ideally, the diagnosis should be confirmed in such patients from samples taken at post-mortem examination.

Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, resulting in a lethal systemic granulomatous disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is one of the most important fatal infectious diseases of cats worldwide. No specific vaccines or drugs have been approved to treat FIP. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s) play a pivotal role in viral transcription and replication, making them an ideal target for drug development. Here, we report the crystal structure of FIPV M(pro) in complex with dual inhibitors, a zinc ion and a Michael acceptor. The complex structure elaborates a unique mechanism of two distinct inhibitors synergizing to inactivate the protease, providing a structural basis to design novel antivirals and suggesting the potential to take advantage of zinc as an adjunct therapy against CoV-associated diseases. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest genome size among all RNA viruses. CoV infection causes various diseases in humans and animals, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). No approved specific drugs or vaccinations are available to treat their infections.

We demonstrated that zinc ion and a Michael acceptor-based peptidomimetic inhibitor synergistically inactivate FIPV M(pro). We also solved the structure of FIPV M(pro) complexed with two inhibitors, delineating the structural view of a dual inhibition mechanism.

The causative agent of this deadly disease, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), arises from feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). The review summarizes our current knowledge of the genome and proteome of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), focusing on the viral surface (spike) protein S and the five accessory proteins. We also review the current classification of FCoVs into distinct serotypes and biotypes, cellular receptors of FCoVs and their presumed role in viral virulence, and discuss other aspects of FIPV-induced pathogenesis. Our current knowledge of genetic differences between FECVs and FIPVs has been mainly based on comparative sequence analyses that revealed \"discriminatory\" mutations that are present in FIPVs but not in FECVs. Most of these mutations result in amino acid substitutions in the S protein and these may have a critical role in the switch from FECV to FIPV. In most cases, the precise roles of these mutations in the molecular pathogenesis of FIP have not been tested experimentally in the natural host, mainly due to the lack of suitable experimental tools including genetically engineered virus mutants.

The virus that causes FIP (FIPV) is believed to occur sporadically and spread infrequently from cat to cat. Recently, an FIP outbreak from an animal shelter was confirmed in Taiwan. FCoV from all the cats in this shelter were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of this outbreak. Thirteen of 46 (28.2%) cats with typical signs of FIP were identified. Among them, seven cats were confirmed by necropsy and/or histopathological examinations. Despite the fact that more than one FCoV was identified in this multi-cat environment, the eight FIP cats were invariably found to be infected with a type II FCoV. Sequence analysis revealed that the type II FIPV detected from fecal samples, body effusions and granulomatous tissue homogenates from the cats that succumbed to FIP all harbored an identical recombination site in their S gene. Two of the cats that succumbed to FIP were found to harbor an identical nonsense mutation in the 3c gene. Fecal shedding of this type II virus in the effusive form of FIP can be detected up to six days before death.

HMA treatment drastically decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2 in a dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146. In contrast, DIDS treatment decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. We investigated whether there is a difference in ion channel activity of the E protein between viral serotypes using E. coli cells expressing the E protein of FIPV serotypes I and II. No difference was observed, suggesting that a viroporin other than the E protein influences the differences in the actions of HMA and DIDS on FIPV serotypes I and II.",

Tissue culture-adapted type I FCoV shows reduced FIP induction in experimental infections, which complicates the understanding of FIP pathogenesis caused by type I FCoV. We previously found that the type I FCoV strain C3663 efficiently induces FIP in specific-pathogen-free cats through the naturally infectious route. In this study, we employed a bacterial artificial chromosome-based reverse genetics system to gain more insights into FIP caused by the C3633 strain. We successfully generated recombinant virus (rC3663) from Fcwf-4 cells transfected with infectious cDNA that showed growth kinetics similar to those shown by the parental virus. Next, we constructed a reporter C3663 virus carrying the nanoluciferase (Nluc) gene to measure viral replication with high sensitivity. The inhibitory effects of different compounds against rC3663-Nluc could be measured within 24 h postinfection. Furthermore, we found that A72 cells derived from canine fibroblasts permitted FCoV replication without apparent cytopathic effects. Thus, our reporter virus is useful for uncovering the infectivity of type I FCoV in different cell lines, including canine-derived cells. Surprisingly, we uncovered aberrant viral RNA transcription of rC3663 in A72 cells. Overall, we succeeded in obtaining infectious cDNA clones derived from type I FCoV that retained its virulence.

However, in some cases high doses of GCs are required to achieve remission (i.e. glucocorticoid-resistance), leading to significant side effects. A 28-year-old Romani male was admitted to our hospital for polyarthralgia, polyserositis and fatigability. The patient had high-grade fever, jaundice and generalized lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests revealed severe mixed hemolytic autoimmune anemia, leukopenia, hepatocytolysis, coagulation abnormalities, hypertriglyceridemia, biological inflammatory syndrome, hyperferritinemia and persistent proteinuria of nephritic pattern. Imaging studies showed pleuropericardial effusion, hepatosplenomegaly and polysynovitis. Additional blood tests revealed hypocomplementemia and positive ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies. Haemophagocytosis was not identified either on bone marrow or axillary lymph node biopsy specimens. However, SLE-associated MAS seemed to fit this set-up.

Although treatment with antioxidative nanoparticles alone did not eliminate bacteria, combined treatment with an antibacterial agent was found to significantly improve survival rate of the treated mice as compared to the control group.

We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment. However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre- to postfusion conformational transition.",

Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27082314": "In response to infectious and, in some instances, noninfectious insults, the affected tissues/cells of the host undergo inflammation. However, uncontrolled inflammation could be detrimental to the host, resulting in inflammatory disease, such as inflammatory lung disease. Although the etiology of the disease is well defined, the underling pathogenesis is still incompletely understood. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), one of the primary cardiovascular regulatory systems, has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease. In particular, the RAS has been implicated as advances in the understanding of the multifunctionality of individual components of the system have been made, and by the fact that the RAS acts not only systemically, but also locally in a variety of tissues, including the lung. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a relatively new member of the RAS, has drawn extensive attention since 2003, because of the findings that ACE2 is the receptor for SARS Corona virus and that maintenance of normal ACE2 levels in the lung is beneficial for the host to combat inflammatory lung disease. Nevertheless, the mechanism through which ACE2 plays a role in inflammatory lung disease has not been clearly identified. In an attempt to summarize current literature findings and progress made in uncovering the role of ACE2 in inflammatory lung disease, this review will focus on recent studies examining pulmonary ACE2 biology, its roles in inflammatory lung disease pathogenesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Finally, we will discuss pulmonary ACE2 as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory lung disease.",

The infection of target cells by the SARS CoV is mediated through the interaction of the viral Spike (S) protein (1255 amino acids) and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (amino acids N318-T509 of S protein) harbors an extended excursion along its periphery that contacts ACE2 and is designated the receptor-binding motif (RBM, amino acids S432-T486). In addition, the RBM is a major antigenic determinant, able to elicit production of neutralizing antibodies. Hence, the role of the RBM is a bi-functional bioactive surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody (mAb) 80R which targets the RBM and competes with the ACE2 receptor for binding. Here, we employ phage-display peptide-libraries to reconstitute a functional RBM. This is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate RBM peptides that present a diversity of conformations. Screening such 'Conformer Libraries' with corresponding ligands has produced short RBM constructs (ca. 40 amino acids) that can bind both the ACE2 receptor and the neutralizing mAb 80R.",

Since many virological and immunological data on FECV infections are lacking, the present study investigated these missing links during experimental infection of three SPF cats with FECV strain UCD. Two cats showed mild clinical signs, faecal shedding of infectious virus from 4 dpi, a cell-associated viraemia at inconsistent time points from 5 dpi, a highly neutralising antibody response from 9 dpi, and no major abnormalities in leukocyte numbers. Faecal shedding lasted for 28-56 days, but virus shed during this stage was less infectious in enterocyte cultures and affected by mutations. Remarkably, in the other cat neither clinical signs nor acute shedding were seen, but virus was detected in blood cells from 3 dpi, and shedding of non-enterotropic, mutated viruses suddenly occurred from 14 dpi onwards. Neutralising antibodies arose from 21 dpi. Leukocyte numbers were not different compared to the other cats, except for the CD8(+) regulatory T cells. These data indicate that FECV can infect immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication and raise the hypothesis that the gradual adaptation to these cells can allow non-enterotropic mutants to arise.",

RT-qPCR results showed that the circular TFO RNAs, except TFO2, inhibit FIPV replication, where the viral genome copy numbers decreased significantly by 5-fold log10 from 10(14) in the virus-inoculated cells to 10(9) in the circular TFO RNAs-transfected cells. Furthermore, the binding of the circular TFO RNA with the targeted viral genome segment was also confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The strength of binding kinetics between the TFO RNAs and their target regions was demonstrated by NanoITC assay.

However, a recent study found that one-third of FIPV isolates have an intact 3c and suggested that it is not solely involved in FIP but is essential for intestinal replication. In order to confirm these assumptions, 27 fecal and 32 FIP coronavirus isolates were obtained from resident or adopted cats from a large metropolitan shelter during 2008-2009 and their 3a-c, E, and M genes sequenced. Forty percent of coronavirus isolates from FIP tissues had an intact 3c gene, while 60% had mutations that truncated the gene product. The 3c genes of fecal isolates from healthy cats were always intact. Coronavirus from FIP diseased tissues consistently induced FIP when given either oronasally or intraperitoneally (i.p.), regardless of the functional status of their 3c genes, thus confirming them to be FIPVs. In contrast, fecal isolates from healthy cats were infectious following oronasal infection and shed at high levels in feces without causing disease, as expected for FECVs. Only one in three cats shed FECV in the feces following i.p. infection, indicating that FECVs can replicate systemically, but with difficulty. FIPVs having a mutated 3c were not shed in the feces following either oronasal or i.p. inoculation, while FIPVs with intact 3c genes were shed in the feces following oronasal but not i.p. inoculation. Therefore, an intact 3c appears to be essential for intestinal replication. Although FIPVs with an intact 3c were shed in the feces following oronasal inoculation, fecal virus from these cats was not infectious for other cats. Attempts to identify potential FIP mutations in the 3a, 3b, E, and M were negative. However, the 3c gene of FIPVs, even though appearing intact, contained many more non-synonymous amino acid changes in the 3' one-third of the 3c protein than FECVs. An attempt to trace FIPV isolates back to enteric strains existing in the shelter was only partially successful due to the large region over which shelter cats and kittens originated, housing conditions prior to acquisition, and rapid movement through the shelter. No evidence could be found to support a recent theory that FIPVs and FECVs are genetically distinct.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27027316": "Coronaviruses infect animals and humans causing a wide range of diseases. The diversity of coronaviruses in many mammalian species is contributed by relatively high mutation and recombination rates during replication. This dynamic nature of coronaviruses may facilitate cross-species transmission and shifts in tissue or cell tropism in a host, resulting in substantial change in virulence. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes inapparent or mild enteritis in cats, but a highly fatal disease, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), can arise through mutation of FECV to FIP virus (FIPV). The pathogenesis of FIP is intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of T cells, features shared by some other coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. The increasing risks of highly virulent coronavirus infections in humans or animals call for effective antiviral drugs, but no such measures are yet available. Previously, we have reported the inhibitors that target 3C-like protease (3CLpro) with broad-spectrum activity against important human and animal coronaviruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our 3CLpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP. Experimental FIP is 100% fatal once certain clinical and laboratory signs become apparent. We found that antiviral treatment led to full recovery of cats when treatment was started at a stage of disease that would be otherwise fatal if left untreated. Antiviral treatment was associated with a rapid improvement in fever, ascites, lymphopenia and gross signs of illness and cats returned to normal health within 20 days or less of treatment. Significant reduction in viral titers was also observed in cats. These results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease of FIP. These findings may provide important insights into devising therapeutic strategies and selection of antiviral compounds for further development for important coronaviruses in animals and humans.",

Our findings suggest that functional 3c protein expression is crucial for FECV replication in the gut, but dispensable for systemic FIPV replication. Whilst intact in all FECVs, the 3c gene was mutated in the majority (71.4 %) of FIPVs, but not in all, implying that mutation in 3c is not the (single) cause of FIP. Most cats with FIP had no detectable intestinal feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and had seemingly cleared the primary FECV infection. In those with detectable intestinal FCoV, the virus always had an intact 3c and seemed to have been acquired by FECV superinfection. Apparently, 3c-inactivated viruses replicate not at all--or only poorly--in the gut, explaining the rare incidence of FIP outbreaks.",

Natural initial enteric FCoV infection may remain subclinical, or result in mild enteric signs or the development of FIP; cats may also carry the virus systemically with no adverse effect. This study screened mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), the presumed first site of FCoV spread from the intestine regardless of viraemia, for changes in the transcription of a panel of innate immune response mediators in response to systemic FCoV infection and with FIP, aiming to identify key pathways triggered by FCoV. Cats with and without FIP, the latter with and without FCoV infection in the MLN, were compared. Higher expression levels in FIP were found for toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4 and 8. These are part of the first line of defence and suggest a response to both viral structural proteins and viral nucleic acid. Expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-15, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, CXCL10, CCL8, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, was higher in cats with FIP, consistent with inflammatory pathway activation. Expression of genes encoding transcription factors STAT1 and 2, regulating signalling pathways, particularly of the interferons, was also higher. Among cats without FIP, there were few differences between virus-positive and virus-negative MLNs; however, TLR9 and STAT2 expression were higher with infection, suggesting a direct viral effect. The study provides evidence for TLR involvement in the response to FCoV. This could open up new avenues for therapeutic approaches.",

In this study, long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen- and human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT)-induced immortalization. Subsequently, these cultures were evaluated for their usability in FCoV research. Firstly, the replication capacity of the serotype II strains WSU 79-1683 and WSU 79-1146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures. In accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures, FCoV WSU 79-1683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to FCoV WSU 79-1146 in both continuous cultures. In addition, the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from FIP cats. The cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype I enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated. No infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. In conclusion, a new reliable model for FCoV investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established.

In the present study we investigated its expression in the T lymphoid lineage. In adults, a high level of expression was detected in CD4-CD8- thymocytes. Most remarkably, the peak of Xlr expression occurred early during thymus cell ontogeny, precisely on days 14-15 of gestation, and was associated with the first wave of pre-T cell differentiation. Its onset preceded the rearrangement of TCR genes, as Xlr expression was conserved in thymus cells from RAG1(0/0) mice. The lower expression of Xlr on day 13 of fetal development, the bright Thy1+ phenotype of Xlr-positive cells, their large size, and their absence from subcapsular areas suggest that Xlr expression must be turned on within the thymus and not in prethymic precursors. From day 16 of gestation, Xlr expression decreased markedly. At birth and later, Xlr(high) cells were mostly large cells scattered throughout the cortical area. As shown by confocal microscopy, expression of Xlr closely overlapped that of SATB1, which binds special AT-rich DNA sequences associated with the nuclear matrix and plays an important regulatory role for many genes. The remarkably regulated expression of Xlr in the lymphoid cell lineage and of its homologue Xmr in the germ cell lineage suggests that they might play an important role in chromatin metabolism at critical stages of differentiation during which the genome undergoes irreversible rearrangements.",

However, the mechanistic basis for ASE activity is unknown. Here, we show that the ASE physically interacts with the distant Rag1 and Rag2 gene promoters in DP thymocytes, bringing the two promoters together to form an active chromatin hub. Moreover, we show that the ASE functions as a classical enhancer that can potently activate these promoters in the absence of the silencer or other locus elements. In thymocytes lacking the chromatin organizer SATB1, we identified a partial defect in Tcra gene rearrangement that was associated with reduced expression of Rag1 and Rag2 at the DP stage. SATB1 binds to the ASE and Rag promoters, facilitating inclusion of Rag2 in the chromatin hub and the loading of RNA polymerase II to both the Rag1 and Rag2 promoters. Our results provide a novel framework for understanding ASE function and demonstrate a novel role for SATB1 as a regulator of Rag locus organization and gene expression in DP thymocytes.",

One of these components possesses core histones, typical nucleosomal structure, a nuclease-resistant core containing 146 base pairs (bp) of new DNA, and all the nucleosomal species found in bulk chromatin (due to bound histone H1 and high mobility group proteins). In addition, this class of nascent chromatin exhibits a shortened repeat length of approximately 165 bp, as opposed to the 288-bp repeat of bulk chromatin. Within 10 min of DNA synthesis, the spacing of mature chromatin is established; the spacing maturation can occur in the absence of protein synthesis. The second class of nascent DNA is distinguished from the nucleosomal component by its insolubility, lack of discernible nucleosomal organization, and dependence on protein synthesis to attain typical subunit structure. This unassembled component is not free DNA, as demonstrated by its intermediate resistance to nucleolytic degradation. The structural properties and maturation requirements of this material suggest that it is the site of de novo nucleosome assembly.",

HeLa cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; control experiments demonstrated that butyrate did not significantly inhibit DNA replication for at least 70 min. Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. However, chromatin replicated in butyrate did not mature as in normal replication, but instead retained approximately 50% of its heightened sensitivity to DNase I. Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA. In contrast, sodium butyrate did not inhibit or retard the maturation of newly replicated chromatin when assayed by micrococcal nuclease digestion, as determined by the following criteria: 1) digestion to acid solubility, 2) rate of conversion to mononucleosomes, 3) repeat length, and 4) presence of non-nucleosomal DNA. Consistent with the properties of chromatin replicated in butyrate, micrococcal nuclease also did not preferentially attack the internucleosomal linkers of chromatin regions acetylated in vivo. The observation of a novel chromatin replication intermediate, which is highly sensitive to DNase I but possesses normal resistance to micrococcal nuclease, suggests that nucleosome assembly and histone deacetylation are not obligatorily coordinated. Thus, while deacetylation is required for chromatin maturation, histone acetylation apparently affects chromatin organization at a level distinct from that of core particle or linker, possibly by altering higher order structure.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1893943": "During chromatin replication and nucleosome assembly, newly synthesized histone H4 is acetylated before it is deposited onto DNA, then deacetylated as assembly proceeds. In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin). In the following report the relationships between chromatin replication, histone acetylation, and H1-mediated nucleosome aggregation were further investigated. Chromatin was replicated in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; isolated nucleosomes were stripped of linker histone, reconstituted with H1, and treated to produce Mg(2+)-soluble and Mg(2+)-insoluble chromatin fractions. Following the removal of H1, all solubility differences between chromatin replicated in sodium butyrate for 30 min (bu-chromatin) and control chromatin were lost. Reconstitution with H1 completely restored the preferential Mg(2+)-solubility of bu-chromatin, demonstrating that a reduced capacity for aggregation/condensation is an inherent feature of acetylated nascent nucleosomes; however, titration with excess H1 caused the solubility differences to be lost again. Moreover, when the core histone N-terminal \"tails\" (the sites of acetylation) were removed by trypsinization prior to reconstitution, H1 was unable to reestablish the altered solubility of chromatin replicated in butyrate. Thus, the core histone \"tails,\" and the acetylation thereof, not only modulate H1-mediated nucleosome interactions in vitro, but also strongly influence the ability of H1 to differentiate between new and old nucleosomes. The data suggest a possible mechanism for the control of H1 deposition and/or chromatin folding during nucleosome assembly.",

We found that the enhancer blocking phenotype was amplified when the insulated locus contained a weakened HS2 enhancer in which clustered point mutations eliminated interaction of the transcription factor GATA-1. The GATA-1 mutation compromised recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and RNA polymerase II to HS2. Enhancer blocking correlated with a significant depletion of nucleosomes in the core region of the insulator as revealed by micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion studies. Nucleosome depletion at 5'-HS4 was dependent on interaction of the insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and was required for enhancer blocking. These findings provide evidence that a domain of active chromatin is formed by spreading from an enhancer to a target gene and can be blocked by a nucleosome-free gap in an insulator.",

Previous studies have explored the presence of genomic features, such as CpG islands and sequence motifs, in these promoter classes, but virtually no studies have directly investigated the relationship with chromatin features. Here, we show that promoter classes are significantly differentiated by nucleosome organization and chromatin structure. Dispersed promoters display higher associations with well-positioned nucleosomes downstream of the TSS and a more clearly defined nucleosome free region upstream, while focused promoters have a less organized nucleosome structure, yet higher presence of RNA polymerase II. These differences extend to histone variants (H2A.Z) and marks (H3K4 methylation), as well as insulator binding (such as CTCF), independent of the expression levels of affected genes. Notably, differences are conserved across mammals and flies, and they provide for a clearer separation of promoter architectures than the presence and absence of CpG islands or the occurrence of stalled RNA polymerase. Computational models support the stronger contribution of chromatin features to the definition of dispersed promoters compared to focused start sites. Our results show that promoter classes defined from 5' capped transcripts not only reflect differences in the initiation process at the core promoter but also are indicative of divergent transcriptional programs established within gene-proximal nucleosome organization.",

Contrary to this belief, we show by genome-wide expression profiling that Bptf, an essential and unique subunit of the nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF), predominantly regulates the expression of a unique set of genes between diverse cell types. Coincident with its functions in gene expression, we observed that Bptf is also important for regulating nucleosome occupancy at nucleosome-free regions (NFRs), many of which are located at sites occupied by the multivalent factors Ctcf and cohesin. NURF function at Ctcf binding sites could be direct, because Bptf occupies Ctcf binding sites in vivo and has physical interactions with CTCF and the cohesin subunit SA2. Assays of several Ctcf binding sites using reporter assays showed that their regulatory activity requires Bptf in two different cell types. Focused studies at H2-K1 showed that Bptf regulates the ability of Klf4 to bind near an upstream Ctcf site, possibly influencing gene expression. In combination, these studies demonstrate that gene expression as regulated by NURF occurs partly through physical and functional interactions with the ubiquitous and multivalent factors Ctcf and cohesin.",

We used genome-wide chromosome conformation capture and super-resolution imaging to determine nuclear organization in mouse ESC and neural stem cell (NSC) derivatives. We found that loss of pluripotency is accompanied by widespread gain of structural loops. This general architectural change correlates with enhanced binding of CTCF and cohesins and more pronounced insulation of contacts across chromatin boundaries in lineage-committed cells. Reprogramming NSCs to pluripotency restores the unique features of ESC domain topology. Domains defined by the anchors of loops established upon differentiation are enriched for developmental genes. Chromatin loop formation is a pervasive structural alteration to the genome that accompanies exit from pluripotency and delineates the spatial segregation of developmentally regulated genes.",

However, it is unclear whether there also exist inter-nucleosomal communications among epigenetic modifications at single nucleosome level, and if so, what functional roles they play. Meanwhile, how clear nucleosome patterns, such as nucleosome phasing and depletion, are formed at functional regions remains an intriguing enigma. To address these questions, we developed a Bayesian network model for interactions among different histone modifications across neighboring nucleosomes, based on the framework of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). From this model, we found that robust inter-nucleosomal interactions exist around transcription start site (TSS), transcription termination sites (TTS) or around CTCF binding sites; and these inter-nucleosomal interactions are often involved in transcription regulation. In addition to these general principles, DBN also uncovered a novel specific epigenetic interaction between H2A.Z and H4K20me1 on neighboring nucleosomes, involved in nucleosome free region (NFR) and nucleosome phasing establishment or maintenance. The level of negative correlation between neighboring H2A.Z and H4K20me1 strongly correlate with the size of NFR and the strength of nucleosome phasing around TSS.

Our aim was to identify genetic risk variants associated with the development of PNP as a serious side effect of the treatment. We identified 4 new promising loci for bortezomib-induced PNP at 4q34.3 (rs6552496), 5q14.1 (rs12521798), 16q23.3 (rs8060632), and 18q21.2 (rs17748074).

There is currently no effective treatment for this tumor. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is effective for a variety of tumors, but not for GBM. The authors' goal was to demonstrate that bortezomib can be effective in the orthotopic GBM murine model if the appropriate method of drug delivery is used. In this study the Alzet mini-osmotic pump was used to bring the drug directly to the tumor in the brain, circumventing the blood-brain barrier; thus making bortezomib an effective treatment for GBM. METHODS The 2 human glioma cell lines, U87 and U251, were labeled with luciferase and used in the subcutaneous and intracranial in vivo tumor models. Glioma cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank, or intracranially into the frontal cortex of athymic nude mice. Mice bearing intracranial glioma tumors were implanted with an Alzet mini-osmotic pump containing different doses of bortezomib. The Alzet pumps were introduced directly into the tumor bed in the brain. Survival was documented for mice with intracranial tumors. RESULTS Glioma cells were sensitive to bortezomib at nanomolar quantities in vitro. In the subcutaneous in vivo xenograft tumor model, bortezomib given intravenously was effective in reducing tumor progression. However, in the intracranial glioma model, bortezomib given systemically did not affect survival. By sharp contrast, animals treated with bortezomib intracranially at the tumor site exhibited significantly increased survival. CONCLUSIONS Bypassing the blood-brain barrier by using the osmotic pump resulted in an increase in the efficacy of bortezomib for the treatment of intracranial tumors. Thus, the intratumoral administration of bortezomib into the cranial cavity is an effective approach for glioma therapy.",

In another study, we showed that parathyroid hormone 1-34 and anti-sclerostin antibody attenuates radiation-induced bone damage by accelerating DNA repair in osteoblasts. DNA damage responses are partially regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In the current study, we examined whether proteasome inhibitors have similar bone-protective effects against radiation damage. MG132 treatment greatly reduced radiation-induced apoptosis in cultured osteoblastic cells. This survival effect was owing to accelerated DNA repair as revealed by \u03b3H2AX foci and comet assays and to the up-regulation of Ku70 and DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit, essential DNA repair proteins in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Administration of bortezomib (Bzb) reversed the loss of trabecular bone structure and strength in mice at 4 wk after focal radiation. Histomorphometry revealed that Bzb significantly increased the number of osteoblasts and activity in the irradiated area and suppressed the number and activity of osteoclasts, regardless of irradiation. Two weeks of Bzb treatment accelerated DNA repair in bone-lining osteoblasts and thus promoted their survival. Meanwhile, it also inhibited bone marrow adiposity.

Here we studied the proteasome-based mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired bortezomib resistance in NSCLC cells. Various NSCLC cell lines displayed differential intrinsic sensitivities to bortezomib. High basal chymotrypsin- and caspase-like proteasome activities correlated with bortezomib resistance in these cells. Next, via stepwise selection, acquired bortezomib resistant cells were obtained with 8-70-fold increased resistance. Cross-resistance was found to proteasome inhibitors specifically targeting \u03b2-subunits, but not to the novel \u03b1-subunit-specific proteasome inhibitor (5AHQ). Consistently, bortezomib-resistant cells required higher bortezomib concentrations to induce G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, bortezomib concentration-dependent caspase cleavage, Mcl-1 and NOXA accumulation remained intact in resistant H460 and SW1573 cells, while A549 resistant cells displayed different expression profiles suggesting additional and more protein specific adaptations. Furthermore, bortezomib-resistant cells exhibited increased levels of both constitutive and immuno-\u03b2-subunits. Sequence analysis of the bortezomib-binding pocket in the \u03b25-subunit revealed Ala49Thr, Met45Val and Cys52Phe substitutions that were not previously described in solid tumors. Bortezomib-resistant cells displayed reduced catalytic proteasome activities and required higher bortezomib concentrations to achieve comparable inhibition of proteasome activity. Taken together, these findings establish that high basal levels of proteasome activity correlate with intrinsic bortezomib resistance. Furthermore, acquired bortezomib resistance in NSCLC is associated with proteasome subunit overexpression and emergence of mutant \u03b25-subunits that likely compromise bortezomib binding. \u03b1-Subunit-specific proteasome inhibitors, however, can efficiently bypass this resistance modality.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22702336": "In eukaryotic cells, degradation of most intracellular proteins is carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Recent investigations suggest that bone metabolism is also regulated by this pathway. The clinical efficacy of bortezomib, a 26S proteasome inhibitor used as an anticancer drug, has been linked to an increase in bone formation. In this study, we show that proteasome inhibitors induce expression of osteoblastic differentiation-related genes such as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase in C2C12 cells. In contrast, myogenic differentiation is inhibited. Among the proteasome inhibitors tested, bortezomib induced the greatest increase in osteocalcin expression. Although these effects were similar to that of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, proteasome inhibitors did not induce transcriptional activity of Smad1/4-dependent reporter or BMP2 signaling target gene expression. Transient transfection of osteocalcin promoter-luciferase constructs with bortezomib resulted in an increase in luciferase activity. Mutation of OSE2, but not OSE1, sites of the osteocalcin promoter diminished the bortezomib-induced activity. Also, Runx2 binding activity and protein levels were induced by bortezomib treatment. These results suggest that the bortezomib induces osteoblastic differentiation by modifying the activity of Runx2 and that the function of the proteasome in controlling degradation of differentiation-related transcription factors plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation.",

Proteasomal degradation activity is critical for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (also known as Velcade and PS-341) is a clinically effective antineoplastic drug that is FDA approved for treatment of hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Low nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib inhibited infection by HSV-1, HSV-2, and acyclovir-resistant strains. Inhibition coincided with minimal cytotoxicity. Bortezomib did not affect attachment of HSV to cells or inactivate the virus directly. Bortezomib acted early in HSV infection by perturbing two distinct proteasome-dependent steps that occur within the initial hours of infection: the transport of incoming viral nucleocapsids to the nucleus and the virus-induced disruption of host nuclear domain 10 (ND10) structures. The combination of bortezomib with acyclovir demonstrated synergistic inhibitory effects on HSV infection. Thus, bortezomib is a novel potential therapeutic for HSV with a defined mechanism of action.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viruses usurp host cell functions to advance their replicative agenda. HSV relies on cellular proteasome activity for successful infection. Proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, block HSV infection at multiple stages of the infectious cycle. Targeting host cell processes for antiviral intervention is an unconventional approach that might limit antiviral resistance. Here we demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which is a clinically effective cancer drug, has the <i>in vitro</i> features of a promising anti-HSV therapeutic. Bortezomib inhibited HSV infection during the first hours of infection at nanomolar concentrations that were minimally cytotoxic. The mechanism of bortezomib's inhibition of early HSV infection was to halt nucleocapsid transport to the nucleus and to stabilize the ND10 cellular defense complex. Bortezomib and acyclovir acted synergistically to inhibit HSV infection. Overall, we present evidence for the repurposing of bortezomib as a novel antiherpesviral agent and describe specific mechanisms of action.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21247388": "Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has emerged as a rational approach in the treatment of human cancer. Based on positive preclinical and clinical studies, bortezomib was subsequently approved for the clinical use as a front-line treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this drug has become the staple of treatment. The approval of bortezomib by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) represented a significant milestone as the first proteasome inhibitor to be implemented in the treatment of malignant disease. Bortezomib has shown a positive clinical benefit either alone or as a part of combination therapy to induce chemo-/radio-sensitization or overcome drug resistance. One of the major mechanisms of bortezomib associated with its anticancer activity is through upregulation of NOXA, which is a proapoptotic protein, and NOXA may interact with the anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 subfamily Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2, and result in apoptotic cell death in malignant cells. Another important mechanism of bortezomib is through suppression of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway resulting in the down-regulation of its anti-apoptotic target genes. Although the majority of success achieved with bortezomib has been in hematological malignancies, its effect toward solid tumors has been less than encouraging. Additionally, the widespread clinical use of bortezomib continues to be hampered by the appearance of dose-limiting toxicities, drug-resistance and interference by some natural compounds. These findings could help guide physicians in refining the clinical use of bortezomib, and encourage basic scientists to generate next generation proteasome inhibitors that broaden the spectrum of efficacy and produce a more durable clinical response in cancer patients. Other desirable applications for the use of proteasome inhibitors include the development of inhibitors against specific E3 ligases, which act at an early step in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and the discovery of less toxic and novel proteasome inhibitors from natural products and traditional medicines, which may provide more viable drug candidates for cancer chemoprevention and the treatment of cancer patients in the future.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16278210": "The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is emerging as a potent anti-cancer agent. Still, recent clinical trials have revealed a significant secondary toxicity of bortezomib. Consequently, there is much interest in dissecting the mechanism of action of this compound to rationally improve its therapeutic index. The cytotoxic effect of bortezomib is frequently characterized by interfering with downstream events derived from the accumulation of proteasomal targets. Here we identify the first chemical agent able to act upstream of the proteasome to prevent cell killing by bortezomib. Specifically, we show that the polyhydroxyl compound Tiron can function as a competitive inhibitor of bortezomib. This effect of Tiron was surprising, since it is a classical radical spin trap and was expected to scavenge reactive oxygen species produced as a consequence of bortezomib action. The inhibitory effect of Tiron against bortezomib was selective, since it was not shared by other antioxidants, such as vitamin E, MnTBAP, L-N-acetyl-cysteine, and FK-506. Comparative analyses with nonboronated proteasome inhibitors (i.e. MG132) revealed a specificity of Tiron for bortezomib. We exploited this novel feature of Tiron to define the \"point of no return\" of proteasome inhibition in melanoma cells and to block cell death in a three-dimensional model of human skin. Cells from T-cell lymphoma, breast carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer were also responsive to Tiron, suggesting a broad impact of this agent as a bortezomib blocker. These results may have important implications for the analysis of bortezomib in vivo and for the design of drug mixtures containing proteasome inhibitors.",

Despite its demonstrated clinical success, some patients are deprived of treatment due to primary refractoriness or development of resistance during therapy. To investigate the role of the duration of proteasome inhibition in the anti-tumor response of bortezomib, we established clonal isolates of HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells adapted to continuous exposure of bortezomib. These cells were ~30-fold resistant to bortezomib. Two novel and distinct mutations in the \u03b25 subunit, Cys63Phe, located distal to the binding site in a helix critical for drug binding, and Arg24Cys, found in the propeptide region were found in all resistant clones. The latter mutation is a natural variant found to be elevated in frequency in patients with MM. Proteasome activity and levels of both the constitutive and immunoproteasome were increased in resistant cells, which correlated to an increase in subunit gene expression. These changes correlated with a more rapid recovery of proteasome activity following brief exposure to bortezomib. Increased recovery rate was not due to increased proteasome turnover as similar findings were seen in cells co-treated with cycloheximide. When we exposed resistant cells to the irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib we noted a slower rate of recovery of proteasome activity as compared to bortezomib in both parental and resistant cells. Importantly, carfilzomib maintained its cytotoxic potential in the bortezomib resistant cell lines. Therefore, resistance to bortezomib, can be overcome with irreversible inhibitors, suggesting prolonged proteasome inhibition induces a more potent anti-tumor response.",

Instead, we report, a low Bortezomib concentration, contrary to expectation, achieves severe inhibition of proteasome activity in MM cells: the degree of inhibition exceeds what one would expect from the small proportion of active-sites that Bortezomib inhibits. Our data indicate that Bortezomib achieves this severe inhibition by triggering secondary changes in proteasome structure that further inhibit proteasome activity. Comparing MM cells to other, Bortezomib-resistant, cancer cells shows that the degree of proteasome inhibition is the greatest in MM cells and only there leads to proteasome stress, providing an explanation for why Bortezomib is effective against MM but not other cancers.",

One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA-binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be investigated as a candidate gene in other instances of hybrid sterility in metazoans.",

In human, several PRDM9 SNPs have been implicated in sterility as well.

Screening for other potential histone marks, we identified H3K36 as a second histone residue that could also be mono-, di-, and trimethylated by PRDM9 as efficiently as H3K4. Overexpression of PRDM9 in HEK293 cells also resulted in a significant increase in trimethylated H3K36 and H3K4 further confirming our in vitro observations.

This is essential for fertility and contributes to genome evolution. In many eukaryotes, sites of meiotic recombination, also called hotspots, are regions of accessible chromatin, but in many vertebrates, their location follows a distinct pattern and is specified by PR domain-containing protein 9 (PRDM9). The specification of meiotic recombination hotspots is achieved by the different activities of PRDM9: DNA binding, histone methyltransferase, and interaction with other proteins. Remarkably, PRDM9 activity leads to the erosion of its own binding sites and the rapid evolution of its DNA-binding domain. PRDM9 may also contribute to reproductive isolation, as it is involved in hybrid sterility potentially due to a reduction of its activity in specific heterozygous contexts.",

We found that although the post-SET zinc finger and the KRAB domains are not essential for the methyltransferase activity of PRDM9 in cell culture, the KRAB domain mutant mice show only residual PRDM9 methyltransferase activity and undergo meiotic arrest.

The gene responsible for X-linked OS, FXY/MID1, is located on the short arm of the human X chromosome within Xp22.3 and encodes a protein with both an RBCC (RING finger, B-box, coiled coil) and a B30.2 domain. The Fxy gene in mice is also located on the X chromosome but spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in this species.

The mouse Fxy2 gene is located on the distal part of the mouse X chromosome within a region syntenic to Xq22. Analysis of genes flanking both FXY/MID1 and FXY2 (as well as their counterparts in mouse) suggests that these regions may have arisen as a result of an intrachromosomal duplication on an ancestral X chromosome. We have also identified in both FXY2 and FXY/MID1 proteins a conserved fibronectin type III domain located between the RBCC and B30.2 domains that has implications for understanding protein function.

Chromosomal position can also have an influence [1] [2]. The pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of mammalian sex chromosomes is a small region of sequence identity that is the site of an obligatory pairing and recombination event between the X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis [3] [4] [5] [6]. During female meiosis, X chromosomes can pair and recombine along their entire length. Recombination in the PAR is therefore approximately 10 times greater in male meiosis compared with female meiosis [4] [5] [6]. The gene Fxy (also known as MID1 [7]) spans the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) in the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus domesticus, C57BL/6) such that the 5' three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome but the seven exons encoding the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of the protein are located within the PAR and are therefore present on both the X and Y chromosomes [8]. In humans [7] [9], the rat, and the wild mouse species Mus spretus, the gene is entirely X-unique. Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique. Thus, chromosomal position can directly affect the rate of evolution of a gene. This finding also provides support for the suggestion that regions of the genome with a high recombination frequency, such as the PAR, may have an intrinsically elevated rate of sequence divergence.",

The maximum detection efficiency for 1275 keV \u03b3-rays emitted from <sup>22</sup> Na was approximately 7% at the scanner's center, and the minimum detection efficiency was 5.1% at the edge of the field of view. Dual-radionuclide imaging of the point sources and rod phantom revealed that our system maintained PET's intrinsic spatial resolution and quantitative nature for the second tracer. We also successfully acquired simultaneous double- and triple-coincidence events from a mouse containing <sup>18</sup> F-fluoro-deoxyglucose and <sup>22</sup> Na dissolved in water. The dual-tracer distributions in the mouse obtained by our MI-PET were reasonable from the viewpoints of physiology and pharmacokinetics. This study demonstrates the feasibility of multiple-tracer imaging using PET with additional \u03b3-ray detectors. This method holds promise for enabling the reconstruction of quantitative multiple-tracer images and could be very useful for analyzing multiple-molecular dynamics.",

Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 \u00d7 10(-4)). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 \u00d7 10(-15)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 \u00d7 10(-11)) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 \u00d7 10(-13)).

This SNP is located within the cell adhesion molecule 2 (<i>CADM2</i>) gene. We aimed to validate this finding in our sample of 944 cognitively normal Jewish elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), a population which is at risk for cognitive decline and dementia.<b>Methods:</b> Using linear regression, we studied the association of rs17518584 with DSST performance, adjusting for demographic, T2D-related characteristics and cardiovascular factors. In secondary analyses, associations with performance in four cognitive domains (episodic memory, language/semantic categorisation, attention/working memory and executive function) and overall cognition were examined.<b>Results:</b> Controlling for sex, age at cognitive assessment, years of education and ancestry, we found a significant association of rs17518584 with DSST performance (<i>P</i> = 0.013), consistent with the originally reported effect direction. Results remained significant even when the additional covariates (T2D-related and cardiovascular factors) were included in the analysis (<i>P</i> = 0.034).

Most of the entropy of short read data lies not in the sequence of read bases themselves but in their Quality Scores-the confidence measurement that each base has been sequenced correctly. Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses. We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy. Our model leverages a corpus of k-mers to reduce the entropy of the quality scores and thereby the compressibility of these data (in FASTQ or SAM/BAM/CRAM files), resulting in compression ratios that significantly exceeds those of other methods. Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy. In addition to extensive empirical evaluation, we also derive novel theoretical insights that explain the empirical performance and pitfalls of corpus-based quality score compression schemes in general. Finally, we show that as a positive side effect of compression, the model can lead to improved genotyping accuracy.

It reduces apoptosis in mouse models of Huntington's disease and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is in clinical trial for sporadic ALS. Because apoptosis also occurs after brain and spinal cord (SCI) injury, its prevention may be useful in improving recovery. We analyzed minocycline's neuroprotective effects over 28 days following contusion SCI and found significant functional recovery compared to tetracycline. Histology, immunocytochemistry, and image analysis indicated statistically significant tissue sparing, reduced apoptosis and microgliosis, and less activated caspase-3 and substrate cleavage. Since our original report in abstract form, others have published both positive and negative effects of minocycline in various rodent models of SCI and with various routes of administration. We have since found decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as caspase-3 mRNA expression, as possible mechanisms of action for minocycline's ameliorative action. These results support reports that modulating apoptosis, caspases, and microglia provide promising therapeutic targets for prevention and/or limiting the degree of functional loss after CNS trauma.

Several trials are planned or are in progress to assess whether minocycline slows human neurodegeneration. We aimed to test the efficacy of minocycline as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We did a multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled phase III trial. After a 4-month lead-in phase, 412 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or minocycline in escalating doses of up to 400 mg/day for 9 months. The primary outcome measure was the difference in rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). Secondary outcome measures were forced vital capacity (FVC), manual muscle testing (MMT), quality of life, survival, and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18802797": "A recent publication of the results of a clinical trial of minocycline in 412 ALS patient has aroused considerable controversy in the ALS scientific community. As on previous occasions, the results obtained in the laboratory are not reproduced in clinical practice. The reasons for this new disappointment in translational medicine are analysed by applying the successes obtained in the experimental animal model for ALS to humans. The most frequently suggested causes for explaining these continuous failures are unawareness of the correct dosage to be used, the ideal duration of the clinical trial in phase III, sample size, the search for a primary outcome for measurement other than survival, the need for biomarkers giving information on the progression of the disease and whether this is modified by the introduction of the drug for study. Debate focuses on whether the transgenic mouse model of ALS which expresses SOD1 mutations which we have been using for more than a decade is an exact reflection of the clinical profile and the physiopathogenic mechanisms present in patients with spo- radic ALS. There is the possibility that depending on the dose administered, minocycline can be a neuroprotector or a neurotoxin. In other words, at a dose of 200 mg/day, this drug behaves like &lt;&lt;Dr. Jekyll&gt;&gt; and like &lt;&lt;Mr. Hyde&gt;&gt; at doses of 400 mg. For the authors of the trial, this possibility does not seem to be the cause of the disappointing results obtained. However, they acknowledge that one of the limitations of their study was that it was impossible to compare the effects of minocycline in the patient after receiving 200 or 400 mg. For many other researchers running ongoing clinical trials in both ALS and other neurological diseases, the dose of 200 mg/day is chosen as ideal for testing the effectiveness of minocycline in patients. The strategy of administering the maximum dose of a drug to be tested may give rise to misleading results. We agree with the opinion of other authors, who say that minocycline should be given a second chance.",

EVs can cross the physiological barriers, and a variety of biological fluids are enriched in them. EVs are a heterogeneous population of vesicles, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. The different subpopulations of vesicles can be differentiated by size and origin, in which exosomes (~100 nm and from endocytic origin) are the most studied so far. EVs have essential roles in cell-to-cell communication and are critical modulators of immune response under normal and pathological conditions. Pregnancy is a unique situation of immune-modulation in which the maternal immune system protects the fetus from allogenic rejection and maintains the immunosurveillance. The placenta is a vital organ that performs a multitude of functions to support the pregnancy. The EVs derived from the human placenta have crucial roles in regulating the maternal immune response for successful pregnancy outcome. Placenta-derived vesicles perform a myriad of functions like suppression of immune reaction to the developing fetus and establishment and maintenance of a systemic inflammatory response to combat infectious intruders. A fine-tuning of these mechanisms is quintessential for successful completion of pregnancy and healthy outcome for mother and fetus. Dysregulation in the mechanisms mentioned above can lead to several pregnancy disorders. In this review, we summarize the current literature regarding the critical roles played by the EVs in immunomodulation during pregnancy with particular attention to the placenta-derived exosomes.",

Ectosomes are formed by outward blebbing from the plasma membrane and are then released by proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface. Apoptotic bodies are generated on apoptotic cell shrinkage and death. Extracellular vesicles are released when the cells are activated or undergo apoptosis under inflammatory conditions. The number and types of released EVs are different according to the pathophysiological status of the disease. Therefore, EVs can be novel biomarkers for various lung diseases.

Many small molecules affect the function of cellular signaling pathways. As EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway proteins are frequently altered in TNBC, we have studied the gene expression of key proteins of this pathway. The semiquantitative PCR results demonstrated the down-regulated expression of PDPK1 (positive regulator) and Akt (key activator) as well as up-regulated expression of PTEN (negative regulator), which suggested the interaction of guai-2-en-10\u03b1-ol with upstream protein.

Most genes have a nucleosome-depleted region at the promoter and an array of regularly spaced nucleosomes phased relative to the transcription start site. In vitro, the three known yeast nucleosome spacing enzymes (CHD1, ISW1 and ISW2) form arrays with different spacing. We used genome-wide nucleosome sequencing to determine whether these enzymes space nucleosomes differently in vivo We find that CHD1 and ISW1 compete to set the spacing on most genes, such that CHD1 dominates genes with shorter spacing and ISW1 dominates genes with longer spacing. In contrast, ISW2 plays a minor role, limited to transcriptionally inactive genes. Heavily transcribed genes show weak phasing and extreme spacing, either very short or very long, and are depleted of linker histone (H1). Genes with longer spacing are enriched in H1, which directs chromatin folding. We propose that CHD1 directs short spacing, resulting in eviction of H1 and chromatin unfolding, whereas ISW1 directs longer spacing, allowing H1 to bind and condense the chromatin. Thus, competition between the two remodelers to set the spacing on each gene may result in a highly dynamic chromatin structure.",

Moreover, forms of IR characterized by high linear energy transfer (LET) induce not only isolated DSBs but also DSB clusters - multiple DSBs in close proximity -that pose increased risks for the cell. DSB clusters can destabilize chromatin locally and compromise processing of individual DSBs within the cluster. Since the discovery of chromothripsis, a phenomenon whereby multiple DSBs locally generated by a catastrophic event causes genomic rearrangements that feed carcinogenesis, DSB clusters receive increased attention also in the field of cancer. While formation of DSB clusters after exposure to high LET is a direct and inherent consequence of the spatial distribution of the constituting energy deposition events, also called track structure, the sources of local genomic shattering underpinning chromothripsis are under investigation. Notably, many consequences of DSB clusters in the affected genome reflect processing by pathways that have evolved to repair DSBs, but which operate with widely different degrees of fidelity. The molecular underpinnings and the basis of the underlying repair pathway choices that ultimately lead to the observed consequences from DSB clusters remain unknown. We developed a tractable model of DSB clustering that allows direct analysis in cells of the consequences of certain configurations of DSB clusters. We outline the rationale for the development of this model and describe its key characteristics. We summarize results suggesting that DSB clusters compromise the first-line DSB-processing pathways of c-NHEJ and HRR, increasing as a consequence the contribution of alt-EJ, which has high propensity of generating chromosomal rearrangements.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079875": "The induction of DNA interstrand cross-links by ionizing radiation has been largely ignored in favour of studies on double-strand break formation and repair. At least part of the problem is technical; it is difficult to detect and quantify interstrand cross-links when the same agent forms both cross-links and single strand breaks because the detection of interstrand cross-links generally involves a denaturation step. Our group has studied the induction of interstrand cross-links following irradiation of DNA containing bromouracil at specific sites. We found that the formation of interstrand cross-links requires the presence of a few (3-5) mismatched bases, comprising the bromouracil. In the absence of mismatched bases, no radiation-induced cross-linking was observed; however, even in the absence of bromouracil, cross-linking still occurred, albeit at a lower efficiency. Our molecular modelling studies demonstrate that the mobility of the bases in the mismatched region is essential for the cross-linking process. Thus, our hypothesis is that ionizing radiation induces DNA interstrand cross-links in non-hybridized regions of DNA. Some obvious examples of such DNA regions are replication forks, transcription bubbles and the D-loop of telomeres. However, an abundance of studies have made it clear that there must be many single-stranded regions in the genome, such as hairpins and cruciforms. For example, alpha satellite DNA, in centromere regions of human chromosomes, forms hairpins. Thus, a variety of non-B DNA structures (hairpins, slipped DNA and tetrahelical structures) exist in the genome and should be susceptible to the formation of radiation-induced interstrand cross-links. Although interstrand cross-links have thus far been virtually ignored in radiation biology, it will be worthwhile to develop methods to detect their presence following exposure of cells to biologically relevant levels of ionizing radiation, since, on a per lesions basis, they are probably more toxic than double-strand breaks.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23948232": "While much is known about radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair, the question of how deletions of different sizes arise as a result of the processing of DSBs by the cell's repair systems has not been fully answered. In order to bridge this gap between DSBs and deletions, we critically reviewed published data on mechanisms pertaining to: (a) repair of DNA DSBs (from basic studies in this area); (b) formation of naturally occurring structural variation (SV) - especially of deletions - in the human genome (from genomic studies) and (c) radiation-induced mutations and structural chromosomal aberrations in mammalian somatic cells (from radiation mutagenesis and radiation cytogenetic studies). The specific aim was to assess the relative importance of the postulated mechanisms in generating deletions in the human genome and examine whether empirical data on radiation-induced deletions in mouse germ cells are consistent with predictions of these mechanisms. The mechanisms include (a) NHEJ, a DSB repair process that does not require any homology and which functions in all stages of the cell cycle (and is of particular relevance in G0/G1); (b) MMEJ, also a DSB repair process but which requires microhomology and which presumably functions in all cell cycle stages; (c) NAHR, a recombination-based DSB repair mechanism which operates in prophase I of meiosis in germ cells; (d) MMBIR, a microhomology-mediated, replication-based mechanism which operates in the S phase of the cell cycle, and (e) strand slippage during replication (involved in the origin of small insertions and deletions (INDELs). Our analysis permits the inference that, between them, these five mechanisms can explain nearly all naturally occurring deletions of different sizes identified in the human genome, NAHR and MMBIR being potentially more versatile in this regard. With respect to radiation-induced deletions, the basic studies suggest that those arising as a result of the operation of NHEJ/MMEJ processes, as currently formulated, are expected to be relatively small. However, data on induced mutations in mouse spermatogonial stem cells (irradiation in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and DSB repair presumed to be via NHEJ predominantly) show that most are associated with deletions of different sizes, some in the megabase range. There is thus a 'discrepancy' between what the basic studies suggest and the empirical observations in mutagenesis studies. This discrepancy, however, is only an apparent but not a real one. It can be resolved by considering the issue of deletions in the broader context of and in conjunction with the organization of chromatin in chromosomes and nuclear architecture, the conceptual framework for which already exists in studies carried out during the past fifteen years or so. In this paper, we specifically hypothesize that repair of DSBs induced in chromatin loops may offer a basis to explain the induction of deletions of different sizes and suggest an approach to test the hypothesis. We emphasize that the bridging of the gap between induced DSB and resulting deletions of different sizes is critical for current efforts in computational modeling of genetic risks.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29787435": "Exposure of cells to ionizing radiation induces DNA double-strand breaks. To repair double-strand breaks correctly, cells must distinguish between the ends of chromosomes (telomeres) and DNA double-strand breaks within chromosomes. Double-strand breaks in telomeric DNA may lead to telomere shortening and mutagenesis. Eukaryotic cells repair double-strand breaks primarily by two mechanisms: error-free homologous recombination and error-prone nonhomologous end joining, of which homologous recombination is used in early meiotic prophase I to create recombined haploid gametes by two meiotic cell divisions lacking an intervening S-phase. Genotoxic exposures put meiosis at risk to transmit mutations, and ionizing radiation is known to induce large double-strand break-marking phospho (gamma)-H2AX foci along the cores and ends of mouse meiotic chromosomes. However, it remained unclear through which repair pathway the ionizing radiation-induced telomeric double-strand breaks are repaired in late prophase I spermatocytes. Using male wild-type and nonhomologous end joining-deficient (severe combined immunodeficient) mice, this study investigated the kinetics of in vivo double-strand break formation and repair at telomeres of late prophase I chromosomes up to 12 h after 0.5 Gy of whole-body gamma irradiation. Late pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes revealed overlapping gamma-H2AX and telomere repeat signal foci, indicating telomeric DNA damage. The comparison of double-strand break repair rates at telomeres and internal prophase chromosome sites revealed a more rapid double-strand break repair at wild-type telomeres during the first hour after irradiation. Increased double-strand break foci numbers at nonhomologous end joining-deficient telomeres and chromosomes and a slowed repair rate in this DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit mutant suggest that the fast repair of double-strand breaks in telomeric DNA repeats during late prophase I is largely mediated by canonical nonhomologous end joining.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7683090": "DNA double-strand breaks are considered to be the most deleterious lesion induced by ionizing radiation. However, the mechanism of rejoining of these lesions has not been extensively studied at the molecular level. We have used a shuttle vector, pHAZE, to analyze the mechanism of rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks in human cells. The advantage of this vector system is that, unlike many previously described shuttle vectors, it has a large target gene for the detection of deletions and it is maintained as a freely replicating episome with chromatin conformation in the nucleus of human cells. In this study we compare data obtained on the spectrum of mutations induced in pHAZE by ionizing radiation (alpha-particles) and restriction enzymes (PvuII, ClaI, and PvuI). Unlike ionizing radiation, restriction enzymes induce double-strand breaks in DNA with known end structures at defined locations and therefore provide a model system for analyzing cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks. Exposure of human cells containing the vector to alpha-particle irradiation produced both point mutations and large deletions in pHAZE. When the junction regions of the deletions were sequenced it was found that 65% were rejoined with up to 6 bp of homology at the junction region. Analysis of restriction-enzyme-induced mutations suggests that double-strand break ends are modified to facilitate rejoining and that the type of modification is characteristic for different end structures. Double-strand breaks with cohesive ends appear to have fewer modifications introduced at the break points before rejoining than breaks with blunt ends. When considered in relation to the data obtained with ionizing radiation this suggests that the presence of cohesive sequences either at, or in proximity to, the ends enhances rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1540967": "Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to examine the influence of chromatin structure on the induction of DNA double strand breaks by gamma-irradiation in CHO-WBL cells, nuclei, and a series of protein-depleted chromatin substrates. We developed a method to isolate intact nuclei in agarose plugs that avoids DNA shearing and nucleolytic degradation during sample preparation, and facilitates nuclear protein extraction. Agarose plug-isolated nuclei are extracted with increasing concentrations of NaCl to selectively strip off: (a) nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHP); (b) NHP and histone H1; (c) NHP, H1, and histone H2A-H2B dimers; or (d) NHP, H1, and H2A-H2B dimers and histone H3-H4 tetramers. Following treatment with up to 40 Gy of gamma-radiation, DNA from each sample is purified and the relative induction of DNA double strand breaks is assayed by asymmetric field inversion gel electrophoresis. At a dose of 20 Gy, removal of nonhistone proteins from nuclei results in a 3-fold increase in DNA double strand breaks, compared to intact CHO cells. Additional stripping of histone H1 results in an incremental increase in double strand break induction, whereas further removal of H2A-H2B dimers yields a greater than 10-fold increase in DNA double strand breaks compared to intact CHO cells. The dose-response profile for this latter sample is similar to that observed for purified DNA. These data indicate that distinct classes of chromosomal proteins afford the DNA with different levels of protection against gamma-ray-induced DNA double strand breaks. Thus, chromatin domains that differ in tertiary structure and protein composition may also differ in their susceptibility to DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation and, perhaps, other clastogens.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10639091": "Ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs such as bleomycin, calichieamycin, neocarzinostatin chromophore, and other synthetic agents can produce both single and double strand breaks in DNA. The ability to study the structure-activity relationships of single and double-strand break repair, lethality, and mutagenesis in vivo is complicated by the numerous types and sites of DNA cleavage products that can be induced by such agents. The ability to \"cage\" such breaks in DNA might help to further such studies and additionally afford a mechanism for activating and deactivating nucleic acid based drugs and probes. The major type of single strand break induced by ionizing radiation is a 3'- and 5'-phosphate terminated single nucleotide gap. Previously, a caged strand break of this type had been developed that was designed to produce the 5'-phosphate directly upon irradiation with 366 nm light, and the 3'-phosphate by a subsequent beta-elimination reaction [Ordoukhanian, P., and Taylor, J.-S. (1995) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 9570]. Unfortunately, the release of the 3'-phosphate group was quite slow at pH 7. To circumvent this problem, a second caged strand break has been developed that produces the 3'-phosphate directly upon irradiation, and the 5'-phosphate by a subsequent beta-elimination reaction. When this caged strand break was used in tandem with the previous caged strand break, 5'- and 3'-phosphate terminated gaps could be directly produced by irradiation with 366 nm light. These caged single strand breaks were also incorporated in tandem into hairpin substrates to demonstrate that they could be used to cage double strand breaks. These caged single strand breaks should be generally useful for generating site-specific DNA single and double strand breaks and gaps, using wavelengths and doses of light that are nondetrimental to biological systems. Because the position of the single strand break can be varied, it should now be possible to examine the effect of the sequence context and cleavage pattern of single and double strand breaks on the lethality and mutagenicity of this important class of DNA damage.",

Because a number of cancer therapies exert cytotoxic effects via the initiation of double-strand breaks, cancers comprised of cells carrying BRCA2 gene mutations may be more amenable to treatment with agents that cause such breaks. We identified a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line lacking one copy of the BRCA2 gene and containing a mutation (6174delT) in the remaining copy. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted with this cell line and with other carcinoma cell lines matched for similar genetic mutations, similar differentiation status, and/or similar carcinoma type to examine double-strand break repair, sensitivity to drugs that induce double-strand breaks, and radiation sensitivity. BRCA2-defective cells were unable to repair the double-strand DNA breaks induced by ionizing radiation. These cells were also markedly sensitive to mitoxantrone, amsacrine, and etoposide (drugs that induce double-strand breaks) (two-sided P = .002) and to ionizing radiation (two-sided P = .001). Introduction of antisense BRCA2 deoxyribonucleotides into cells possessing normal BRCA2 function led to increased sensitivity to mitoxantrone (two-sided P = .008). Tumors formed by injection of BRCA2-defective cells into nude mice were highly sensitive (&gt;90% tumor size reduction, two-sided P = .002) to both ionizing radiation and mitoxantrone when compared with tumors exhibiting normal BRCA2 function. Histologic analysis of irradiated BRCA2-defective tumors showed a large degree of necrosis compared with that observed for control tumors possessing normal BRCA2 function. BRCA2-defective cancer cells are highly sensitive to agents that cause double-strand breaks in DNA.",

Prior studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients exhibit increased numbers of DNA strand breaks after exposure to ionizing radiation, but these studies did not specifically measure DNA double strand breaks and it is not known whether chemical carcinogens produce similar effects. PBMC from 32 women undergoing breast surgery were genotyped at nine loci of seven DNA repair genes. DNA double strand break repair was measured using the neutral comet assay after exposure to ionizing radiation (0.5 Gy) or bioactivated benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P, 5 microM. PBMC from breast cancer patients showed higher levels of residual DNA double strand breaks 30 min after exposure to radiation than PBMC from patients with benign breast disease (1.40 times baseline [95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.29-1.51] versus 1.24 times baseline [95% CI 1.15-1.33], respectively, P = 0.04). The response to B[a]P trended in the same direction, but did not reach statistical significance. The MGMT K178R variant genotype was associated with improved DNA double strand break repair in PBMC exposed to B[a]P. Reduced repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks in PBMC is a robust biomarker of breast cancer risk. Reduced DNA repair capacity may have a genetic component even in sporadic breast cancer.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652722": "Genomes are continually subjected to DNA damage whether they are induced from intrinsic physiological processes or extrinsic agents. Double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are the most injurious type of DNA damage, being induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and cytotoxic agents used in cancer treatment. The failure to repair DSBs can result in aberrant chromosomal abnormalities which lead to cancer development. An intricate network of DNA damage signaling pathways is usually activated to eliminate these damages and to restore genomic stability. These signaling pathways include the activation of cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair mechanisms, and apoptosis induction, also known as DNA damage response (DDR)-mechanisms. Remarkably, the homologous recombination (HR) is the major DSBs repairing pathway, in which <i>RAD52</i> gene has a crucial repairing role by promoting the annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA and by stimulating <i>RAD51</i> recombinase activity. Evidence suggests that variations in <i>RAD52</i> expression can influence HR activity and, subsequently, influence the predisposition and treatment efficacy of cancer. In this review, we present several reports in which the down or upregulation of <i>RAD52</i> seems to be associated with different carcinogenic processes. In addition, we discuss <i>RAD52</i> inhibition in DDR-defective cancers as a possible target to improve cancer therapy efficacy.",

Increasing understanding of DNA damage signaling has provided an ever-expanding list of modulators reported to orchestrate DNA damage repair and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is the master regulator and main transducer of the DSB response. Increasingly, it is being realized that DNA damage response is a synchronized and branched network that functionalizes different molecular cascades to activate special checkpoints, thus temporarily arresting progression of the cell cycle while damage is being assessed and processed. It is noteworthy that both nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics have revolutionized the field of molecular biology and rapidly accumulating experimental evidence has started to shed light on biological activities of a wide range of phytochemicals reported to modulate cell cycle, DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis as evidenced by cell-based studies. In this review, we have attempted to provide an overview of DNA damage signaling, how ATM signaling regulates tumor necrosis factors-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced intracellular network. We also illuminate on how resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, jaceosidin, cucurbitacin, apigenin, genistein, and others trigger activation of ATM in different cancer cells as well as agents for ATM inactivation. Understanding the interplay of TRAIL-induced intracellular signaling and ATM modulation of downstream effectors is very important.

The ability to repair was deduced from the study of the DNA sedimentation profiles in alkaline sucrose gradients. It was found that lymphocytes from Down's syndrome patients are less efficient in repairing single-strand DNA breaks than are lymphocytes from normal individuals. This significantly increased fraction of unrepaired DNA strand breaks might be associated with the unusually high level of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations as compared with normals.",

The goal of this study was to define levels and dynamic trends of cancer incidence at whole and some separate sites in groups of Ukrainian population affected by the Chornobyl accident during a long period of observation. Materials and methods. Those groups were Chornobyl accident recovery operation workers (CRW) of 1986-1987 years of participation, evacuees from Prypyat town and 30-km zone and residents of the most contaminated territories of Ukraine. Analysis was carried out with the standard methods of descriptive epidemiology: calculation of crude, age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates with standard errors and confidence intervals. Results, discussion and conclusions. This study showed that all cancer incidences exceeded the national level only in CRW group. Decrease of cancer incidence rate in the recent years might be caused by shortened average life expectancy in Ukrainian population, especially in males. Statistically significant increase of leukemia incidence in CRW group was registered as well. Besides, in all three main affected groups there was revealed significant excess of thyroid cancer. Irradiation of thyroid due to radioactive iodine fallouts might be a main cause of this phenomenon. Increase of thyroid cancer incidence was registered not only in children, but also in adolescents and adults. Appearance of excess thyroid cancer cases as an effect of radiation exposure tends to increase during the time. Significant excess was also revealed for breast cancer in female CRW group. Because latency period for different nosological forms of radiation-induced malignant tumors varies widely, profound attention in further studies should be drawn not only to thyroid, breast cancers and leukemia, but also to malignancies with longer latent period: lung, stomach, colon, ovary, urinary bladder, kidney cancer and multiple myeloma.",

Therefore, the influence of radiation as a risk factor for cancer development has been among the most studied external factors over the last 6 decades, particularly with respect to radiosensitive tissues and organs. It has been known that female breast tissue is highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation, particularly when exposure takes place at younger age. All women are exposed to low doses of radiation for several common reasons (kind of occupation, medical diagnostic procedures, residence background radiation) whose effects on breast cancer development cannot be documented, and thus it is believed that ionizing radiation is not primary or major risk factor leading to development of breast cancer. Radiobiological studies revealed a specific event caused by radiation through recognition of the critical target in radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Accordingly, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation are evidenced both in vitro and in vivo, although the incidence of radiation-induced cancers is low. The highest risk of radiation- induced breast cancer is evidenced in the sub-population of female patients who have undergone radiotherapy for either malignant or non-malignant diseases, including benign breast diseases in their childhood or young age. Therefore, as a means of prevention in this group of population, indications for application of ionizing radiation, both diagnostic and therapeutic, should be highly selective, meaning that radiation should be applied only if the possible benefit outweighs the risk.",

We used Poisson regression to quantify associations between estimated red bone marrow absorbed dose and leukaemia and lymphoma mortality. Doses were accrued at very low rates (mean 1.1 mGy per year, SD 2.6). The excess relative risk of leukaemia mortality (excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) was 2.96 per Gy (90% CI 1.17-5.21; lagged 2 years), most notably because of an association between radiation dose and mortality from chronic myeloid leukaemia (excess relative risk per Gy 10.45, 90% CI 4.48-19.65).

A major clue to the genesis of Ewing's tumor comes not from defining persons at high risk but from the observation that blacks are at unusually low risk. The neoplasm does not aggregate in families and is not part of any known syndrome. No environmental causes have been identified. By contrast, osteosarcoma may be caused by external or internal ionizing radiation, and it aggregated in families with the same tumor or with dissimilar tumors and in certain genetic disorders of bone. In man and in dogs, the frequency of the neoplasm is related to bone mass and growth. Rhabdomyosarcoma of the upper versus the lower limbs seems related to muscle mass. Age peaks in the occurrence of the tumor elsewhere vary with the anatomic site; head and neck tumors develop in early childhood and urogenital tumors both in early years and in adolescence.

Ionizing radiation exposure is a risk factor for development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, a histological subtype of esophageal cancer that is highly aggressive and is associated with poor patient prognosis. This study investigated the effects of ionizing radiation on the microenvironment and intercellular communication as it relates to esophageal carcinogenesis. We demonstrate that normal esophageal epithelial cells exhibited increased migration and invasion when cultured in the presence of irradiated stromal fibroblasts or with conditioned medium derived from irradiated stromal fibroblasts. Cytokine antibody arrays and ELISAs were used to identify hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as an abundant protein that is secreted by esophageal fibroblasts at twofold increased levels in culture medium after \u03b3 irradiation. Reverse transcription qPCR analysis confirmed an approximately 50% increase in mRNA levels for HGF at 1 h in irradiated fibroblasts compared to unirradiated controls. Recombinant HGF stimulated increased wound healing, migration and invasion of esophageal epithelial cells, while blocking antibodies against HGF significantly decreased migration and invasion of epithelial cells in coculture with irradiated fibroblasts. Since HGF is known to direct cell migration, invasion and metastasis in a variety of tissues, including the esophagus, its modulation by ionizing radiation may have important implications for nontargeted pathways that influence radiation carcinogenesis in the esophagus.",

To test this hypothesis, the in vitro radiation sensitivity was measured by using both G(0) and G(2) chromosome radiosensitivity assays, on 46 subjects (23 BC patients and 23 healthy subjects).

The most common types of kidney cancer are renal cell carcinoma and renal pelvis carcinoma. It has been posited that these entities differ in their degree of radiogenicity. Recent analyses of cancer incidence and mortality in the Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors have examined associations between ionizing radiation and renal cell carcinoma, but these analyses have not reported results for cancer of the renal pelvis and ureters. This paper reports the results of analyses of kidney cancer incidence during the period 1958-1998 among 105,427 atomic bomb survivors. Poisson regression methods were used to derive estimates of associations between radiation dose (in sievert, Sv) and cancer of the renal parenchyma (n = 167), and cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter (n = 80). Heterogeneity by cancer site was tested by joint modeling of cancer risks. Radiation dose was positively associated with cancers of the renal pelvis and ureter [excess relative rate (ERR)/Sv = 1.65; 90% confidence interval (CI): 0.37, 3.78]. The magnitude of this association was larger than the estimated association between radiation dose and cancer of the renal parenchyma (ERR/Sv = 0.27; 90% CI = -0.19, 0.98). While the association between radiation and cancer of the renal parenchyma was of greater magnitude at ages &lt;55 years (ERR/Sv = 2.82; 90% CI = 0.45, 8.89) than at older attained ages (ERR/Sv = -0.11; 90% CI = nd, 0.53), the association between radiation and cancers of the renal pelvis and ureter varied minimally across these categories of attained age. A test of heterogeneity of type-specific risks provides modest support for the conclusion that risks vary by kidney cancer site (LRT = 2.34, 1 d.f., P = 0.13). Since some studies of radiation-exposed populations examine these sites in aggregate, results were also derived for the combined category of cancer of the renal parenchyma, renal pelvis and ureters. Overall, there was a positive association between radiation and the combined category of cancer of the renal parenchyma, renal pelvis and ureters (ERR/Sv = 0.60, 90% CI: 0.09, 1.30). Updated follow-up of the LSS cohort provides substantial additional information on the association between radiation and cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter, a site not examined in recent reports on analyses of these data. The results are suggestive of differences between the different regions of the kidney in sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation.",

Inclusion criteria were studies including children with ITW diagnosis, reporting use of measurement tools or methods describing lower limb characteristics, published in peer-reviewed journals, and in English. The relevant psychometric properties of measurement tools were extracted, and assessed for reported reliability and validity. Included articles were assessed for risk of bias using McMaster quality assessment tool. Results were descriptively synthesized and logistic regression used to determine associations between common assessments. From 3164 retrieved studies, 37 full texts were screened and 27 full texts included. There were 27 different measurement tools described across joint range of motion measurement, gait analysis, electromyography, accelerometer, strength, neurological or radiology assessment. Interventional studies were more likely to report range of motion and gait analysis outcomes, than observational studies. Alvarez classification tool in conjunction with Vicon motion system appeared the contemporary choice for describing ITW gait. There was no significant association between the use of range of motion and gait analysis outcomes and any other outcome tool or assessment in all studies (p &gt; 0.05).There was limited reliability and validity reporting for many outcome measures.

At the group level, the H-reflex properties did not differ, but at the individual level, in 7 of 25 idiopathic toe walkers, some of the H-reflex parameters fell out of normal limits of typically developing children. However, the H-reflex was suppressed by vibration to the Achilles tendon similarly in both the idiopathic toe walkers and typically developing children. In conclusion, idiopathic toe walking in some children can be associated with functional alterations in their spinal motor circuits.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29664850": " Children with idiopathic toe-walking, a common pediatric condition, walk some or all of the time on their toes. This condition often causes parental concern, with repeated medical contacts and a range of interventions including stretching, casts, injection of botulinum toxin A, and surgical procedures. The purpose of this cohort study was to document the natural history of this condition. In a population-based cohort of 1,401 healthy 5.5-year-old Swedish children, we found the prevalence of idiopathic toe-walking to be approximately 5% (63 of 1,401). Of the 63 children who had ever been a toe-walker, 26 still were at the age of 5.5 years and were followed in the current study at 8 and 10 years of age. At the 8-year follow-up, parents were asked by telephone whether their child had received any treatment or diagnosis since the 5.5-year assessment, as well as to what extent (approximately 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the time) the child still walked on the toes. At the visit when the children were 10 years of age, their parents were asked the same questions. All 26 children also underwent a neurological examination and an orthopaedic examination focusing on the lower extremities. At 8 years of age, 6 of 26 children had ceased toe-walking, and by the age of 10 years, 50 (79%) of the original 63 patients had spontaneously ceased toe-walking. Idiopathic toe-walking did not result in contractures of the triceps surae. One subgroup of children displayed early contracture of the ankle and should thus not be considered idiopathic toe-walkers. Four of the children who still toe-walked at the age of 10 years demonstrated some neurodevelopmental comorbidity. By the age of 10 years, 79% of the children who have ever been a toe-walker spontaneously develop a typical gait, without intervention or contractures of the ankle dorsiflexion. The diagnosis of short tendo Achilles should be retained as a separate diagnosis as there is a subset of children with this entity who should be treated early in childhood. Neurodevelopmental comorbidities are common among those who continue to toe-walk. Prognostic Level I. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",

Treatment for toe walking includes physical therapy, orthotics, casting, Botulinum Toxin A injection into gastrocnemius/soleus muscles, and/or surgery; yet, little evidence exists regarding long-term treatment effects. The objective of this study was to explore the differences in longer-term gait outcomes and severity of idiopathic toe walking between children treated actively with casting or inactively following recommendations for stretching. Forty-three adolescents and young adults (14.3-28.8 years; 21 females, 22 males) who had participated in an idiopathic toe walking classification study as children, returned for repeat physical examination and three-dimensional computerized gait analysis (13.4 years follow-up, range 9.4-17.8 years); 23 participants had received active treatment with casting and ankle foot orthotics \u00b1 Botulinum Toxin A injection as children and 20 participants had received inactive treatment with recommended stretching exercises. Gait analysis data were compared retrospectively from baseline to follow-up using analysis of variance; toe walking severity was compared using a Wilcoxin Signed-Rank Sums test. Ankle angle at initial contact, peak dorsiflexion in stance, and toe walking severity improved significantly in the active treatment group only at follow-up. Significant improvement in peak ankle power and timing of ankle kinematics and kinetics in the gait cycle were found in both groups; however, greater changes occurred in the active treatment group. Both groups showed significantly improved internal plantar flexor moments, whereas knee extension increased in stance and passive ankle dorsiflexion decreased in both groups at follow-up (p = 0.001). Intermittent toe walking was reported in 49% (21/43) of participants at follow-up. The results of this study suggest that improvement in ankle kinematic timing and ankle kinetic gait analysis variables is sustainable, independent of conservative treatment for idiopathic toe walking in childhood.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587271": " Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is an exclusionary diagnosis given to healthy children who persist in walking on their toes after they should typically have achieved a heel-toe gait. The literature discusses conservative and surgical interventions using a variety of treatment modalities. Young children and children without a limitation in ankle dorsiflexion (the upwards movement of the foot towards the shin of the leg) are commonly treated with conservative interventions. Older children who continue toe walking and present with limitations in ankle dorsiflexion are sometimes treated with surgical procedures. This systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence for any intervention for the treatment of ITW. The conclusions of this review may support decision making by clinicians caring for children with ITW. It may also assist families when deciding on treatment options for their children with ITW. Many of the treatments employed have financial implications for parents or healthcare services. This review also aims to highlight any deficits in the current research base. To assess the effects of conservative and surgical interventions in children with ITW, specifically effects on gait normalisation, ankle range of motion, pain, frequency of recurrence, and any adverse effects. On 29 April 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PEDro. We searched the following registers of clinical trials for ongoing and recently completed trials: the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, apps.who.int/trialsearch), and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov). We searched conference proceedings and other grey literature in the BIOSIS databases and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey, opengrey.eu). We searched guidelines via the Turning Research Into Practice database (TRIP, tripdatabase.com) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (guideline.gov). We did not apply language restrictions. We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials for inclusion in the review if they involved participants diagnosed with ITW gait in the absence of a medical condition known to cause toe walking, or associated with toe walking. As there is no universally accepted age group for ITW, this review includes ITW at any age, who have been toe walking for more than six months, who can or cannot walk with a heel-toe gait, and who may or may not have limited dorsiflexion of the ankle joint. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was improvement in toe walking (defined as greater than 50% of time spent heel-toe walking). Secondary outcomes were active and passive range of motion of the ankle joint, pain, recurrence of ITW after treatment, and adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework. Four studies, comprising 104 participants, met the inclusion criteria. One study did not report data within the appropriate follow-up timeframe and data from two studies were insufficient for analysis. The single study from which we extracted data had 47 participants and was a randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Sweden. It tested the hypothesis that combined treatment with serial casting and botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was more effective than serial casting alone in reducing ITW gait.This study found that more participants treated with BTX improved (defined as toe walking less than 50% of the time, as reported by parents) (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 2.55; 1 trial, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference between groups in passive ankle joint dorsiflexion range of movement on the right with the knee extended (mean difference (MD) -1.48\u00ba, 95% CI -4.13 to 1.16; 1 trial, 47 participants), on the right with the knee flexed (MD -0.04\u00ba, 95% CI -1.80 to 1.73; 1 trial, 46 participants), on the left with the knee flexed (MD 1.07, 95% CI -1.22 to 3.37), or on the left with the knee extended (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.91). Nor was there a clear difference between the groups in recurrence of toe-walking gait (assessed via severity of toe walking (graded 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe)) on gait analysis, analysed as continuous data: MD 0.34 points, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.78; 46 participants). In principle, MDs greater than zero (i.e.) positive values) would favour BTX and casting and negative values would favour casting alone. We have not reported effects as better or worse because all results were from evidence of very low certainty. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations (outcome assessment was not blinded) and imprecision. Outcomes of pain and active range of motion were not reported in the included study.In terms of adverse events, calf pain was reported twice in the casting-only group and three times in the BTX group. There were three minor skin problems in each group and one reported case of pain directly after BTX injection. The report did not state if calf pain and skin irritation were from the same or different participants. The study authors reported that adverse events did not alter treatment adherence. The certainty of evidence from one study, which compared serial casting with serial casting with BTX for ITW in children, was too low for conclusions to be drawn. A further three studies reported outcomes relating to BTX, footwear, exercises, and different types of orthoses as interventions, however the outcome data were too limited to assess their effects.",

It is a common variation of normal gait development in children. Persistent toe walking past 2-3 years of age warrants further evaluation as toe walking can be associated with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and autism spectrum disorders. The diagnosis of idiopathic toe walking is a diagnosis of exclusion used for children with persistent toe walking and no associated medical condition. Despite variable pathophysiology, the treatment of toe walking has similarities across diagnoses as it is focused on the maintenance of range of motion through the ankle.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18432151": "Idiopathic toe-walking is a diagnosis of exclusion when a child presents with bilateral toe-to-toe gait. Although toe-walking is considered part of the normal gait spectrum in development, it is abnormal when persisting past the age of two. Toe-walking may be caused by cerebral palsy, congenital contracture of the Achilles tendon or paralytic muscular disorders such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Idiopathic toe-walking may be associated with developmental disorders such as autism or other myopathic or neuropathic disorders. The majority of disorders causing toe-walking can be ruled out through the history and physical examination, resulting in a diagnosis of idiopathic toe-walking. However, it may be difficult to differentiate mild forms of cerebral palsy, specifically mild spastic diplegia, and idiopathic toe-walking. The treatment options for idiopathic toe-walking include observation, conservative methods and surgical methods. Most children can be treated in the primary care setting with either observation or conservative treatment. Patients with severe contracture of the Achilles tendon, or persistent toe-walking, may need surgical intervention. The prognosis of idiopathic toe-walking is favorable with both conservative and surgical treatment allowing children to attain normal function and range of plantarflexion. The following article provides an overview of the background information, differential diagnosis and treatment options for idiopathic toe-walking.",

A classification for idiopathic toe walking would be helpful to better understand the condition, delineate true idiopathic toe walkers from patients with other conditions, and allow for assignment of a severity gradation, thereby directing management of ITW. The purpose of this study was to describe idiopathic toe walking and develop a toe walking classification scheme in a large sample of children. Three primary criteria, presence of a first ankle rocker, presence of an early third ankle rocker, and predominant early ankle moment, were used to classify idiopathic toe walking into three severity groups: Type 1 mild; Type 2 moderate; and Type 3 severe. Supporting data, based on ankle range of motion, sagittal joint powers, knee kinematics, and EMG data were also analyzed. Prospectively collected gait analysis data of 133 children (266 feet) with idiopathic toe walking were analyzed. Subjects' age range was from 4.19 to 15.96 years with a mean age of 8.80 years. Pooling right and left foot data, 40 feet were classified as Type 1, 129 were classified as Type 2, and 90 were classified as Type 3. Seven feet were unclassifiable. Statistical analysis of continuous variables comprising the primary criteria showed that the toe walking severity classification was able to differentiate between three levels of toe walking severity. This classification allowed for the quantitative description of the idiopathic toe walking pattern as well as the delineation of three distinct types of ITW patients (mild, moderate, and severe).",

Patients underwent full history, neurological examination and assessment of ankle dorsiflexion, followed by below-knee weight-bearing casting. Forty four developmentally normal children with no delay in walking age were in this study. There was an age range on presentation from 2 years to 14 years 4 months, with median 60.5 months. Sixty eight percent were male. Thirty four percent had a family history of the condition. Following casting, 66% of patients had improved gait on patient and clinician determined outcomes, with the majority of children ceasing to toe-walk.

First efficacy results of the nicotine vaccine 3'-AmNic-rEPA (NicVAX) showed that only a subgroup of the top 30% antibody responders achieved higher abstinence rates than placebo. The present study examined the efficacy of adding NicVAX versus placebo to varenicline and behavioural support as an aid in smoking cessation and relapse prevention. Randomized placebo-controlled trial. Two research centres (Maastricht University Medical Centre and Slotervaart Hospital) in the Netherlands. A total of 558 smokers were assigned randomly to six injections with NicVAX (n = 278) or placebo (n = 280) both co-administered with open label varenicline and behavioural support. Outcomes were prolonged carbon monoxide-validated abstinence from weeks 9 to 52 (primary) and weeks 37 to 52 (secondary). We also performed a pre-planned subgroup analysis in the top 30% antibody responders. There was no difference in abstinence rates between NicVAX and placebo from weeks 9 to 52 [27.7 versus 30.0%, odds ratio (OR) = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.62-1.29] or weeks 37 to 52 (33.8 versus 33.2%, OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.73-1.46).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23496672": "Most smokers are aware of the dangers of smoking and want to quit, yet few are successful owing to the highly addictive properties of nicotine. Available smoking cessation tools include pharmacotherapies that act in the CNS and show modest long-term efficacy. Additionally, there are emerging concerns that they may cause adverse neuropsychiatric events. Antinicotine vaccines have been used experimentally as aids to smoking cessation. It is hypothesized that antibody capture of nicotine in the bloodstream would prevent it from crossing the blood-brain barrier and reaching the nicotinic receptors. The advantage of the approach includes the relatively gradual rise of antibody levels, which may reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and the possible persistence of the antibodies potentially provides long-term protection, possibly preventing relapse. Proof-of-concept studies of at least two vaccine candidates have shown correlations between antinicotine antibody exposure and smoking abstinence. Unfortunately, the only vaccine tested in two large, randomized Phase III trials, 3'-amino-methyl-nicotine r-exoprotein A conjugate vaccine (NicVAX(\u00ae), Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, MD, USA), did not demonstrate efficacy. However, despite the lack of efficacy, there is good reason for continued optimism. This review will summarize the current status of the development of nicotine vaccines, discuss possible causes for the mixed results and review future scientific directions.",

The aims of this review are to assess the efficacy of nicotine vaccines for smoking cessation and for relapse prevention, and to assess the frequency and type of adverse events associated with the use of nicotine vaccines. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialised register for trials, using the term 'vaccine' in the title or abstract, or in a keyword (date of most recent search April 2012). To identify any other material including reviews and papers potentially relevant to the background or discussion sections, we also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, combining terms for nicotine vaccines with terms for smoking and tobacco use, without design limits or limits for human subjects. We searched the Annual Meeting abstracts of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco up to 2012, using the search string 'vaccin'. We searched Google Scholar for 'nicotine vaccine'. We also searched company websites and Google for information related to specific vaccines. We searched clinicaltrials.gov in March 2012 for 'nicotine vaccine' and for the trade names of known vaccine candidates. We included randomized controlled trials of nicotine vaccines, at Phase II and Phase III trial stage and beyond, in adult smokers or recent ex-smokers. We included studies of nicotine vaccines used as part of smoking cessation or relapse prevention interventions. We extracted data on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and personnel, reporting of outcomes, and completeness of follow-up.Our primary outcome measure was a minimum of six months abstinence from smoking. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred cessation rates at 12 months and biochemically validated rates where available. We have used the risk ratio (RR) to summarize individual trial outcomes. We have not pooled the current group of included studies as they cover different vaccines and variable regimens. There are no nicotine vaccines currently licensed for public use, but there are a number in development. We found four trials which met our inclusion criteria, three comparing NicVAX to placebo and one comparing NIC002 (formerly NicQbeta) to placebo. All were smoking cessation trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies as part of the drug development process, and all trials were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, 2642 smokers participated in the included studies in this review. None of the four included studies detected a statistically significant difference in long-term cessation between participants receiving vaccine and those receiving placebo. The RR for 12 month cessation in active and placebo groups was 1.35 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.82 to 2.22) in the trial of NIC002 and 1.74 (95% CI 0.73 to 4.18) in one NicVAX trial. Two Phase III NicVAX trials, for which full results were not available, reported similar quit rates of approximately 11% in both groups. In the two studies with full results available, post hoc analyses detected higher cessation rates in participants with higher levels of nicotine antibodies, but these findings are not readily generalisable. The two studies with full results showed nicotine vaccines to be well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. In the study of NIC002, participants receiving the vaccine were more likely to report mild to moderate adverse events, most commonly flu-like symptoms, whereas in the study of NicVAX there was no significant difference between the two arms. Information on adverse events was not available for the large Phase III trials of NicVAX.Vaccine candidates are likely to undergo significant changes before becoming available to the general public, and those included in this review may not be the first to reach market; this limits the external validity of the results reported in this review in terms of both effectiveness and tolerability. There is currently no evidence that nicotine vaccines enhance long-term smoking cessation. Rates of serious adverse events recorded in the two trials with full data available were low, and the majority of adverse events reported were at mild to moderate levels. The evidence available suggests nicotine vaccines do not induce compensatory smoking or affect withdrawal symptoms. No nicotine vaccines are currently licensed for use in any country but a number are under development.Further trials of nicotine vaccines are needed, comparing vaccines with placebo for smoking cessation. Further trials are also needed to explore the potential of nicotine vaccines to prevent relapse. Results from past, current and future research should be reported in full. Adverse events and serious adverse events should continue to be carefully monitored and thoroughly reported.",

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (N = 301 smokers) tested the results of 200- and 400-\u00b5g doses administered four or five times over a period of 6 months, as compared with placebo. 3'AmNic-rEPA recipients with the highest serum antinicotine Ab response (top 30% by area under the curve (AUC)) were significantly more likely than the placebo recipients (24.6% vs. 12.0%, P = 0.024, odds ratio (OR) = 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-6.37) to attain 8 weeks of continuous abstinence from weeks 19 through 26. The five-injection, 400-\u00b5g dose regimen elicited the greatest Ab response and resulted in significantly higher abstinence rates than placebo.

Current smoking cessation rates using behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapeutic interventions have had modest success, with \u223c1:5 smokers remaining abstinent long-term. Nicotine vaccines are a new class of immunotherapeutics under development. It is believed that anti-nicotine antibodies arising from vaccination capture nicotine and prevent or reduce its entry into the brain, as the antibody-bound nicotine is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. This in turn decreases the pleasurable effects of smoking, reducing or eliminating positive reinforcement, thereby making it easier for a smoker to quit smoking. Four vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical testing with mixed success. Proof-of-concept has been established in that individuals with higher levels of anti-nicotine antibodies were observed to have higher smoking cessation and abstinence rates. Recently, the most advanced candidate vaccine, NicVAX, failed to meet the primary endpoint in two large phase III studies, although the correlation of higher abstinence rates in subjects with higher immunity to nicotine was observed. Although the field has had setbacks, the magnitude of the tobacco epidemic and the positive pre-clinical research and observed clinical trends indicate continued research is warranted. Several avenues are being actively pursued: a) improving vaccine potency by introducing novel carriers and/or adjuvants to stimulate higher immune response b) targeting subjects who have a robust response (e.g. personalized medicine) c) combining vaccines with pharmacotherapy for maintenance of abstinence/relapse prevention.",

We sought to assess whether natalizumab slows disease progression in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, independent of relapses. ASCEND was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (part 1) with an optional 2 year open-label extension (part 2). Enrolled patients aged 18-58 years were natalizumab-naive and had secondary progressive multiple sclerosis for 2 years or more, disability progression unrelated to relapses in the previous year, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 3\u00b70-6\u00b75. In part 1, patients from 163 sites in 17 countries were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 300 mg intravenous natalizumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 2 years. Patients were stratified by site and by EDSS score (3\u00b70-5\u00b75 vs 6\u00b70-6\u00b75). Patients completing part 1 could enrol in part 2, in which all patients received natalizumab every 4 weeks until the end of the study. Throughout both parts, patients and staff were masked to the treatment received in part 1. The primary outcome in part 1 was the proportion of patients with sustained disability progression, assessed by one or more of three measures: the EDSS, Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), and 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). The primary outcome in part 2 was the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.

In part 1, 195 (44%) of 439 natalizumab-treated patients and 214 (48%) of 448 placebo-treated patients had confirmed disability progression (odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b786; 95% CI 0\u00b766-1\u00b713; p=0\u00b7287). No treatment effect was observed on the EDSS (OR 1\u00b706, 95% CI 0\u00b774-1\u00b753; nominal p=0\u00b7753) or the T25FW (0\u00b798, 0\u00b774-1\u00b730; nominal p=0\u00b7914) components of the primary outcome. However, natalizumab treatment reduced 9HPT progression (OR 0\u00b756, 95% CI 0\u00b740-0\u00b780; nominal p=0\u00b7001). In part 1, 100 (22%) placebo-treated and 90 (20%) natalizumab-treated patients had serious adverse events. In part 2, 291 natalizumab-continuing patients and 274 natalizumab-naive patients received natalizumab (median follow-up 160 weeks [range 108-221]). Serious adverse events occurred in 39 (13%) patients continuing natalizumab and in 24 (9%) patients initiating natalizumab. Two deaths occurred in part 1, neither of which was considered related to study treatment. No progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurred. Natalizumab treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis did not reduce progression on the primary multicomponent disability endpoint in part 1, but it did reduce progression on its upper-limb component. Longer-term trials are needed to assess whether treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis might produce benefits on additional disability components. Biogen.",

Patients most often present with a relapsing-remitting disease course, typically progressing over time to a phase of relentless advancement in secondary progressive MS (SPMS), for which approved disease-modifying therapies are limited. In this review, we summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of SPMS and the rationale and clinical potential for natalizumab, which is currently approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to exert beneficial effects in reducing disease progression unrelated to relapses in SPMS. In both forms of MS, active brain-tissue injury is associated with inflammation; but in SPMS, the inflammatory response occurs at least partly behind the blood-brain barrier and is followed by a cascade of events, including persistent microglial activation that may lead to chronic demyelination and neurodegeneration associated with irreversible disability. In patients with relapsing forms of MS, natalizumab therapy is known to significantly reduce intrathecal inflammatory responses which results in reductions in brain lesions and brain atrophy as well as beneficial effects on clinical measures, such as reduced frequency and severity of relapse and reduced accumulation of disability. Natalizumab treatment also reduces levels of cerebrospinal fluid chemokines and other biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation, axonal damage and demyelination, and has demonstrated the ability to reduce innate immune activation and intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis in patients with MS. The efficacy of natalizumab therapy in SPMS is currently being investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",

Risk stratification on the basis of immunosuppressant exposure, natalizumab treatment duration and anti-John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody status and index has greatly improved clinical decision making. Other potential serious natalizumab-associated risks reported in clinical trials and postmarketing settings include infusion reactions, hepatotoxicity and rare, serious opportunistic infections. With more than a decade of continuous postmarketing experience, natalizumab remains a very effective option for patients with relapsing forms of MS. To optimize appropriate selection of natalizumab for patients with relapsing MS, however, a thorough understanding of individual patient risk factors for PML or other adverse events is also required.",

Cell cycle reactivation is considered an important neuropathological feature of AD, and re-expression and activation of cell cycle regulators are known to occur in neurons containing NFTs. The aim of the present study was to investigate cell cycle reactivation during tau hyperphosphorylation in primary hippocampal neurons. We used forskolin, a specific activator of PKA, to induce tau hyperphosphorylation in cultured primary hippocampal neurons, and then measured levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1. We found that forskolin induced hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser214, Ser396, and Ser202/Thr205 sites, attaining peak levels at 6, 12, and 12 h, respectively, while returning to normal levels at 24 h. Forskolin also induced a sustained cAMP elevation and PKA activation, which peaked at 6 h, in association with activation and overexpression of protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) at 24 h. The tau hyperphosphorylation was accompanied by increases in cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 levels; immunostaining showed overlapping distribution of hyperphosphorylated tau and cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 in primary hippocampal neurons. Forskolin induced hyperphosphorylation of tau and increased cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 protein levels in HEK293/tau441 cells, but not in the HEK293/vector cells, whereas the PKA inhibitor H89 inhibited the effects of forskolin on tau hyperphosphorylation and cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 protein levels. These findings suggest that forskolin induces tau hyperphosphorylation, which is itself necessary for the subsequent increases of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 levels.",

Despite extensive research on the mechanisms of disease development and progression, the exact mechanism is not elucidated yet, which has hampered drug development and subsequent treatment of the disease. We have recently shown that the serum levels of arsenic and malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker, are high in MS patients. In this article, we would like to formulate the hypothesis that arsenic may cause MS by induction of inflammation, degeneration, and apoptosis in neuronal cells. The induction of ROS generation in cells upon exposure to arsenic as a heavy metal may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Tau protein, a member of the family of microtubule-associated proteins, is mainly expressed in neurons and contribute to the assembly of neuronal microtubules network. Arsenic may affect the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau proteins and may be involved in the cascade leading to deregulation of tau function associated with neurodegeneration. For validation of this hypothesis, studies might be conducted to evaluate the association of arsenic levels and tau protein levels in MS patients. Further studies might also focus on the trafficking along microtubules in neurons of MS patient with regard to hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. This hypothesis may add a new dimension to the understanding of MS etiology and help to design novel therapeutic agents against potential targets that might be discovered. If this hypothesis proves to be true, tau phosphorylation inhibitors can be potential candidates for MS drug development.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29441009": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive abilities and formation of senile plaques, composed mainly of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein, in the hippocampus and cortex of afflicted humans. In brains of AD patients the metabolism of A\u03b2 is dysregulated, which leads to the accumulation and aggregation of A\u03b2. Metabolism of A\u03b2 and tau proteins is crucially influenced by autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent, homeostatic process, in which organelles and proteins are degraded and recycled into energy. Thus, dysfunction of autophagy is suggested to lead to the accretion of noxious proteins in the AD brain. In the present review, we describe the process of autophagy and its importance in AD. Additionally, we discuss mechanisms and genes linking autophagy and AD, i.e., the mTOR pathway, neuroinflammation, endocannabinoid system, <i>ATG7, BCL2, BECN1, CDK5, CLU, CTSD, FOXO1, GFAP, ITPR1, MAPT, PSEN1, SNCA, UBQLN1</i>, and <i>UCHL1</i>. We also present pharmacological agents acting via modulation of autophagy that may show promise in AD therapy.

Our previous work established that amyloidogenic peptides from the small heat shock protein \u03b1B crystallin (HspB5) and from amyloid \u03b2 fibrils, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, were therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reflecting aspects of the pathology of MS. To understand the molecular basis for the therapeutic effect, we showed a set of amyloidogenic peptides composed of six amino acids, including those from tau, amyloid \u03b2 A4, major prion protein (PrP), HspB5, amylin, serum amyloid P, and insulin B chain, to be anti-inflammatory and capable of reducing serological levels of interleukin-6 and attenuating paralysis in EAE. The chaperone function of the fibrils correlates with the therapeutic outcome. Fibrils composed of tau 623-628 precipitated 49 plasma proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100, clusterin, transthyretin, and complement C3, supporting the hypothesis that the fibrils are active biological agents. Amyloid fibrils thus may provide benefit in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders.",

Neurodegeneration observed in these diseases is linked to neuronal fibrillary hyperphosphorylated tau protein inclusions. Transglutaminases (TGs) are inducible enzymes, capable of modifying conformational and/or structural properties of proteins by inducing molecular cross-links. Both transglutaminase 1 (TG1) and transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are abundantly expressed in the brain and are associated with fibrillary hyperphosphorylated tau protein inclusions in neurons of AD, so-called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, other data obtained by our group suggested that tau pathology in the brain may be primarily related to TG1 and not to TG2 activity. To obtain more information on this issue, we set out to investigate the association of TG1, TG2, and TG-catalysed cross-links with fibrillary hyperphosphorylated tau inclusions in tauopathies other than AD, using immunohistochemistry. We found strong TG1 and TG-catalysed cross-link staining in neuronal tau inclusions characteristic of PSP, FTDP-17 with mutations in the tau gene (FTDP-17T), and PiD brain, whereas, in contrast to AD, TG2 was only rarely observed in these inclusions. Furthermore, using a biochemical approach, we demonstrated that tau is a substrate for TG1-mediated cross-linking. Interestingly, we found co-localization of the TG1 activator, tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG3), in the neuronal tau inclusions of PSP, FTDP-17T, and PiD, but not in NFTs of AD cases, indicating that these tau-containing protein aggregates are not identical. We conclude that TG1-catalysed cross-linking, regulated by TIG3, might play an important role in the formation of neuronal tau inclusions in PSP, FTDP-17T, and PiD brain.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20678581": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein linked with neurodegenerative diseases. Humans express six different isoforms of tau; the longest containing four microtubule-binding repeat motifs in the C-terminal that are vital for what is considered the major biological function of tau, to stabilize microtubules and facilitate axonal transport. The capacity of tau to maintain its normal biological function is dependent upon its phosphorylation state. In Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, there is a hyperphosphorylation of tau that leads to the intracellular accumulation of tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. While the role of tau in Parkinson's disease has been understated for some time, here we summarize key genetic, pathological and biochemical evidence supporting a role for tau in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Toxic interactions with alpha synuclein may lead to hyperphosphorylation of tau and eventually to the deposition of both proteins in the disease.",

In this randomized, multicenter study, 1939 healthy infants were immunized at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with 1 of 3 lots of DTaP(5) coadministered with IPV and Hib vaccines or 1 lot of DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib combination vaccine. Subsequently, 849 of these study participants were given a fourth dose of DTaP(5) and Hib vaccines or a fourth dose of DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib at 1 to 16 months of age. Safety was monitored throughout the study, and blood specimens were obtained to assess antibody responses. DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib elicited similar or fewer solicited injection-site and systemic reactions as compared with the separate administration of US-licensed DTaP(5), IPV, and Hib vaccines. Seroresponse and seroprotection rates elicited by DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib were noninferior to US-licensed equivalent vaccines after the infant series and after the fourth dose. Children immunized with DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib had higher antibody geometric mean concentrations to pertussis toxoid and filamentous hemagglutinin; children immunized with the separate vaccines had higher responses to pertactin. Hib antibody responses to Hib polysaccharide were nearly identical in the DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib and separate-vaccine groups. Persistence of antibodies to the fifth (preschool) dose was also similar between groups. DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib combination vaccine was shown to be immunogenic and well tolerated. No clinically important differences in the safety or immunologic profiles were noted for DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib versus the separately administered, US-licensed equivalent vaccines. DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib is a suitable replacement for separately administered DTaP, IPV, and Hib vaccines.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944315": "There is a long standing perception that AhR ligands are automatically disqualified from pharmaceutical development due to their induction of Cyp1a1 as well as their potential for causing \"dioxin-like\" toxicities. However, recent discoveries of new AhR ligands with potential therapeutic applications have been reported, inviting reconsideration of this policy. One area of exploration is focused on the activation of AhR to promote the generation of regulatory T cells, which control the intensity and duration of immune responses. Rapidly metabolized AhR ligands (RMAhRLs), which do not bioaccumulate in the same manner as 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have been discovered that induce Tregs and display impressive therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of preclinical models of immune-mediated diseases. Given the promise of these RMAhRLs, is the bias against AhR activators still valid? Can RMAhRLs be given chronically to maintain therapeutic levels of AhR activation without producing the same toxicity profile as dioxin-like compounds? Based on our review of the data, there is little evidence to support the indiscriminate exclusion of AhR activators/Cyp1a1 inducers from early drug developmental pipelines. We also found no evidence that short-term treatment with RMAhRLs produce \"dioxin-like toxicity\" and, in fact, were well tolerated. However, safety testing of individual RMAhRLs under therapeutic conditions, as performed with all promising new drugs, will be needed to reveal whether or not chronic activation of AhR leads to unacceptable adverse outcomes.",

As a result, induction of Cyp1a1 by pharmaceutical drug candidates or environmental contaminants raises significant concern in risk assessment. The current study evaluates the specificity of Cyp1a1 induction as a marker for AhR affinity and activation and provides context to assess the relevancy of AhR activation to risk assessment. In vivo experiments examined the expression of Cyp1a1 and other AhR-regulated genes in liver, kidney, and heart in response to 596 compounds. From this data set, a subset of 147 compounds was then evaluated for their ability to activate or bind to the AhR using a combination of gel shift, reporter gene, and competitive receptor binding assays. Whereas in vivo Cyp1a1 mRNA expression is a sensitive marker for AhR activation, it lacks specificity, because 81 (59%) of 137 compounds were found to significantly induce Cyp1a1 in vivo but were not verified to bind or activate the AhR in vitro. Combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine AhR agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including leflunomide, flutamide, and nimodipine. These drugs do not produce dioxin-like toxicity in rats or in humans. These data demonstrate that induction of Cyp1a1 is a nonspecific biomarker of direct AhR affinity and activation and lend further support to the hypothesis that Cyp1a1 induction and/or AhR activation is not synonymous with dioxin-like toxicity.",

One of them, the yeast U6 snRNA (SNR6) gene is activated in vitro by a positioned nucleosome between its intragenic box A and extragenic, downstream box B separated by approximately 200 bp. We demonstrate here that the in vivo chromatin structure of the gene region is characterized by the presence of an array of positioned nucleosomes, with only one of them in the 5' end of the gene having a regulatory role. A positioned nucleosome present between boxes A and B in vivo does not move when the gene is repressed due to nutritional deprivation. In contrast, the upstream nucleosome which covers the TATA box under repressed conditions is shifted approximately 50 bp further upstream by the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler RSC upon activation. It is marked with the histone variant H2A.Z and H4K16 acetylation in active state. In the absence of H2A.Z, the chromatin structure of the gene does not change, suggesting that H2A.Z is not required for establishing the active chromatin structure. These results show that the chromatin structure directly participates in regulation of a Pol III-transcribed gene under different states of its activity in vivo.",

In RSC-depleted cells, NFRs shrink such that the average positions of flanking nucleosomes move toward predicted sites. Nucleosome positioning at distinct subsets of promoters additionally requires the essential Myb family proteins Abf1 and Reb1, whose binding sites are enriched in NFRs. In contrast, H2A.Z deposition is dispensable for nucleosome positioning. By regulating H2A.Z deposition using a steroid-inducible protein splicing strategy, we show that NFR establishment is necessary for H2A.Z deposition.

Histone variant incorporation, histone post-translational modifications, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling are three major strategies for chromatin manipulation, and are relatively well characterized in transcriptional regulation. Emerging lines of evidence indicate that histone variants (H2AX and H2A.Z), histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination) and chromatin-remodeling complexes (INO80, SWR1, SWI/SNF, RSC and NuRD) are important and direct players in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response as well.

We report here H2A.Z-chaperone activity of the yeast FACT complex on the short, nucleosome-free, non-coding, pol III-transcribed yeast tRNA genes. On a prototype gene, yeast SUP4, chromatin remodeler RSC and FACT regulate its transcription through novel mechanisms, wherein the two gene-flanking nucleosomes containing H2A.Z, play different roles. Nhp6, which ensures transcription fidelity and helps load yFACT onto the gene flanking nucleosomes, has inhibitory role. RSC maintains a nucleosome abutting the gene terminator downstream, which results in reduced transcription rate in active state while H2A.Z probably helps RSC in keeping the gene nucleosome-free and serves as stress-sensor. All these factors maintain an epigenetic state which allows the gene to return quickly from repressed to active state and tones down the expression from the active SUP4 gene, required probably to maintain the balance in cellular tRNA pool.",

The p38-related Hog1 SAPK is an important regulator of transcription that mediates chromatin remodeling upon stress. Hog1 targets the RSC chromatin remodeling complex to stress-responsive genes and rsc deficient cells display reduced induction of gene expression. Here we show that the absence of H3K4 methylation, either achieved by deletion of the SET1 methyltransferase or by amino acid substitution of H3K4, bypasses the requirement of RSC for stress-responsive gene expression. Monomethylation of H3K4 is specifically inhibiting RSC-independent chromatin remodeling and thus, it prevents osmostress-induced gene expression. The absence of H3K4 monomethylation permits that the association of alternative remodelers with stress-responsive genes and the Swr1 complex (SWR-C) is instrumental in the induction of gene expression upon stress. Accordingly, the absence of SWR-C or histone H2A.Z results in compromised chromatin remodeling and impaired gene expression in the absence of RSC and H3K4 methylation. These results indicate that expression of stress-responsive genes is controlled by two remodeling mechanisms: RSC in the presence of monomethylated H3K4, and SWR-C in the absence of H3K4 monomethylation. Our findings point to a novel role for H3K4 monomethylation in dictating the specificity of chromatin remodeling, adding an extra layer of regulation to the transcriptional stress response.",

The microcapsules were prepared by spray drying technique using Eudragit L100-55, and the yield was more than 80%. The particle size and surface morphology were determined by particle analyzer and scanning electron microscopy. Thermal characterization and infrared spectroscopy were evaluated as well. In vitro release assay found that more than 60% amifostine was released during the first 4h and the cumulative release ratio was up to approximately 90% in 24h at 37\u00b0C. The radioprotective efficacy was determined by 30-day survival study in mice acutely exposed to 6 Gy \u03b3-ray irradiation. The results showed that all dose groups of amifostine microcapsules could significantly improve survival animal numbers and time. Furthermore, tissue distribution studies indicated the concentrations of the active metabolite WR-1065 in mice tissues of microcapsule group were higher than that of oral amifostine group at 180 min (p&lt;0.01).

Though a large number of molecules have been studied for their radioprotective capability, no single agent is available today that meets all the requirements of a good radiprotector. In this study, we have investigated a combination of Resveratrol (RSV) and 3,3'-Diindolyl methane (DIM) for its efficacy for radioprotection. It is our hypothesis that this combination that possesses less toxicity than synthetic compounds, free radical scavenging potential, and the capacity to interfere with the several of the signaling cascades that trigger damage to cell by ionizing radiation may possess good radioprotective capability. Mice were pre-treated with a combination of RSV and DIM and the 30-day mortality assay, endogenous antioxidant levels in intestinal mucosa, metaphase chromosomal aberrations, and micronuclei formation were assessed after exposed to ionizing radiation. The dose modifying factor (DRF) obtained for RSV, DIM, and the combination is 1.15, 1.17, and 1.3, respectively. Pre-treatment of mice with the combination results in significant (***p = .001) protection of the endogenous antioxidant levels, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei formation, after exposure to ionizing radiation.

This search was further narrowed down to synthesis, bioavailability, CAPE derivatives, radioprotective and radiosensitizing effects of CAPE. This review focused on the differential radiomodulatory effects of CAPE in normal and cancer cells.

The goal of this study was to identify morphological changes in melanized and non-melanized CN cells following irradiation with densely-ionizing deuterons and alpha particles relative to sparsely-ionizing gamma radiation. We observed significant differences between the melanized and non-melanized CN cellular ultrastructure following irradiation. Melanized CN cells were relatively resistant to mid and max-dose levels of alpha particles and deuterons irradiation. Following irradiation the capsule was stripped, but the cell wall was intact and structural integrity was maintained. At the maximum dose, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and mitochondrial swelling started to occur. In contrast, the non-melanized CN strain was sensitive to the mid-dose radiation. Non-melanized cells presented two morphologies: small condensed, and swollen, lacking structural integrity.

Despite its beneficial therapeutic effects on tumor cells, exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) is associated with several side effects. Although improvements in radiotherapy techniques and instruments could reduce these side effects, there are still important concerns for cancer patients. For several years, scientists have been trying to modulate tumor and normal tissue responses to IR, leading to an increase in therapeutic ratio. So far, several types of radioprotectors and radiosensitizers have been investigated in experimental studies. However, high toxicity of chemical sensitizers or possible tumor protection by radioprotectors creates a doubt for their clinical applications. On the other hand, the protective effects of these radioprotectors or sensitizer effects of radiosensitizers may limit some type of cancers. Hence, the development of some radioprotectors without any protective effect on tumor cells or low toxic radiosensitizers can help improve therapeutic ratio with less side effects. Melatonin as a natural body hormone is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that shows some anti-cancer properties. It is able to neutralize different types of free radicals produced by IR or pro-oxidant enzymes which are activated following exposure to IR and plays a key role in the protection of normal tissues. In addition, melatonin has shown the ability to inhibit long-term changes in inflammatory responses at different levels, thereby ameliorating late side effects of radiotherapy. Fortunately, in contrast to classic antioxidants, some in vitro studies have revealed that melatonin has a potent anti-tumor activity when used alongside irradiation. However, the mechanisms of its radiosensitive effect remain to be elucidated. Studies suggested that the activation of pro-apoptosis gene, such as p53, changes in the metabolism of tumor cells, suppression of DNA repair responses as well as changes in biosynthesis of estrogen in breast cancer cells are involved in this process. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms for radioprotection and radiosensitizer effects of melatonin. Furthermore, some other proposed mechanisms that may be involved are presented.",

Besides the beneficial roles of ionizing radiation, there are some concerns about accidental exposure to radioactive sources. The threat posed by its use in terrorism is of global concern. Furthermore, there are several side effects to normal organs for patients who had undergone radiation treatment for cancer. Hence, the modulation of radiation response in normal tissues was one of the most important aims of radiobiology. Although, so far, several agents have been investigated for protection and mitigation of radiation injury. Agents such as amifostine may lead to severe toxicity, while others may interfere with radiation therapy outcomes as a result of tumor protection. Metformin is a natural agent that is well known as an antidiabetic drug. It has shown some antioxidant effects and enhances DNA repair capacity, thereby ameliorating cell death following exposure to radiation. Moreover, through targeting endogenous ROS production within cells, it can mitigate radiation injury. This could potentially make it an effective radiation countermeasure. In contrast to other radioprotectors, metformin has shown modulatory effects through induction of several genes such as AMPK, which suppresses reduction/ oxidation (redox) reactions, protects cells from accumulation of unrepaired DNA, and attenuates initiation of inflammation as well as fibrotic pathways. Interestingly, these properties of metformin can sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy. In this article, we aimed to review the interesting properties of metformin such as radioprotection, radiomitigation and radiosensitization, which could make it an interesting adjuvant for clinical radiotherapy, as well as an interesting candidate for mitigation of radiation injury after a radiation disaster.",

Encapsulated TPs nanoparticles were spherical in size and promoted TPs stability in normal and gastrointestinal conditions without losing antioxidant activity.

However, radiation-induced damage to normal tissues restricts the therapeutic doses of radiation that can be delivered to tumours and thereby limits the effectiveness of the treatment. The use of radioprotectors represents an obvious strategy to obtain better tumour control using a higher dose in radiotherapy. However, most of the synthetic radioprotective compounds studied have shown inadequate clinical efficacy owing to their inherent toxicity and high cost. Hence, the development of radioprotective agents with lower toxicity and an extended window of protection has attracted a great deal of attention, and the identification of alternative agents that are less toxic and highly effective is an absolute necessity. Recent studies have shown that alpha-2-macroglobulin (\u03b12M) possesses radioprotective effects. \u03b12M is a tetrameric, disulfide-rich plasma glycoprotein that functions as a non-selective inhibitor of different types of non-specific proteases and as a carrier of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. \u03b12M induces protein factors whose interplay underlies radioprotection, which supports the idea that \u03b12M is the central effector of natural radioprotection in the rat. Pretreatment with \u03b12M has also induced a significant reduction of irradiation-induced DNA damage and the complete restoration of liver and body weight. Mihailovi\u0107 et al. concluded that the radioprotection provided by \u03b12M was in part mediated through cytoprotection of new blood cells produced in the bone marrow; these authors also indicated that an important aspect of the radioprotective effect of amifostine was the result of the induction of the endogenous cytoprotective capability of \u03b12M. The radioprotective effects of \u03b12M are possibly due to antioxidant, anti-fibrosis, and anti-inflammatory functions, as well as the maintenance of homeostasis, and enhancement of the DNA repair and cell recovery processes.

Subsequently, SATB1 was shown to repress many genes expressed in the thymus, including interleukin-2 receptor alpha, c-myc, and those encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a glucocorticoid-responsive retrovirus. SATB1 binds to MARs within the MMTV provirus to repress transcription. To address the role of the nuclear matrix in SATB1-mediated repression, a series of SATB1 deletion constructs was used to determine protein localization. Wild-type SATB1 localized to the soluble nuclear, chromatin, and nuclear matrix fractions. Mutants lacking amino acids 224-278 had a greatly diminished localization to the nuclear matrix, suggesting the presence of a nuclear matrix targeting sequence (NMTS). Transient transfection experiments showed that NMTS fusions to green fluorescent protein or LexA relocalized these proteins to the nuclear matrix. Difficulties with previous assay systems prompted us to develop retroviral vectors to assess effects of different SATB1 domains on expression of MMTV proviruses or integrated reporter genes. SATB1 overexpression repressed MMTV transcription in the presence and absence of functional glucocorticoid receptor. Repression was alleviated by deletion of the NMTS, which did not affect DNA binding, or by deletion of the MAR-binding domain. Our studies indicate that both nuclear matrix association and DNA binding are required for optimal SATB1-mediated repression of the integrated MMTV promoter and may allow insulation from cellular regulatory elements.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29388727": "The genome organizer special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) regulates specific functions through chromatin remodeling in T helper cells. It was recently reported by our team that T cells from SATB1 conditional knockout (SATB1cKO) mice, in which the Satb1 gene is deleted from hematopoietic cells, impair phosphorylation of signaling molecules in response to T cell receptor (TCR) crosslinking. However, in vivo T cell responses upon antigen presentation in the absence of SATB1 remain unclear. In the current study, it was shown that SATB1 modulates T cell antigen responses during the induction and effector phases. Expression of SATB1 was upregulated in response to TCR stimulation, suggesting that SATB1 is important for this antigen response. The role of SATB1 in TCR responses and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was therefore examined using the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 (MOG35-55) and pertussis toxin. SATB1cKO mice were found to be resistant to EAE and had defects in IL-17- and IFN-\u03b3-producing pathogenic T cells. Thus, SATB1 expression appears necessary for T cell function in the induction phase. To examine SATB1 function during the effector phase, a tamoxifen-inducible SATB1 deletion system, SATB1cKO-ER-Cre mice, was used. Encephalitogenic T cells from MOG35-55-immunized SATB1cKO-ER-Cre mice were transferred into healthy mice. Mice that received tamoxifen before the onset of paralysis were resistant to EAE. Furthermore, no disease progression occurred in recipient mice treated with tamoxifen after the onset of EAE. Thus, SATB1 is essential for maintaining TCR responsiveness during the induction and effector phases and may provide a novel therapeutic target for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.",

However, there is still no report about Satb1 functions in peripheral nerve injury until now. In this study, we explored the regulatory effect of Satb1 on Schwann cells. MTT assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry assay were respectively used to determine Schwann cell viability, migration, and apoptosis. The mRNA and phosphorylation levels of Satb1 and SHIP1 were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis, respectively. The correlation between Satb1 and SHIP1 was examined by ChIP assay. The expressions of PI3K/AKT pathway related factors were detected by Western blotting. In the present study, we found that knock-out of Satb1 significantly inhibited cell viability and migration, and promoted Schwann cells apoptosis. Conversely, over-expression of Satb1 promoted cell viability, migration, and inhibited apoptosis. Satb1 inhibited SHIP1 expression by recruiting HDAC1. Furthermore, results showed that Satb1 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by inhibiting the expression of SHIP1. SHIP1 showed significant reversal effects on the regulatory roles of Satb1 in Schwann cells. Over-expression of Satb1 and SHIP1 inhibited cell viability, migration, and promoted apoptosis. Our study demonstrated that the Satb1 knock-out could inhibit the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway by up-regulating SHIP1, thus inhibiting cell viability and migration, and promoting Schwann cell apoptosis.",

Liquid coating characterization of high concentration PTH(1-34) formulations (&gt;20% w/w) was assessed by viscosity and contact angle measurements along with RP-HPLC and SEC-HPLC. Solid-state coating morphology of PTH(1-34) on microprojection arrays was determined by SEM, and stability on storage was assessed after dissolution and testing with stability indicating assays. Internal vapor analysis was performed to detect and quantify volatile organics released by patch components into the headspace inside the final package. Aggregation and oxidation were the primary degradation mechanisms for solid-state PTH(1-34) in this transdermal delivery system. Although these two degradation pathways can be retarded by appropriate stabilizers and use of foil pouch packaging (nitrogen purged and desiccant), the solid-state drug formulation's compatibility with patch components, particularly the plastic retainer ring, surprisingly dictated PTH(1-34) stability. Internal vapor analysis demonstrated that PTH(1-34) was particularly vulnerable to vapors such as moisture, oxygen, and outgassed formaldehyde, and each of these volatiles played a unique and significant role in PTH(1-34)'s degradation mechanism. Identifying degradation mechanisms of volatile compounds on solid-state PTH(1-34) peptide stability allowed for the rationale for selection of final formulation, system components and packaging conditions. A &gt;2-yr, ambient temperature storage stability was demonstrated for solid-state drug coated on a novel transdermal microprojection delivery system. This system was successfully tested in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.",

Here we show signal-binding motifs in PAR1&amp;2 that are critical for breast cancer growth. This occurs via the association of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with Akt/PKB as a key signalling event of PARs. Other PH-domain signal-proteins such as Etk/Bmx and Vav3 also associate with PAR1 and PAR2 through their PH domains. PAR1 and PAR2 bind with priority to Etk/Bmx. A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not in R352A, abrogates PH-protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumour growth in vivo and placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro. Similarly, the PAR1 mutant hPar1-7A, which is unable to bind the PH domain, reduces mammary tumours and EVT invasion, endowing these motifs with physiological significance and underscoring the importance of these previously unknown PAR1 and PAR2 PH-domain-binding motifs in both pathological and physiological invasion processes.",

In addition to protection against a range of diseases, vaccines also have social and economic benefits. However, for vaccines to be effective, routine immunization programmes must be undertaken regularly to ensure individual and community protection. Nonetheless, in many countries in Africa, vaccination coverage is low because governments struggle to deliver vaccines to the most remote areas, thus contributing to constant outbreaks of various vaccine-preventable diseases. African governments fail to deliver vaccines to a significant percentage of the target population due to many issues in key areas such as policy setting, programme management and financing, supply chain, global vaccine market, research and development of vaccines. This review gives an overview of the causes of these issues and what is currently being done to address them. This review will discuss the role of philanthropic organisations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and global partnerships such as the global alliance for vaccines and immunizations in the development, purchase and delivery of vaccines.",

Contrary to what some have claimed, we argue that this individual moral obligation exists in spite of the fact that each individual vaccination does not significantly affect vaccination coverage rates and therefore does not significantly contribute to herd immunity. Establishing the existence of a moral obligation to be vaccinated (both for adults and for children) despite the negligible contribution each vaccination can make to the realisation of herd immunity is important because such moral obligation would strengthen the justification for coercive vaccination policies. We show that two types of arguments-namely a utilitarian argument based on Parfit's Principle of Group Beneficence and a contractualist argument-can ground an individual moral obligation to be vaccinated, in spite of the imperceptible contribution that any single vaccination makes to vaccine coverage rates. We add a further argument for a moral obligation to be vaccinated that does not require embracing problematic comprehensive moral theories such as utilitarianism or contractualism. The argument is based on a \"duty of easy rescue\" applied to collectives, which grounds a collective moral obligation to realise herd immunity, and on a principle of fairness in the distribution of the burdens that must be borne to realise herd immunity.",

This retrospective cohort study used data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry-the state immunization information system-for children born 2006-2010. Children aged 24 months as of December 31, 2012, were included. The proportion of children with timely administration of vaccine doses was calculated, and the mean days of vaccination delay with SD were reported. Among 620,592 Michigan children, 42.2% had received all vaccines, but only 13.2% were vaccinated on time by age 24 months. Children's vaccinations were delayed an average of 59.2 (SD=91.2) days by age 24 months for all recommended vaccine doses. Children who received a timely hepatitis B vaccine birth dose or who received a combination vaccine had less delay in vaccination. Michigan children have high vaccination coverage based on standard measures but few receive these vaccines on time. Promoting use of combination vaccines may improve parental compliance with timely vaccination of children.",

As we enter a new era, with the first routine program underway to control endemic group B meningococcal disease for infants in the UK, it is timely to review the key landmarks in group B vaccine development, and discuss the issues determining whether control of endemic group B disease will be achieved. Evidence of a reduction in carriage acquisition of invasive group B meningococcal strains, after vaccination among adolescents, is imperative if routine immunization is to drive population control of disease beyond those who are vaccinated (i.e. through herd immunity). The need for multiple doses to generate a sufficiently protective response and reactogenicity remain significant problems with the new generation of vaccines. Despite these limitations, early data from the UK indicate that new group B meningococcal vaccines have the potential to have a major impact on meningococcal disease, and to provide new insight into how we might do better in the future.",

We aimed to identify the highest, well-tolerated, and safest single dose of multipotent adult progenitor cells, and if they were efficacious as a treatment for stroke recovery. We did a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial of intravenous multipotent adult progenitor cells in 33 centres in the UK and the USA. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence and interactive voice and web response system to assign patients aged 18-83 years with moderately severe acute ischaemic stroke and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 8-20 to treatment with intravenous multipotent adult progenitor cells (400 million or 1200 million cells) or placebo between 24 h and 48 h after symptom onset. Patients were ineligible if there was a change in NIHSS of four or more points during at least a 6 h period between screening and randomisation, had brainstem or lacunar infarct, a substantial comorbid disease, an inability to undergo an MRI scan, or had a history of splenectomy. In group 1, patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive 400 million cells or placebo and assessed for safety through 7 days. In group 2, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive 1200 million cells or placebo and assessed for safety through the first 7 days. In group 3, patients were enrolled, randomly assigned, and stratified by baseline NIHSS score to receive 1200 million cells or placebo in a 1:1 ratio within 24-48 h. Patients, investigators, and clinicians were masked to treatment assignment. The primary safety outcome was dose-limiting toxicity effects. The primary efficacy endpoint was global stroke recovery, which combines dichotomised results from the modified Rankin scale, change in NIHSS score from baseline, and Barthel index at day 90. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT) including all patients in groups 2 and 3 who received the investigational agent or placebo.

After safety assessments in eight patients in group 1, 129 patients were randomly assigned (67 to receive multipotent adult progenitor cells and 62 to receive placebo) in groups 2 and 3 (1200 million cells). The ITT populations consisted of 65 patients who received multipotent adult progenitor cells and 61 patients who received placebo. There were no dose-limiting toxicity events in either group. There were no infusional or allergic reactions and no difference in treatment-emergent adverse events between the groups (64 [99%] of 65 patients in the multipotent adult progenitor cell group vs 59 [97%] of 61 in the placebo group).

This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of alemtuzumab and natalizumab in the treatment of different stages of MS patients. A total of 585 patients diagnosed with MS and hospitalized were included and analyzed after which they were divided into the primary progressive MS A and B groups, the relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) C and D groups, and the secondary progressive MS E and F groups. Patients in A, C, and E groups were administered alemtuzumab while those in B, D, and F groups were administered natalizumab for the treatment. The expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores and the EDSS difference were calculated before and after treatment. The number of head magnetic resonance imaging enhanced lesions in the patients, recurrence time and recurrence rate were measured before and after treatment. The EDSS score of the RRMS group was significantly lower than that of the primary progressive MS group and the secondary progressive MS group. After 12 months of treatment, the EDSS score of RRMS patients treated with natalizumab was significantly lower compared with the patients with alemtuzumab, and the difference before and after treatment was significantly higher than alemtuzumab. The recurrence rate of the RRMS-D group was significantly lower than the RRMS-C group. After 12 months of treatment, compared with the RRMS-C group, a significant reduction was observed in the number of head magnetic resonance imaging enhanced lesions and longer recurrence time in the RRMS-D group. The efficacy of natalizumab was better than alemtuzumab in the treatment of patients in the RRMS group, while there was no significant difference among other stages of MS patients, which provided the theoretical basis and clinical guidance for the treatment of different stages of MS.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29968175": "Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterised by demyelination, neuroaxonal loss and a heterogeneous clinical course. Multiple sclerosis presents with different phenotypes, most commonly a relapsing-remitting course and, less frequently, a progressive accumulation of disability from disease onset (primary progressive multiple sclerosis). The majority of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, after a variable time, switch to a stage characterised by gradual neurological worsening known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis, and it is believed that multiple genetic, environmental and endogenous factors are elements driving inflammation and ultimately neurodegeneration. Axonal loss and grey matter damage have been regarded as amongst the leading causes of irreversible neurological disability in the progressive stages. There are over a dozen disease-modifying therapies currently licenced for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but none of these has provided evidence of effectiveness in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Recently, there has been some early modest success with siponimod in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and ocrelizumab in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Finding treatments to delay or prevent the courses of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is an unmet and essential goal of the research in multiple sclerosis. In this review, we discuss new findings regarding drugs with immunomodulatory, neuroprotective or regenerative properties and possible treatment strategies for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We examine the field broadly to include trials where participants have progressive or relapsing phenotypes.

Differential expression and pathway analyses for distinct MS stages were defined and validated by literature mining. Genes located in the vicinity of MS risk variants displayed altered expression in peripheral blood at distinct stages of MS compared with the healthy population. The frequency of dysregulation was significantly higher than expected in CIS and progressive forms of MS. Pathway analysis for each MS stage-specific gene list showed that dysregulated genes contributed to pathogenic processes with scientific evidence in MS.

Areas covered: The latest knowledge about the pathophysiological changes occurring in MS have translated into novel treatments at different stages of development. Drugs for MS work mainly through modulating the inflammatory factors of the disease, but enhancing remyelination may be more successful in reducing long-term disability. Anti-LINGO-1 (opicinumab) is the first investigational product that achieved phase I trial with the aim of remyelination and axonal protection and/or repair in MS.

A linear dose-response in the probability of confirmed disability improvement was not seen (linear trend test p=0\u00b789). Adverse events occurred in 79 (85%) patients assigned placebo and in 275 (85%) assigned any dose of opicinumab. The most common adverse events of any grade in patients assigned any dose of opicinumab included influenza-like illness (140 [43%] with any dose of opicinumab vs 37 [40%] with placebo), multiple sclerosis relapses (117 [36%] vs 30 [32%]), and headache (51 [16%] vs 23 [25%]).

In multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders, several monoclonal antibodies have been suggested to decrease the incidence of clinical relapse and the disease activity. In MS, anti-\u03b14 integrin (natalizumab), anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab), anti-CD25 (daclizumab) and anti-CD20 (ocrelizumab) have been shown to effectively reduce the relapses in randomized controlled trials and have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Specifically, ocrelizumab is the first drug that has shown significant suppression of brain volume loss and suppression of chronic disability progression. In NMO, though there have yet to be any approved monoclonal antibodies, rituximab, anti-complement C5 (eculizumab), anti-IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab), anti-CD19 (inebilizumab) and non-pathogenic anti-aquaporin 4 (aquaporumab) have been suggested to be effective, and some of these are now under clinical trials. Aquaporumab is a non-pathogenic recombinant human monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of the pathogenic auto-antibody against aquaporin 4 in NMO patients; thus, it is expected to be highly disease specific with less non-specific adverse events. Some of these monoclonal antibodies in MS and NMO are known to cause several notable adverse events. Natalizumab and rituximab increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Eculizumab increases the risk of meningococcal infection. Tocilizumab is known to cause intestinal diverticulitis that can cause intestinal perforation.

Most solid tumors depend on other anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL-1, for survival. The recent description of S63845 as the first specific and potent MCL-1 inhibitor represents an important therapeutic advance, since MCL-1 is not targeted by the currently available BH3 mimetics, Navitoclax or Venetoclax, and is commonly associated with chemoresistance. In this study, we confirm a high binding affinity and selectivity of S63845 to induce apoptosis in MCL-1-dependent cancer cell lines. Furthermore, S63845 synergizes with other BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from both hematological and solid tumors. Although the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in these cell lines interact with a spectrum of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to regulate apoptosis, these interactions alone do not explain the relative sensitivities of these cell lines to BH3 mimetic-induced apoptosis. These findings necessitated further investigation into the requirement of BH3-only proteins in BH3 mimetic-mediated apoptosis. Concurrent inhibition of BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1 by BH3 mimetics in colorectal HCT116 cells induced apoptosis in a BAX- but not BAK-dependent manner. Remarkably this apoptosis was independent of all known BH3-only proteins. Although BH3-only proteins were required for apoptosis induced as a result of BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibition, this requirement was overcome when both BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1 were inhibited, implicating distinct mechanisms by which different anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members may regulate apoptosis in cancer.",

We tested the efficacy of the BH3 mimetic combination of A-1210477 (an MCL-1 inhibitor) and ABT-263 (a BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor) in killing melanoma, especially MICs. We also sought to better define Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP-1)'s role in melanoma; DRP-1 is known to interact with members of the BCL-2 family and is a possible therapeutic target for melanoma treatment. We used multiple assays (cell viability, apoptosis, bright field, immunoblot, and sphere formation), as well as the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing techniques. For clinical relevance, we employed patient samples of different mutation status, including some relapsed from current treatments such as anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We found the BH3 mimetic combination kill both the MICs and non-MICs (bulk of melanoma) in all cell lines and patient samples irrespective of the mutation status or relapsed state (p &lt; 0.05). Unexpectedly, the major pro-apoptotic proteins, NOXA and BIM, are not necessary for the combination-induced cell death. Furthermore, the combination impedes the activation of DRP-1, and inhibition of DRP-1 further enhances apoptosis (p &lt; 0.05). DRP-1 effects in melanoma differ from those seen in other cancer cells. These results provide new insights into BCL-2 family's regulation of the apoptotic pathway in melanoma, and suggest that inhibiting the major anti-apoptotic proteins is sufficient to induce cell death even without involvement from major pro-apoptotic proteins.

The aim of the current work was to determine how we might increase the efficacy of Bcl-2 family inhibitors in the absence of cytotoxic reagents, which are associated with negative side effect profiles. We assessed cell proliferation in Bcl-2 high-expressing NPC cells by CCK-8 assay after treatment with the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and/or the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845. Apoptotic induction by ABT-199 was evaluated by Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining. We also evaluated Bcl-2 family protein expression (Bim, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Noxa) after treatment with ABT-199 by western blotting. Finally, xenografted Balb/c nude mice were used to test ABT-199 efficacy in vivo, H&amp;E and immunohistochemistry assay were used to analyze tumor samples. ABT-199 effectively induced NPC cell apoptosis in vitro and in the xenograft model. Following ABT-199 treatment in NPC cells, upregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can lead to drug resistance, while concomitant Noxa overexpression partially neutralized the Mcl-1-caused resistance. Given that ABT-199 induces apoptosis in NPC cells through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, treatment avenues further targeting this pathway should be promising. Indeed, the newly developed Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 in combination with ABT-199 had a synergistic effect on NPC cell apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibition in NPC cells with ABT-199 triggers apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, and dual inhibition of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 provided a strong synergistic effect without the need for adjunctive cytotoxic agent treatment with cisplatin.",

This occurs when miRNAs bind nonspecifically to the viral structural protein Gag, interfering with viral RNA-mediated Gag assembly at the plasma membrane. Consequently, misassembled viral complexes are redirected into the endocytic pathway where they are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. In this study, we demonstrate that autophagy is a critical mediator of the viral degradation pathway and that this pathway is not HIV-1 specific. Misassembled viral complexes were found to colocalize extensively with LC3 and p62 in late endosomes/lysosomes, demonstrating a convergence of autophagy with functional degradative compartments. Knocking down autophagosome formation machineries reduced this convergence, while treatment with autophagy-inducer rapamycin enhanced the convergence. Furthermore, similar autophagy-dependent nonspecific miRNA inhibition of murine leukemia virus (MLV) assembly was shown. Overall, these results reveal autophagy as a crucial regulator of the retroviral degradation pathway in host cells initiated by nonspecific miRNA-Gag interactions.

However, viruses have evolved various strategies to manipulate and overtake host cell machinery to establish productive replication and maintain infectious process. In fact, replication of many viruses has been found to be autophagy-dependent and suppression of autophagy can potentially affect the viral replication. Thus, autophagy can either serve as an anti-viral defense mechanism or a pro-viral process that supports viral replication. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are known to co-opt cellular autophagy process as a pro-viral tool.

Autophagy can be induced by the infection with influenza A virus, which is considered as a necessary process for the viral proliferation, including the accumulation of viral elements during the replication of influenza A virus. On the other hand, influenza A virus can inhibit the autophagic formation via interaction with the autophagy-related genes (Atg) and signaling pathways. In addition, autophagy is involved in the influenza virus-regulated cell deaths, leading to significant changes in host apoptosis. Interestingly, the high pathogenic strains of influenza A virus, such as H5N1, stimulate autophagic cell death and appear to interplay with the autophagy in distinct ways as compared with low pathogenic strains. This review discusses the regulation of autophagy, an influenza A virus driven process.",

Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MPE-Fe(II) relative to MNase. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. The subnucleosome-sized MPE-seq peaks exhibit a particularly distinct association with active promoters. In addition, unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. In this regard, we found that DNA sequences at RNA splice sites are hypersensitive to digestion by MNase but not by MPE-Fe(II). This phenomenon may have affected the analysis of nucleosome occupancy over exons. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. In particular, the combined use of MPE-seq and MNase-seq enables the identification of noncanonical chromatin structures that are likely to be important for the regulation of gene expression.",

In a sensitivity analysis using a quality-effects model, the indirect VE in LMICs was not statistically significant (25%; 95% CI: 0-44%). Our findings highlight the importance of increasing rotavirus vaccine coverage, particularly in LMICs where evidence for indirect VE is limited and rotavirus burden is high.",

Chromosomal imbalances have been reported in several patients presenting with gonadal dysgenesis as part of severe dysmorphic phenotypes. We screened for submicroscopic DNA copy number variations in two sisters with an apparent normal 46,XY karyotype and female external genitalia due to gonadal dysgenesis, and in which mutations in known candidate genes had been excluded. By high-resolution tiling bacterial artificial chromosome array comparative genome hybridization, a submicroscopic duplication at Xp21.2 containing DAX1 (NR0B1) was identified. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiple ligation probe amplification, and PCR, the rearrangement was further characterized. This revealed a 637-kb tandem duplication that in addition to DAX1 includes the four MAGEB genes, the hypothetical gene CXorf21, GK, and part of the MAP3K7IP3 gene. Sequencing and analysis of the breakpoint boundaries and duplication junction suggest that the duplication originated through a coupled homologous and nonhomologous recombination process. This represents the first duplication on Xp21.2 identified in patients with isolated gonadal dysgenesis because all previously described XY subjects with Xp21 duplications presented with gonadal dysgenesis as part of a more complex phenotype, including mental retardation and/or malformations. Thus, our data support DAX1 as a dosage sensitive gene responsible for gonadal dysgenesis and highlight the importance of considering DAX1 locus duplications in the evaluation of all cases of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis.",

Although the etiology of SLE remains unclear, it is widely accepted that genetic factors could be involved in its pathogenesis. A number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of SLE in diverse populations. However, not all the SNP candidates identified from non-Asian populations have been validated in Koreans. In this study, we aimed to replicate the SNPs that were recently discovered in the GWAS; these SNPs have not been validated in Koreans or have only been replicated in Koreans with an insufficient sample size to conclude any association. For this, we selected five SNPs (rs1801274 in <i>FCGR2A</i> and rs2286672 in <i>PLD2</i>, rs887369 in <i>CXorf21</i>, rs9782955 in <i>LYST</i>, and rs3794060 in <i>NADSYN1</i>).

KS individuals often show language impairment and the phenotype might be due to overexpression of genes on the extra X chromosome(s). We profiled mRNA derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines from males with documented KS and control males using the Affymetrix U133P microarray platform. There were 129 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in KS group compared with controls after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery adjustment. The DEGs included 14 X chromosome genes which were significantly over-represented. The Y chromosome had zero DEGs. In exploratory analysis of gene expression-cognition relationships, 12 DEGs showed significant correlation of expression with measures of verbal cognition in KS. Overexpression of one pseudoautosomal gene, GTPBP6 (GTP binding protein 6, putative) was inversely correlated with verbal IQ (r = -0.86, P &lt; 0.001) and four other measures of verbal ability. Overexpression of XIST was found in KS compared to XY controls suggesting that silencing of many genes on the X chromosome might occur in KS similar to XX females. The microarray findings for eight DEGs were validated by quantitative PCR. The 14 X chromosome DEGs were not differentially expressed in prior studies comparing female and male brains suggesting a dysregulation profile unique to KS. Examination of X-linked DEGs, such as GTPBP6, TAF9L, and CXORF21, that show verbal cognition-gene expression correlations may establish a causal link between these genes, neurodevelopment, and language function. A screen of candidate genes may serve as biomarkers of KS for early diagnosis.",

Under these circumstances, the classical Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is suboptimal. Robust procedures that maximize the power and preserve the nominal type I error rate are preferable. Moreover, performing a meta-analysis using robust procedures is of great interest and has never been addressed in the past. The primary goal of this work is to implement several robust methods for analysis and meta-analysis in the statistical package Stata and subsequently to make the software available to the scientific community. The CATT under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance as well as robust methods based on the Maximum Efficiency Robust Test statistic, the MAX statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX and MIN2, we calculated their asymptotic null distributions relying on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational time without losing accuracy. All the aforementioned approaches were employed in a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis setting using summary data with weights equal to the reciprocal of the combined cases and controls. Overall, this is the first complete effort to implement procedures for analysis and meta-analysis in GWAS using Stata.

Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution.",

Generally, lncRNAs are defined as RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not transcribed into proteins. In recent years, lncRNAs have been reported to play oncogenic roles in tumourigenesis. However, minimal research has been performed on the expression and clinicopathological significance of lncRNAs in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). In the present study, we investigated not only the expression and clinicopathological significance of a novel lncRNA, NR_036575.1, in PTC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues but also its potential function in TPC1 cells. The expression levels of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 in 83 pairs of PTC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The relationships between the expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 were analysed. In addition, we established two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the diagnostic value of NR_036575.1 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 and transwell assays were used to assess cell proliferation and migration, respectively. The expression levels of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 were significantly higher in PTC tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High NR_036575.1 expression was associated with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) (P = 0.011) and tumour size (P = 0.006). The ROC curves indicated that NR_036575.1 could potentially serve as a biomarker for identifying PTC and related, non-cancerous diseases (sensitivity, 80.7 %; specificity, 88 %), as well as for differentiating between PTC with or without ETE (sensitivity, 57.8 %; specificity, 86.7 %). NR_036575.1 knock-down significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of TPC1 cells. Our findings are the first to describe lncRNA NR_036575.1 overexpression in PTC. NR_036575.1 expression was associated with both ETE and tumour size. In addition, NR_036575.1 modulation could regulate TPC1 cell proliferation and migration.

Metastasis is a process by which cancer spreads from the place at which it first arose to distant locations in the body. It is well known that several steps are necessary for this process, including cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, resistance to anoikis, and angiogenesis. Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanism of regulating cancer metastasis progress may provide helpful insights in the development of efficient diagnosis and therapeutic strategy. Recent studies have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in cancer metastasis. lncRNAs are the nonprotein coding RNAs that have a size longer than 200 nucleotides. More and more studies have indicated that lncRNAs are involved in a broad range of biological processes and are associated with many diseases, such as cancer.

We analyzed the transcriptome profiles of human OSCC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues from two patients through a next-generation sequencing approach. A total of 14 lncRNAs were upregulated (fold change \u22653) and 13 were downregulated (fold change \u2264-3) in OSCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. SOX21-AS1 was subjected to further analysis, revealing that the expression levels of SOX21-AS1 significantly decreased in OSCC compared with the adjacent normal tissue. The promoter activity of SOX21-AS1 was obviously suppressed by in vitro methylation. The DNA methylation status of the SOX21-AS1 promoter was analyzed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis, revealing that the aberrant promoter hypermethylation of SOX21-AS1 was observed frequently in OSCC tissues. The effects of SOX21-AS1 on cell proliferation and invasion were examined through transient transfection. Our data showed that SOX21-AS1 could significantly suppress oral cancer cell growth and invasion.

Hormone replacement therapy is effective but is not without risk. Neurokinin B signalling is increased in menopausal women, and has been implicated as an important mediator of hot flushes. This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, crossover trial assessed the effectiveness of an oral neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist (MLE4901) on menopausal hot flushes. Eligible participants were healthy women aged 40-62 years, having seven or more hot flushes in every 24 h of which some were reported as being severe or bothersome, who had not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months, and who had not been taking any medication shown to improve menopausal flushes in the preceding 8 weeks. Participants received 4 weeks of MLE4901 (40 mg, orally, twice daily) and placebo (orally, twice daily) in random order separated by a 2 week washout period. Randomisation was completed by a central computer, and participants were allocated to treatment number in numerical order. The primary outcome was the total number of hot flushes during the final week of both treatment periods. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol using generalised linear mixed models and standard crossover analysis. All analyses were prespecified in the study protocol.

The emergence of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has been considered to be because of the excessive use of antimalarial drugs worldwide. Moreover, the intense distribution and prevalence of chloroquine-resistant strains in endemic regions has aided the incidence of more complications to malaria treatment and control. Due to the lack of literature that portrays evident molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, it has been difficult to understand the drug resistance conferred by Plasmodium species. Intensive research on CQ drug resistance has identified the association of P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter protein (PfCRT), which belongs to the drug/metabolite transporter and EamA-like superfamily. Additionally, it has shown that K76 T mutation in PfCRT protein has mainly attributed to CQ resistance than other mutations. This study deals with the development of an in silico model of the PfCRT protein and its interaction with the CQ ligand molecule as well as the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the transmembrane domain 1 (TMD 1) peptide of the PfCRT protein. The physiochemical analysis of the PfCRT protein identified basic differences between the wild and mutant forms of the protein, as well as identifying the high hydrophobic nature of the mutant-type protein. The tertiary structure of the PfCRT protein was predicted and interaction with CQ revealed different active pocket binding regions in both the wild and mutant form of PfCRT proteins. The CQ<sup>2+</sup> molecule interacts with TMD 10 of the wild-type PfCRT protein, whereas it interacts with TMD 1 of the mutant-type protein. Studies on the TMD 1 peptide revealed the insertion of the peptide in the micelles adopting stable alpha-helical structure. Binding studies with the CQ molecule detected high binding affinity toward the mutant-type TMD 1 peptide rather than the wild-type, thus confirming that the TMD 1 peptide is involved in substrate selectivity. Our findings help to characterize the structure of the PfCRT protein and the role played by the TMD 1 region in CQ resistance using in silico and biochemical approaches. Molecular docking and ligand binding studies confirm that TMD 1 is involved in substrate selectivity and aids in CQ efflux, thereby contributing to the parasite's CQ drug resistance mechanism.",

The selective pressure of chloroquine therapy led to the rapid emergence of chloroquine resistant parasites. Resistance has been attributed to the Plasmodium falciparum Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT), an integral membrane protein of unknown structure. A PfCRT structure would provide new insights into how the protein confers chloroquine resistance and thereby also yield novel opportunities for developing anti-malarial therapies. Although PfCRT is an attractive target for characterisation and structure determination, very little work has been published on its expression and purification. Here we present a medium throughput protocol, employing Sf9 insect cells, for testing the expression, stability and purification yield of rationally designed PfCRT mutant constructs and constructs of a PfCRT orthologue from Neospora caninum (NcCRT). We have identified a conserved cysteine residue in PfCRT that results in elevated protein stability when mutated. Combining this mutation with the insertion of T4-lysozyme into a specific surface loop further augments PfCRT protein yield and thermostability. Screening also identified an NcCRT construct with an elevated purification yield. Furthermore it was possible to purify both PfCRT and NcCRT constructs at milligram-scales, with high purities and with size exclusion chromatography profiles that were consistent with monodispersed, homogeneous protein.",

Antagonizing HMGB1 prolongs muscle necrosis and deters regeneration. In this study, we evaluated HMGB1 expression in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the mechanisms that promote its release in a murine model of hindlimb ischemia. Specifically, we investigated how chloroquine (CQ), a commonly employed disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, promotes HMGB1 release from muscle. We hypothesized that CQ could increase HMGB1 locally and systemically, allowing it to mediate recovery from ischemic injury. Muscle biopsies were performed on patients undergoing lower extremity surgery for non-PAD-related disease as well as for claudication and critical limb ischemia. Clinical symptoms and ankle-brachial indices were recorded for each patient. HMGB1 was detected in muscle sections using immunohistochemical staining. Unilateral femoral artery ligation was performed on both wild-type and inducible HMGB1 knockout mice. Wild-type mice were administered intraperitoneal CQ 2 weeks before and after femoral artery ligation. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging was used to determine perfusion recovery. Serum and tissue levels of HMGB1 were measured at designated time points. In vitro, cultured C2C12 myoblasts were treated with increasing doses of CQ. HMGB1, autophagosome formation, p62/SQSTM1 accumulation, caspase-1 expression and activity, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were measured in supernatants and cell lysates. Nuclear expression of HMGB1 was prominent in patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia (P &lt; .05) compared with controls. CQ-treated mice had elevated serum HMGB1 and diffuse HMGB1 staining in muscle (P &lt; .01). In wild-type mice, CQ treatment resulted in higher laser Doppler perfusion imaging ratios in the ischemic limb at 7 days (P &lt; .03) and less fat replacement after 2 weeks (P &lt; .03). In cultured myoblasts, CQ induced autophagosome accumulation, inhibited p62/SQSTM-1 degradation, and activated caspase-1. HMGB1 is prominently expressed in PAD muscle but mostly confined to the nucleus. Our in vivo data suggest that HMGB1 mobilization into the sarcoplasm and serum can be increased with CQ, possibly through caspase-1-mediated pathways.

It is also licensed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies of HCQ-treated patients with SLE or RA have demonstrated a positive correlation between whole-blood HCQ levels and clinical response. Such studies have involved measuring whole-blood concentrations at any given time point after HCQ ingestion assuming that steady-state concentrations would undergo limited fluctuation over a daily interval because HCQ has a long half-life. This approach might not sufficiently take into account the potential intra-patient variation in HCQ blood levels that can occur over a 24-hour period. Such variation, if significant, could affect the credibility of any concentration-response relationship provided from these previous studies. Objectives The objectives of this report are to: (a) investigate the intra-patient variation in HCQ whole-blood levels and (b) suggest an optimum time for sampling patients for future studies. Methods Six patients were recruited with cutaneous lupus erythematosus who had each been on HCQ 200 mg twice daily for at least six months, so that they were at steady-state. Each patient was fasted overnight and had standardized meals and dosing schedule. Whole blood was sampled at seven time points over 24 hours. Whole-blood HCQ levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution, fluorimetric detection and chloroquine as an internal standard. The assay had a mean inter- and intra-day coefficient of variation of 10% and 5% respectively and a limit of detection of 5ng/ml. Results HCQ levels appeared to follow a biphasic pattern over the sampling period. Maximum levels were noted a median of four hours (range 2-6) after ingestion. Median intra-patient variation between trough and peak levels, 'Cmax' ((peak - trough)/trough \u00d7 100%), was 27% (range 8-150%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that whole-blood HCQ levels vary 27% (median, range 8-150%) within an individual over a 12-hour period. Drug levels might differ between individuals because of multiple factors, including variable adherence to medication. Measuring HCQ levels for assessment of drug adherence could be valuable in the 'real-world' clinical setting. This could be assessed by taking a blood sample at any time following HCQ ingestion. If patients were found to have very low or undetectable levels of HCQ, non-adherence to HCQ should be suspected.",

No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection.

We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables. We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison \"usual activities\", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with \"usual activities\" or \"usual care\" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND.None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting. This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life).",

They commonly affect people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) at all stages of the disease. To date, the treatment of muscle cramps in ALS has been largely empirical without any evidence from randomised controlled trials. To systematically assess the effect of interventions on muscle cramps as a primary or secondary endpoint or adverse event in people with ALS/MND. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (14 February 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2011 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011) and reference lists of articles searched using the terms motor neuron disease, motor neurone disease, motoneuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We contacted authors of trials for further information. We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials of oral medications in people with ALS which assessed cramps as a primary or secondary outcome measure or as an adverse event. We also included trials using subcutaneous or intravenous medications or physical therapy. All authors applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality independently, and all authors performed independent data extraction. Twenty studies including 4789 participants were identified. Only one trial, of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), assessed cramps as the primary endpoint. Thirteen studies assessed cramps as a secondary endpoint. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L-threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six studies assessed cramps as an adverse event. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine, and lithium. In all 20 studies no favourable effect for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND could be demonstrated, but many studies were underpowered to draw a definite conclusion. A meta-analysis of two small studies showed a statistically nonsignificant result for the amino acid L-threonine for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND. No study was identified using physical therapy as a therapeutic intervention for cramps. There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention for muscle cramps in ALS/MND. More and larger randomised controlled trials evaluating treatments for muscle cramps in ALS/MND are needed.",

We report the safety and functional efficacy results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study of xaliproden, a non-peptidic compound with growth factor activities, in 54 ALS patients treated for up to 32 weeks. In order to overcome the interference of mortality with functional assessment in exploratory studies, we identified from our ALS database prognostic factors to establish a staging process for selection pf patients: age, disease duration, slopes of deterioration of the functional scores calculated during the two months prior to the inclusion, and the value at entry of the forced vital capacity (FVC). The six months intent-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant effect but a trend in favour of 2 mg xaliproden compared to placebo for reduction in the rate of deterioration of FVC, limbs functional score, and manual muscle testing score (MMT). The results in the completer analysis showed a significant 43% slower rate of deterioration in FVC (P=0.046) in xaliproden-treated patients but not in functional and MMT scores. These results support the use of a staging process to select suitable patients for phase II studies, and suggest that xaliproden may have potential effects in ALS and deserve further study.",

We carried out two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, multi-national studies with xaliproden (a drug with neurotrophic effect) to assess drug efficacy and safety at two doses. Patients with clinically probable or definite ALS of more than 6 months and less than 5 years duration were randomly assigned to placebo, 1 mg or 2 mg xaliproden orally once daily as monotherapy in Study 1 (n=867); or to the same regimen with addition of riluzole 50 mg bid background therapy in Study 2 (n=1210 patients). The two primary endpoints were defined as: 1. Time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation (DTP), and 2. Time to vital capacity (VC)&lt;50% or DTP before (log-rank test) and after adjustment using a Cox proportional hazard model for prespecified prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints were rates of change of various functional measures. In Study 1, primary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. For the 2 mg group, for time to VC&lt;50% analysis (without DTP) a significant 30% RRR was obtained (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.46, P=0.009). In Study 2, no significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend in favour of add-on 1 mg dose xaliproden vs. placebo (RRR 15% [-6.31, ns] for time to VC&lt;50%; RRR 12% [CI: -6.27, ns] for time to VC&lt;50% or DTP). Adjusted RR ratios were consistently more favourable for the xaliproden groups. Tolerability was good, and dose-dependent side effects were largely associated with the serotonergic properties of xaliproden. An effect of xaliproden on functional parameters, especially VC, was noted. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance, xaliproden had a small effect on clinically noteworthy aspects of disease progression in ALS.",

They can serve as a cutaneous marker for a number of primary (mostly hereditary) disorders and they can be secondary to other (systemic) diseases. Patients with telangiectasias are seen by general health practitioners, pediatricians, (pediatric) neurologists, dermatologists, and ophthalmologists. In this article we give an overview of the different disorders in which telangiectasias are a prominent feature, focusing on neurocutaneous disorders in which they serve as a marker for establishing the right diagnosis. The pattern of distribution of the telangiectasias, their age of onset and associated features are helpful to distinguish between the different disorders.",

The cutaneous lesions of NLE are usually transient, disappearing about six months after birth, but telangiectasia is a rare complication of NLE which persists. Telangiectasias are small focal red macules and papules created by abnormally prominent capillaries, venules, and arterioles and are a characteristic marker of connective tissue diseases. We report the case of an infant diagnosed with NLE presenting typical annular lesions, positive ANA and positive anti-Ro antibodies. By five months of age, both ANA and anti-Ro antibodies were negative and the annular cutaneous lesions had gradually faded, but small scattered focal red macules appeared on the face, especially in the peri-orbital area and scalp. The cutaneous lupus disappeared but the telangiectasia persisted. We would like to suggest that the diagnosis of NLE should be considered when cutaneous telangiectasias are observed in infants.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11316039": "Scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by skin sclerosis, calcinosis and changes in microvasculature. The etiology of the disease is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Telangiectasia (macroscopically visible dilated skin vessels) occurring primarily on the hands and face, are a prominent feature in scleroderma and are present in the majority of patients. Similarly, telangiectasia are found in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a mutational disorder of the germline genes endoglin and ALK-1, members of the TGFbeta receptor family, expressed on endothelial cells. Our study investigated the number, distribution and microscopic characteristics of telangiectasia in both limited (n = 29) and diffuse scleroderma (n = 9) and compared findings with 3 patients with HHT. In limited scleroderma, the mean number of telangiectasia (hand and face) was 36 (0-150) compared with 23 (0-135) in diffuse scieroderma. A significant correlation was observed between the number of telangiectasia on the face and on the hands (p = 0.014). The total number of telangiectasia correlated significantly with the disease duration (p = 0.009). The spatial distribution of the telangiectasia appeared to be random on both hands and foreface in contrast with the distribution of subcutaneous calcification of the hands which occurred predominantly on the distal and flexor surfaces of the first, second and fifth digits. Nailfold microscopic capillaroscopy was performed on 12 patients. No significant correlation was observed between capillary diameter or density and with total number of telangiectasia observed macroscopically. The distribution and microscopic appearance of telangiectasia in scleroderma appeared very similar to those observed in HHT. In view of these similarities we therefore conclude that telangiectactic development in scleroderma may be associated with disorders of the TGFb receptor family proteins found on the microvasculature.",

Mutations in BMPR1A or SMAD4 are found in 50% of individuals. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a dominant disorder characterized by epistaxis, visceral arteriovenous malformations, and telangiectasias. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is diagnosed when \u2265 3 criteria including clinical manifestations or a family history, are present. A juvenile polyposis-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia overlap syndrome has previously been reported in 22% of patients with juvenile polyposis due to a SMAD4 mutation. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia by Curacao criteria in our juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients. This was a cohort study of juvenile polyposis patients in our inherited colon cancer registries. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia manifestations were obtained from medical records, patient contact, and/or prospective hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening. The Curacao criteria was used for diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (\u2265 3 criteria diagnostic; 2 criteria suspect of). Prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients. Forty-one juvenile polyposis families were identified. Genetic testing was available for individuals within 18 families. SMAD4 mutations were found in 21 relatives in 9 families. Eighty-one percent of SMAD4 patients had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and 14% were suspected of having hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Epistaxis and asthma are the most common symptoms in our overlap patients. Symptomatic and subclinical arteriovenous malformations were noted near universally. There was a single, tertiary referral center. Nearly all juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients have the overlap syndrome. The clinical implications and need for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening are important factors for genetic testing in juvenile polyposis. Health care providers must be cognizant of the juvenile polyposis-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia overlap syndrome and the implications for management of these patients.",

The outbreaks of Ebola viruses in 2014 represented the most serious Ebola epidemics in history and greatly threatened public health worldwide. The development of additional effective anti-Ebola therapeutic agents is therefore quite urgent. In this study, via high throughput screening of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, we identified that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, potently prevents the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, teicoplanin also has an inhibitory effect on transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles, with an IC50 as low as 330 nm Comparative analysis further demonstrated that teicoplanin is able to block the entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) envelope pseudotyped viruses as well. Teicoplanin derivatives such as dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola, MERS, and SARS viruses. Mechanistic studies showed that teicoplanin blocks Ebola virus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, opening a novel avenue for the development of additional glycopeptides as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses. Notably, given that teicoplanin has routinely been used in the clinic with low toxicity, our work provides a promising prospect for the prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola, MERS, and SARS virus infection.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27733646": "Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), a causative agent of the common cold, enters host cells via two distinct pathways: one is mediated by cell surface proteases, particularly transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and the other by endosomal cathepsin L. Thus, specific inhibitors of these proteases block virus infection. However, it is unclear which of these pathways is actually utilized by HCoV-229E in the human respiratory tract. Here, we examined the mechanism of cell entry used by a pseudotyped virus bearing the HCoV-229E spike (S) protein in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. We found that, compared with a laboratory strain isolated in 1966 and passaged for a half century, clinical isolates of HCoV-229E were less likely to utilize cathepsin L; rather, they showed a preference for TMPRSS2. Two amino acid substitutions (R642M and N714K) in the S protein of HCoV-229E clinical isolates altered their sensitivity to a cathepsin L inhibitor, suggesting that these amino acids were responsible for cathepsin L use. After 20 passages in HeLa cells, the ability of the isolate to use cathepsin increased so that it was equal to that of the laboratory strain; this increase was caused by an amino acid substitution (I577S) in the S protein. The passaged virus showed a reduced ability to replicate in differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface. These results suggest that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection of human airway epithelial cells; therefore, clinical isolates are less able to use cathepsin. Many enveloped viruses enter cells through endocytosis. Viral spike proteins drive the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to facilitate insertion of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) utilizes endosomal cathepsin L to activate the spike protein after receptor binding. Here, we found that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferentially utilize the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin L. The endosome is a main site of Toll-like receptor recognition, which then triggers an innate immune response; therefore, HCoV-229E presumably evolved to bypass the endosome by entering the cell via TMPRSS2. Thus, the virus uses a simple mechanism to evade the host innate immune system. Therefore, therapeutic agents for coronavirus-mediated diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), should target cell surface TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin.",

Here we report on enhanced levels and altered subcellular localization of distinct cysteine cathepsins in adenocarcinoma tissue in comparison to adjacent normal colon. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting investigations revealed the presence of cathepsin L in the nuclear compartment in addition to its expected endo-lysosomal localization in colorectal carcinoma cells. Cathepsin L was represented as the full-length protein in the nuclei of HCT116 cells from which stefin B, a potent cathepsin L inhibitor, was absent. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses with synchronized cell cultures revealed deceleration of cell cycle progression of HCT116 cells upon inhibition of cathepsin L activity, while expression of cathepsin L-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimeras accelerated S-phase entry. We conclude that the activity of cathepsin L is high in the nucleus of colorectal carcinoma cells because of lacking stefin B inhibitory activity. Furthermore, we hypothesize that nuclear cathepsin L accelerates cell cycle progression of HCT116 cells thereby supporting the notion that cysteine cathepsins may play significant roles in carcinogenesis due to deregulated trafficking.",

The fusion (F) protein of Hendra virus is critical for promoting viral entry and cell-to-cell fusion. To be fusogenically active, Hendra virus F must undergo endocytic recycling and cleavage by the endosomal/lysosomal protease cathepsin L, but the route of Hendra virus F following internalization and the recycling signals involved are poorly understood. We examined the intracellular distribution of Hendra virus F following endocytosis and showed that it is primarily present in Rab5- and Rab4-positive endosomal compartments, suggesting that cathepsin L cleavage occurs in early endosomes. Hendra virus F transmembrane domain (TMD) residues S490 and Y498 were found to be important for correct Hendra virus F recycling, with the hydroxyl group of S490 and the aromatic ring of Y498 important for this process. In addition, changes in association of isolated Hendra virus F TMDs correlated with alterations to Hendra virus F recycling, suggesting that appropriate TMD interactions play an important role in endocytic trafficking.",

Changes in the levels of ACE2 have been observed in a number of pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, but little is known of the mechanisms regulating its expression. In the present study, therefore, the potential role of miRNAs in the regulation of ACE2 expression in primary human cardiac myofibroblasts was examined. Putative miRNA-binding sites were identified in the 3'-UTR of the ACE2 transcript using online prediction algorithms. Two of these, miR-200b and miR-421, were selected for further analysis. A reporter system using the 3'-UTR of ACE2 fused to the coding region of firefly luciferase was used to determine the functionality of the identified binding sites in vitro. This identified miR-421, but not miR-200b, as a potential regulator of ACE2. The ability of miR-421, an miRNA implicated in the development of thrombosis, to down-regulate ACE2 expression was subsequently confirmed by Western blot analysis of both primary cardiac myofibroblasts and transformed cells transfected with a synthetic miR-421 precursor. Real-time PCR analysis of miR-421 revealed widespread expression in human tissues. miR-421 levels in cardiac myofibroblasts showed significant inter-patient variability, in keeping with the variability of ACE2 expression we have observed previously. In conclusion, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ACE2 may be subject to post-transcriptional regulation and reveals a novel potential therapeutic target, miR-421, which could be exploited to modulate ACE2 expression in disease.",

ACE2 has been identified in various tissues and is supposed to be a modulator of cardiovascular function. Decreases in ACE2 expression and activity have been reported in models of hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy and others. In addition, the expression level and/or activity are affected by other renin-angiotensin system components (e.g., ACE and AT1 receptors). Local inhibition or global deletion of brain ACE2 induces a reduction in baroreflex sensitivity. Moreover, ACE2-null mice have been shown to exhibit either blood pressure or cardiac dysfunction phenotypes. On the other hand, over-expression of ACE2 exerts protective effects in local tissues, including the brain. In this review, we will first summarize the major findings linking ACE2 to cardiovascular function in the periphery then focus on recent discoveries related to ACE2 in the CNS. Finally, we will unveil new tools designed to address the importance of central ACE2 in various diseases, and discuss the potential for this carboxypeptidase as a new target in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",

Pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature but extra-pulmonary manifestations are also common. Factors that account for the wide spectrum of organ system involvement and disease severity are poorly understood and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection remains unclear. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as the functional cellular receptor for SARS-CoV. Studies of the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV, and ACE2 protein expression, reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of this deadly disease. ACE2 is expressed at high level in the primary target cells of SARS-CoV, namely pneumocytes and surface enterocytes of the small intestine. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV can infect the lung and intestine, the tissue responses in these two organs are different. All other tissues and cell types expressing ACE2 may be potential targets of SARS-CoV infection. Remarkably, endothelial cells, which express ACE2 to a high level, have not been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV. There is also evidence that cell types without detectable ACE2 expression may also be infected by the virus. Furthermore, studies in a new human cell culture model have indicated that the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection. Therefore, other virus receptors or co-receptors may be required in different tissues. Moreover, the interaction between SARS-CoV and the immunological or lymphoid system remains to be defined. It is clear that we are only at the dawn of our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS. As our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms improves, a more rational approach to therapeutic and vaccine development can be designed in order to combat this new and fatal human disease.",

This study was to determine whether the damage was correlated with expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in different organs, especially in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas, and to elucidate the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in SARS patients. The effect of clinical variables on survival was estimated in 135 SARS patients who died, 385 hospitalized SARS patients who survived, and 19 patients with non-SARS pneumonia. A total of 39 SARS patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment were compared to 39 matched healthy siblings during a 3-year follow-up period. The pattern of SARS coronavirus receptor-ACE2 proteins in different human organs was also studied. Significant elevations in oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), but not in alanine transaminase were predictors for death. Abundant ACE2 immunostaining was found in lung, kidney, heart, and islets of pancreas, but not in hepatocytes. Twenty of the 39 followed-up patients were diabetic during hospitalization. After 3 years, only two of these patients had diabetes. Compared with their non-SARS siblings, these patients exhibited no significant differences in FPG, postprandial glucose (PPG), and insulin levels. The organ involvements of SARS correlated with organ expression of ACE2. The localization of ACE2 expression in the endocrine part of the pancreas suggests that SARS coronavirus enters islets using ACE2 as its receptor and damages islets causing acute diabetes.",

In order to find human genomic sites capable of supporting long-term and high-level transgene expression in hPSCs, we performed a lentiviral screen in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We isolated 40 iPSC clones each harboring a single vector copy and characterized the level of transgene expression afforded by each unique integration site. We selected one clone, LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). The LiPS-A3 line can greatly facilitate the insertion of reporter and other genes in hPSCs. Targeting transgenes in the LiPS-A3S genomic locus can find broad applications in stem cell research and possibly cell and gene therapy.",

Demographic data (age, sex, color, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] status, previous surgery, and body mass index) and surgical outcomes (length of stay, early and late morbidity, reoperation, and mortality rates) were compared among 63 patients undergoing IPAA. Demographic features were similar among patients (25 open and 38 LAP). Conversely, colorectal cancer at diagnosis prevailed in the open group (60% versus 31.6%; P = .02). Tumor stages (P = .65) and previous surgery index (20% versus 10.5%; P = .46) were similar. Surgical length was longer for LAP (374 versus 281 minutes, P = .003). Short-term complication rates (28% versus 28.9%), hospital stay (10.9 versus 8.9 days), and total long-term reoperations (28% versus 21%) were not statistically different.

The W and K designs resulted in fewer cases of pouch failure compared with the J and S designs. J pouch construction resulted in a smaller maximum pouch volume compared with W and K pouches. Stool frequency per 24 h and during daytime was higher following a J pouch than W, S or K constructions. The J design resulted in increased faecal urgency and seepage during daytime compared with the K design. The use of protective pads during daytime and night-time was greater with a J pouch compared to S or K. The use of antidiarrhoeal medication was greater after a J reservoir than a W reservoir. Difficulty in pouch evacuation requiring intubation was higher with an S pouch than with W or J pouches. Despite its ease of construction and comparable complication rates, the J pouch is associated with higher pouch failure rates and worse function. Patient characteristics, technical factors and surgical expertise should be considered when choosing pouch design.",

Overall, this operation is associated with a low rate of postoperative morbidity and good long-term function. However, when complications develop, there is a heavy reliance on imaging to facilitate an accurate diagnosis. Reported postoperative complication rates range from 5% to 35%. Complications generally can be categorized as structural, inflammatory, or neoplastic conditions. Structural complications include leaks, strictures, afferent and efferent limb syndromes, and pouch prolapse. Inflammatory conditions include cuffitis, pouchitis, and Crohn disease of the pouch. In addition, a variety of neoplastic conditions can develop in the pouch. Overall, pouchitis and leaks are the most common complications, occurring in up to 50% and 20% of individuals, respectively. Many imaging modalities are used to evaluate the J pouch and associated postoperative complications. The indications and various surgical techniques for J pouch surgery, normal postoperative appearance of the pouch, and most common associated complications are reviewed. In addition, the various imaging findings associated with J pouch surgery are described and illustrated. The radiologist's familiarity with the potential complications of the pouch can facilitate appropriate imaging, hasten an accurate diagnosis, and aid in rendering proper management. <sup>\u00a9</sup>RSNA, 2018.",

It is important to restrict the transgene expression to the desired cell type within the kidney, so that the physiological endpoints represent the function of the transgene expressed in that specific cell type within kidney. We hypothesized that segment-specific gene expression within the kidney can be accomplished using the highly efficient AAV9 vectors carrying the promoters of genes that are expressed exclusively in the desired segment of the nephron in combination with administration by retrograde infusion into the kidney via the ureter. We constructed AAV vectors carrying eGFP under the control of: kidney-specific cadherin (KSPC) gene promoter for expression in the entire nephron; Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) gene promoter for expression in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule; sodium, potassium, 2 chloride co-transporter (NKCC2) gene promoter for expression in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH); E-cadherin (ECAD) gene promoter for expression in the collecting duct (CD); and cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter that provides expression in most of the mammalian cells, as control. We tested the specificity of the promoter constructs in vitro for cell type-specific expression in mouse kidney cells in primary culture, followed by retrograde infusion of the AAV vectors via the ureter in the mouse. Our data show that AAV9 vector, in combination with the segment-specific promoters administered by retrograde infusion via the ureter, provides renal nephron segment-specific gene expression.",

Although effects on potassium and sodium channels along the connecting and collecting tubules have also been documented, WNK4 is typically believed to have little role in modulating sodium chloride reabsorption along the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Yet wnk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice (knockout mice lacking WNK4) do not demonstrate the hypocalciuria typical of pure distal convoluted tubule dysfunction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that WNK4 also modulates bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) function along the thick ascending limb. We confirmed that w nk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice are hypokalemic and waste sodium chloride, but are also normocalciuric. Results from Western blots suggested that the phosphorylated forms of both NCC and NKCC2 were in lower abundance in wnk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in controls. This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Although the initial response to furosemide was similar in wnk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice and controls, the response was lower in the knockout mice when reabsorption along the distal convoluted tubule was inhibited. Using HEK293 cells, we showed that WNK4 increases the abundance of phosphorylated NKCC2. More supporting evidence that WNK4 may modulate NKCC2 emerges from a mouse model of WNK4-mediated familial hyperkalemic hypertension in which more phosphorylated NKCC2 is present than in controls. These data indicate that WNK4, in addition to modulating NCC, also modulates NKCC2, contributing to its physiological function in vivo.",

Despite the unique location and recent association of THP gene mutations with hereditary uromodulin-associated kidney disease and THP single nucleotide polymorphisms with chronic kidney disease and hypertension, the physiological function(s) of THP and its pathological involvement remain incompletely understood. By studying age-dependent changes of THP knockout (KO) mice, we show here that young KO mice had significant salt and water wasting but were partially responsive to furosemide, due to decreased luminal translocation of Na-K-Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) in the TAL. Aged THP KO mice were, however, markedly oliguric and unresponsive to furosemide, and their NKCC2 was localized primarily in the cytoplasm as evidenced by lipid raft floatation assay, cell fractionation, and confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. These aged KO mice responded to metolazone and acetazolamide, known to target distal and proximal tubules, respectively. They also had marked upregulation of renin in juxtaglomerular apparatus and serum, and they were hypertensive. Finally, the aged THP KO mice had significant upregulation of Na-coupled urate transporters Slc5a8 and Slc22a12 as well as sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the proximal tubule and elevated serum uric acid and allantoin. Collectively, our results suggest that THP deficiency can cause progressive disturbances in renal functions via initially NKCC2 dysfunction and later compensatory responses, resulting in prolonged activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and hyperuricemia.",

The combinations of minocycline-creatine and celecoxib-creatine have additive effects in the murine model. New trial designs are needed to efficiently screen the growing number of potential neuroprotective agents. Our objective was to assess two drug combinations in ALS using a novel phase II trial design. We conducted a randomized, double-blind selection trial in sequential pools of 60 patients. Participants received minocycline (100 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily or celecoxib (400 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily for six months. The primary objective was treatment selection based on which combination best slowed deterioration in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R); the trial could be stopped after one pool if the difference between the two arms was adequately large. At trial conclusion, each arm was compared to a historical control group in a futility analysis. Safety measures were also examined. After the first patient pool, the mean six-month decline in ALSFRS-R was 5.27 (SD=5.54) in the celecoxib-creatine group and 6.47 (SD=9.14) in the minocycline-creatine group. The corresponding decline was 5.82 (SD=6.77) in the historical controls. The difference between the two sample means exceeded the stopping criterion. The null hypothesis of superiority was not rejected in the futility analysis. Skin rash occurred more frequently in the celecoxib-creatine group. In conclusion, the celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferable to the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation. This phase II design was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and can be used in other phase II trials to assess different agents.",

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted. Three hundred research subjects with ALS were randomized (2:1) to receive celecoxib (800 mg/day) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in upper extremity motor function measured by the maximum voluntary isometric contraction strength. Secondary end points included safety, survival, change in cerebrospinal fluid prostaglandin E(2) levels, and changes in the rate of decline of leg and grip strength, vital capacity, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, and motor unit number estimates. Celecoxib did not slow the decline in muscle strength, vital capacity, motor unit number estimates, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, or affect survival. Celecoxib was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased frequency of adverse events. Prostaglandin E(2) levels in cerebrospinal fluid were not elevated at baseline and did not decline with treatment. At the dosage studied, celecoxib did not have a beneficial effect on research subjects with ALS, and it was safe. A biological effect of celecoxib was not demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Fen induces abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are linked to its hazardous effects. However, this view is controversial and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, the effects of Fen on cadmium (Cd)-induced apoptosis and the associated molecular mechanisms were investigated in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells. U937 cells were treated with 50 \u03bcm cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub> ) with or without Fen pretreatment at 1-50 \u03bcm. Apoptosis was evaluated by externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2 family members were determined by western blot analysis. The results revealed that pretreatment with Fen at 20 \u03bcm for 12 hours significantly inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis. Decreased expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Noxa and Bid) and increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP) were observed after combined treatment with Fen and CdCl<sub>2</sub> . Phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was increased, while phosphorylation of JNK was decreased by the combined treatment, compared with CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment alone. In conclusion, Fen decreased apoptotic sensitivity induced by Cd in U937 cells. This effect was associated with activation of ERK and AKT, suppression of JNK and changes in expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and XIAP. The present findings suggest a potential influence of Fen on Cd toxicity via suppression of apoptosis. Fen decreased apoptotic sensitivity induced by Cd, and thus it may contribute carcinogenic risk and influence on cancer therapy.",

Despite of general chemotherapy, relapse and mortality are common, highlighting the need for the development of novel targeted drugs or combination of therapeutic regimens. Recently, several drugs that target the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, especially the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, have demonstrated notable therapeutic effects in relapsed/refractory patients, which indicate that pharmacological inhibition of BCR pathway holds promise in MCL treatment. Here, we have developed a novel irreversible BTK inhibitor, PLS-123, that has more potent and selective anti-tumor activity than ibrutinib in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro screening, we discovered that the combination of PLS-123 and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus exert synergistic activity in attenuating proliferation and motility of MCL cell lines. Simultaneous inhibition of BTK and mTOR resulted in marked induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, which were accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved PARP and Bax), repression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and XIAP), and downregulation of regulators of the G1/S phase transition (CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and Cyclin D1). Gene expression profile analysis revealed simultaneous treatment with these agents led to inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3, AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and SGK1 expression. Finally, the anti-tumor and pro-apoptotic activities of combination strategy have also been demonstrated using xenograft mice models. Taken together, simultaneous suppression of BTK and mTOR may be indicated as a potential therapeutic modality for the treatment of MCL.",

Despite their similarities, there is emerging evidence for non-redundant roles of the circulating yet scarce basophils and tissue-resident mast cells, respectively. Because of their importance in allergic pathogenesis, specific induction of apoptosis in basophils and mast cells may represent an interesting novel treatment strategy. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-3 serves as a key factor for basophil and mouse mast cell survival. Interleukin-3 increases the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, such as BCL-2, BCL-X<sub>L</sub> or MCL-1; however, little is known how strongly these individual proteins contribute to basophil survival. Here, we were applying small molecule inhibitors called BH3 mimetics, some of which show remarkable success in cancer treatments, to neutralize the function of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. We observed that expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins do not necessarily correlate with their respective importance for basophil survival. Whereas naive in vitro-differentiated mouse basophils efficiently died upon BCL-2 or BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibition, interleukin-3 priming rendered the cells highly resistant toward apoptosis, and this could only be overcome upon combined targeting of BCL-2 and BCL-X<sub>L</sub>. Of note, human basophils differed from mouse basophils as they depended on BCL-2 and MCL-1, but not on BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, for their survival at steady state. On the other hand, and in contrast to mouse basophils, MCL-1 proved critical in mediating survival of interleukin-3 stimulated mouse mast cells, whereas BCL-X<sub>L</sub> seemed dispensable. Taken together, our results indicate that by choosing the right combination of BH3 mimetic compounds, basophils and mast cells can be efficiently killed, even after stimulation with potent pro-survival cytokines such as interleukin-3. Because of the tolerable side effects of BH3 mimetics, targeting basophils or mast cells for apoptosis opens interesting possibilities for novel treatment approaches.",

Consistent with a cell-intrinsic effect, we show directly preserved HSC function resulting in a more rapid recovery of peripheral blood counts, enhanced serial transplantation capacity, and reduced myeloid skewing. When administered to healthy human volunteers, G1T28 demonstrated excellent in vivo pharmacology and transiently inhibited bone marrow (BM) HSPC proliferation.

Safety on trilaciclib+E/P was improved with fewer \u2265G3 adverse events (AEs) in trilaciclib (50%) versus placebo (83.8%), primarily due to less hematological toxicity. No trilaciclib-related \u2265G3 AEs occurred.

The wide spectrum of functional severity of CLCNKB mutations may contribute to the phenotypic variability, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. Low-level expression of the human ClC-Kb channel in mammalian cells impedes the functional study of CLCNKB mutations, and the underlying cause is still unclear. The human ClC-Kb channel is highly degraded by proteasome in human embryonic kidney cells. The C-terminal in-frame green fluorescent protein fusion may slow down the proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Barttin co-expression necessarily improves the stability, membrane trafficking and gating of ClC-Kb. CLCNKB mutations in barttin-binding sites, dimer interface or selectivity filter often have severe functional consequences. The remaining chloride conductance of the ClC-Kb mutant channel significantly correlates with the phenotypes, such as age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration, and the degree of calciuria in patients with classic BS. Mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the human voltage-gated chloride ClC-Kb (hClC-Kb) channel cause classic Bartter's syndrome (BS). In contrast to antenatal BS, classic BS manifests with highly variable phenotypes. The functional severity of the mutant channel has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Due to difficulties in the expression of hClC-Kb in heterologous expression systems, the functional consequences of mutant channels have not been thoroughly examined, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. In this study, we found that hClC-Kb, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, was unstable due to degradation by proteasome. In-frame fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of the channel may ameliorate proteasome degradation. Co-expression of barttin increased protein abundance and membrane trafficking of hClC-Kb and markedly increased functional chloride current. We then functionally characterized 18 missense mutations identified in our classic BS cohort and others using HEK cells expressing hClC-Kb-GFP. Most CLCNKB mutations resulted in marked reduction in protein abundance and chloride current, especially those residing at barttin binding sites, dimer interface and selectivity filter. We enrolled classic BS patients carrying homozygous missense mutations with well-described functional consequences and clinical presentations for genotype-phenotype analysis. We found significant correlations of mutant chloride current with the age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration and urine calcium excretion rate. In conclusion, hClC-Kb expression in HEK cells is susceptible to proteasome degradation, and fusion of GFP to the C-terminus of hClC-Kb improves protein expression. The functional severity of the CLCNKB mutation is an important determinant of the phenotype in classic BS.",

He was diagnosed as BS of unknown type at the age of 9 months and treated with indomethacin (2 mg/kg/day) and potassium chloride (KCl) supplementation (1.5 mEq/kg/day) for hypokalemia (2.5 mmol/l). At the age of 12 years, serum K+ was 3.0 mmol/l and creatinine reached 2.0 mg/dl. On admission, his blood pressure was normal but volume status was depleted. Urinalysis was essentially normal. Biochemical studies showed hypokalemia (K+ 2.4 mmol/l) with a high transtubular K+ gradient (TTKG) 9.6, metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 28.4 mmol/l), normomagnesemia (2.0 mg/dl), severe renal failure (BUN 94 mg/dl, Cr 6.3 mg/dl), and hypocalciuria (urine calcium/creatinine ratio 0.02 mg/mg). Abdominal sonography revealed bilateral small size kidneys without nephrocalcinosis or renal stones. After the withdrawal of indomethacin with regular KCl and adequate fluid supplementation for 1 year, serum creatinine and K+ levels have been maintained at 4.0 mg/dl and 3.3 mmol/l, respectively.

This G470E mutation was not identified in 100 healthy Chinese subjects. Long-term therapy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), prolonged hypokalemia, chronic volume depletion, and underlying genetic variety may contribute to the deterioration of his renal function.

Additional clinical and biochemical features led to a classification into phenotypically different tubulopathies: Gitelman's syndrome, hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (antenatal Bartter's syndrome), and classic Bartter's syndrome. Gitelman's syndrome results from mutations in the SLC12A3 gene encoding the human thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter, leading to impaired reabsorption of sodium chloride in the distal convoluted tubule. Genetic heterogeneity of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been demonstrated by identification of mutations in the SLC12A1 gene as well as in the KCNJ1 gene. Mutations in SLC12A1 coding for the bumetanide-sensitive sodium potassium 2 chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) cause defective reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Mutations in KCNJ1 leading to loss of function of the potassium channel ROMK disrupt potassium recycling back to the tubule lumen and inhibit thereby the NKCC2 activity. A third gene for hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1, and it remains to be evaluated whether other genes are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Classic Bartter's syndrome has been demonstrated to result from defective chloride transport across the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron due to mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCNKB.

Evidence has accumulated in parallel showing that lack of negative feedback of steroid hormones synthesized in ovary causes overactivation of hypertrophied kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons, located in infundibular nucleus. Oversecretion of both kisspeptin (KISS1) and neurokinin B (NKB), as well as downregulation of dynorphin, plays dominant role in creation of GnRH pulses. This in turn causes VMS. Administration of senktide, highly potent and selective NK3R agonist, resulted in increase of serum LH concentration, induction of VMS, increase in heart rate, and skin temperature in postmenopausal women. These finding suggest that modulation of KNDy neurons may become new therapeutic approach in the treatment of VMS.",

The drug has been found to have potential effects on diverse protein kinase signaling involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, either by directly inhibiting the hub kinases or by indirectly modulating marginal members in the signaling pathways. In the present study, we computationally model the kinase-chemical Interaction Profile between six OL-related chemicals (i.e. OL, OM, Valsartan [VL], Losartan [LS], Candesartan [CD] and Telmisartan [TL]) and 23 human protein kinases in atherosclerosis. The profile is analyzed systematically at molecular level to identify unexpected kinase targets for OL. There is a good consistence between co-citation frequency and affinity scoring for the chemical association with kinase candidates; the OL and its analogs VL and LS exhibit a similar binding profile to the atherosclerosis kinase spectrum. It is suggested that the Ser/Thr-specific kinases PI3K\u03b1 and ROCK1 are potential druggable targets of OL for atherosclerosis therapy. As a paradigm, kinase assays reveal that the inhibitory potency of OL and Y-27632 (positive control) on ROCK1 is determined at micromolar level, while the OM (negative control) possesses no detectable activity for the kinase.",

However, the overall molecular modulation of the reversing remodeling process in response to the ACEI or ARB treatment is not yet well determined. In this study, we examined whether gene expressions are modulated by ACEI (temocapril), ARB (olmesartan) or both in a murine model with transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and confirm whether periostin is a target gene of olmesartan in mice with myocardial infarction (MI). We detected 109 genes that were significantly up-regulated in TAC mice and a majority of these were down-regulated in response to temocapril, olmesartan or their combination which significantly attenuated cardiac remodeling at one or four weeks. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that olmesartan, temocapril or their combination down-regulated the expression of periostin. In MI mice treated with olmesartan for 4 weeks, the left ventricular end-diastolic and systolic dimensions measured with echocardiography were lower, whereas maximum rate of rise and fall rate of LV pressure (\u00b1dp/dt max) were greater, and Azan-staining cardiac fibrotic area was smaller. Furthermore, periostin was upregulated in response to MI, whereas olmesartan blocked this upregulation. Post-MI fibrosis was smaller in periostin knockout adult mice than in wildtype mice, while glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 was increased and cyclin D1 was decreased in periostin knockout mice. These findings indicate that periostin is a target gene of ARB and olmesartan reverses cardiac remodeling at least partially through the downregulation of periostin.",

One analysis pooled 1,610 patients from two 6-week randomized controlled trials to compare once daily AZL-M 40 mg, AZL-M 80 mg, OLM 40 mg, and placebo. The second analysis included 1,020 patients from a 12-week randomized controlled trial to compare once daily AZL-M/CLD 40/25 mg, AZL-M/CLD 80/25 mg, and OLM/HCTZ 40/25 mg. Efficacy end points were 24-hour mean ambulatory and clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SPB/DBP) and the percentage of patients achieving clinic SBP/DBP targets. Treatment with AZL-M 80 mg lowered mean clinic SBP by 12.5 mm Hg (p &lt;0.01 vs OLM), treatment with AZL-M/CLD 40 mg/25 mg lowered mean ambulatory SBP by 31.0 mm Hg and mean clinic SBP by 39.3 mm Hg (both p &lt;0.05 vs OLM/HCTZ), and treatment with AZL-M/CLD 80 mg/25 mg lowered mean ambulatory SBP by 34.4 mm Hg (p &lt;0.01 vs OLM/HCTZ) and mean clinic SBP by 39.2 mm Hg (p &lt;0.05 vs OLM/HCTZ). Target BP goals were achieved more frequently with AZL-M versus OLM and with AZL-M/CLD versus OLM/HCTZ. In conclusion, in both black and white patients, BP was lowered more effectively with AZL-M versus OLM and with AZL-M/CLD versus OLM/HCTZ.

SLE prevalence is also elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the <i>TLR7</i> gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of <i>TLR7</i> allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express <i>TLR7</i> on both X chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater <i>TLR7</i> transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of CD27<sup>+</sup> plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. <i>TLR7</i> escape from X inactivation endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This finding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to biallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune disorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.",

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) release IFN-alpha upon TLR7 and TLR9 ligation. With respect to the nine times higher incidence of SLE in women and the clinical use of synthetic TLR ligands as novel immune adjuvants, we analyzed IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha production in healthy human individuals. Blood samples were incubated with synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. In three independent groups (n(1) = 120, n(2) = 101, and n(3) = 123), analysis revealed a capacity of female PBLs to produce significantly higher IFN-alpha levels after TLR7 stimulation (p(1) &lt; 0.0000001, p(2) &lt; 0.0000001, and p(3) &lt; 0.0001) compared with male PBLs. In contrast, no sex differences were evident after TLR9 stimulation. TNF-alpha production after TLR7 stimulation and also total pDC numbers were not different between females and males. X-inactivation escape of the TLR7 gene was investigated in monoclonal B cell lines and, independently, in pDCs after cell sorting and single-cell picking, indicating regular silencing of one TLR7 allele in females. Additionally, exogenous 17beta-estrogen and estrogen receptor antagonism did not indicate a significant role on TLR7-induced IFN-alpha production. Our data reveal for the first time a profound sex-dependent pathway of TLR7-induced IFN-alpha with higher production in females. These findings may explain the higher prevalence of SLE in females and the reported decreased therapeutic efficacy of synthetic TLR7 ligands in male individuals.",

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B cells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven functional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the enhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent autoimmune syndromes.",

In many parts of the world cholera is still endemic, causing outbreaks and constituting repeatedly serious public health problems. The oral live cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR (Orochol, Mutachol), the first genetically modified organism (GMO) used as vaccine, was in its time (launched 1993, Switzerland) the ideal cholera vaccine: single-dose, protective efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus, demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10, 2016). What had happened?

However, analyses of their RNA and DNA profiles are challenging, because they comprise reads not only from the grafted human cancer but also from the murine host. The reads of murine origin result in false positives in mutation analysis of DNA samples and obscure gene expression levels when sequencing RNA. However, currently available algorithms are limited and improvements in accuracy and ease of use are necessary. We developed the R-package XenofilteR, which separates mouse from human sequence reads based on the edit-distance between a sequence read and reference genome. To assess the accuracy of XenofilteR, we generated sequence data by in silico mixing of mouse and human DNA sequence data. These analyses revealed that XenofilteR removes &gt; 99.9% of sequence reads of mouse origin while retaining human sequences. This allowed for mutation analysis of xenograft samples with accurate variant allele frequencies, and retrieved all non-synonymous somatic tumor mutations.

There is no correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This lack of correlation is often referred to as 'Peto's Paradox'. Here, we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene <i>TP53</i> and that the increase in <i>TP53</i> copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore, we show that several of the <i>TP53</i> retrogenes (<i>TP53RTGs</i>) are transcribed and likely translated. While <i>TP53RTGs</i> do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of <i>TP53</i> may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Peto's paradox in Proboscideans.",

To identify mechanisms for cancer resistance in elephants and compare cellular response to DNA damage among elephants, healthy human controls, and cancer-prone patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). A comprehensive survey of necropsy data was performed across 36 mammalian species to validate cancer resistance in large and long-lived organisms, including elephants (n = 644). The African and Asian elephant genomes were analyzed for potential mechanisms of cancer resistance. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from elephants, healthy human controls, and patients with LFS were tested in vitro in the laboratory for DNA damage response. The study included African and Asian elephants (n = 8), patients with LFS (n = 10), and age-matched human controls (n = 11). Human samples were collected at the University of Utah between June 2014 and July 2015. Ionizing radiation and doxorubicin. Cancer mortality across species was calculated and compared by body size and life span. The elephant genome was investigated for alterations in cancer-related genes. DNA repair and apoptosis were compared in elephant vs human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Across mammals, cancer mortality did not increase with body size and/or maximum life span (eg, for rock hyrax, 1% [95% CI, 0%-5%]; African wild dog, 8% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; lion, 2% [95% CI, 0%-7%]). Despite their large body size and long life span, elephants remain cancer resistant, with an estimated cancer mortality of 4.81% (95% CI, 3.14%-6.49%), compared with humans, who have 11% to 25% cancer mortality. While humans have 1 copy (2 alleles) of TP53, African elephants have at least 20 copies (40 alleles), including 19 retrogenes (38 alleles) with evidence of transcriptional activity measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In response to DNA damage, elephant lymphocytes underwent p53-mediated apoptosis at higher rates than human lymphocytes proportional to TP53 status (ionizing radiation exposure: patients with LFS, 2.71% [95% CI, 1.93%-3.48%] vs human controls, 7.17% [95% CI, 5.91%-8.44%] vs elephants, 14.64% [95% CI, 10.91%-18.37%]; P &lt; .001; doxorubicin exposure: human controls, 8.10% [95% CI, 6.55%-9.66%] vs elephants, 24.77% [95% CI, 23.0%-26.53%]; P &lt; .001). Compared with other mammalian species, elephants appeared to have a lower-than-expected rate of cancer, potentially related to multiple copies of TP53. Compared with human cells, elephant cells demonstrated increased apoptotic response following DNA damage.

Technosphere insulin appears to overcome some of the barriers that contributed to the market withdrawal of Exubera by the manufacturer. Studies with Technosphere insulin have shown it to be a unique insulin formulation in that it is very rapid acting, has a relatively short duration of action, and is efficacious in terms of improved glycemic control without contributing to increased weight gain or the incidence of hypoglycemia when compared with other prandial insulin products.

Recently, Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance. However, Deep Learning has not yet been applied to drug synergy prediction, which is the approach we present here, termed DeepSynergy. DeepSynergy uses chemical and genomic information as input information, a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity, and conical layers to model drug synergies. DeepSynergy was compared to other machine learning methods such as Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Elastic Nets on the largest publicly available synergy dataset with respect to mean squared error. DeepSynergy significantly outperformed the other methods with an improvement of 7.2% over the second best method at the prediction of novel drug combinations within the space of explored drugs and cell lines. At this task, the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the measured and the predicted values of DeepSynergy was 0.73. Applying DeepSynergy for classification of these novel drug combinations resulted in a high predictive performance of an AUC of 0.90. Furthermore, we found that all compared methods exhibit low predictive performance when extrapolating to unexplored drugs or cell lines, which we suggest is due to limitations in the size and diversity of the dataset.

The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in an interactive and user-friendly interface. easyGWAS is also a public data repository for GWAS data and summary statistics and already includes published data and results from several major GWAS. We demonstrate the potential of easyGWAS with a case study of the model organism <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, using flowering and growth-related traits.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29280411": " Synovial Sarcoma (SS) and Myxoid Round Cell Liposarcoma (MRCL) are devastating sarcoma subtypes with few treatment options and poor outcomes in the advanced setting. However, both these diseases may be ideal for novel immunotherapies targeting the cancer-testis antigen, NY-ESO-1. In this review, we discuss the novel NY-ESO-1 targeted vaccine regimen, CMB305. This regimen uses a unique integration-deficient, dendritic-cell targeting lentiviral vector from the ZVex\u00ae platform, LV305, in order to prime NY-ESO-1 specific T cells. LV305 has single agent activity, and, in one case, caused a durable partial response in a refractory SS patient. CMB305 also includes a boost from a NY-ESO-1 protein vaccine given along with a potent toll-like-4 receptor agonist, glycopyranosyl lipid A. CMB305 induces NY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses in both SS and MRC patients and these patients had excellent overall survival (OS) outcomes in the initial phase I study. CMB305 is a therapeutic vaccine regimen targeting NY-ESO-1 based on the lentiviral vaccine vector, LV305. Phase I studies have proven this vaccine is active immunologically. Data suggesting this vaccine may improve OS for SS and MRCL patients is exciting but early, and on-going work is testing the impact of CMB305 on patient outcomes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27069343": " Vaccinations in school-aged children are required by state and local law to maintain high vaccination coverage rates, as well as low rates of vaccine-preventable diseases. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are childhood diseases that can be life threatening; poliomyelitis, another childhood disease, can be disabling. In turn, vaccinations were developed to provide protection against these diseases. Today, several vaccinations are recommended for children, including but not limited to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) and poliomyelitis (IPV). DTaP requires five doses, and IPV requires four. Quadracel (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed and inactivated poliovirus vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) is a new vaccination developed to condense the last dose of both DTaP and IPV so they do not have to be given separately, thus reducing the total number of vaccinations required. The Quadracel vaccine is an option for use in children who are completing the DTaP and IPV series. In a randomized, controlled, phase 3, pivotal trial, Quadracel proved to be as efficacious and safe as Daptacel (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) and IPOL (poliovirus vaccine inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.), given separately, to children between the ages of 4 and 6 years. Quadracel should be recommended to parents who have children between the ages of 4 and 6 years who meet the necessary administration criteria and need to finalize their DTaP and IPV series. Quadracel's administration in the vaccination series replaces one additional injection, which may benefit children who are afraid of receiving shots and parents who need to schedule one less doctor's appointment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12615004": "The mouse Fxy gene was translocated into the highly recombining pseudoautosomal region comparatively recently in evolutionary terms. This event resulted in a rapid increase of GC content. We investigated the consequences of the translocation further by sequencing exons and introns of Fxy in various rodent species. We found that the DNA fragment newly located in a highly recombining context has acquired every property of a GC-rich isochore, namely increased GC content (especially at the third codon positions of exons), shorter introns and high density of minisatellites. These results strongly suggest that recombination is the primary determinant of the isochore organization of mammalian genomes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17418442": "The analysis of evolutionary rates is a popular approach to characterizing the effect of natural selection at the molecular level. Sequences contributing to species adaptation are expected to evolve faster than nonfunctional sequences because favourable mutations have a higher fixation probability than neutral ones. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gene. Several criteria can discriminate between the natural selection and biased gene conversion models. These criteria suggest that the recently reported human accelerated regions are most likely the result of biased gene conversion. We argue that these regions, far from contributing to human adaptation, might represent the Achilles' heel of our genome.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375121": "The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) at the terminus of the short and the long arms, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2. The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes. During a copy number variation screen, we noted a paternally inherited chromosome X duplication in 15 independent families. Subsequent genomic analysis demonstrated that an insertional translocation of X chromosomal sequence into the Y chromosome generates an extended PAR [corrected].The insertion is generated by non-allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat within the Y chromosome PAR1 and a second LTR6B repeat located 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome. The identification of the reciprocal deletion on the X chromosome in one family and the occurrence of the variant in different chromosome Y haplogroups demonstrate this is a recurrent genomic rearrangement in the human population. This finding represents a novel mechanism shaping sex chromosomal evolution.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18660847": "The pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) of the human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine during meiosis. Thus genes in this region are not inherited in a strictly sex-linked fashion. PAR1 is located at the terminal region of the short arms and PAR2 at the tips of the long arms of these chromosomes. To date, 24 genes have been assigned to the PAR1 region. Half of these have a known function. In contrast, so far only 4 genes have been discovered in the PAR2 region. Deletion of the PAR1 region results in failure of pairing and male sterility. The gene SHOX (short stature homeobox-containing) resides in PAR1. SHOX haploinsufficiency contributes to certain features in Turner syndrome as well as the characteristics of Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis. Only two of the human PAR1 genes have mouse homologues. These do not, however, reside in the mouse PAR1 region but are autosomal. The PAR regions seem to be relics of differential additions, losses, rearrangements and degradation of the X and Y chromosome in different mammalian lineages. Marsupials have three homologues of human PAR1 genes in their autosomes, although, in contrast to mouse, do not have a PAR region at all. The disappearance of PAR from other species seems likely and this region will only be rescued by the addition of genes to both X and Y, as has occurred already in lemmings. The present review summarizes the current understanding of the evolution of PAR and provides up-to-date information about individual genes residing in this region.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12566406": "The 320-kb human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) at the tips of the long arms of the X and Y chromosomes is thought to have been duplicated onto the Y chromosome recently in primate evolution. The four genes within PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X chromosome. To test this hypothesis, we cloned and mapped PAR2 genes in other species, the lemur, the cat, and a marsupial, the tammar wallaby. None of the human PAR2 genes colocalized with human PAR1 genes in the marsupial genome, confirming that the human PAR1 and PAR2 evolved independently. Of the four PAR2 genes, only SYBL1 was located on the X chromosome in all species, including marsupials, so it was part of the ancient X. HSPRY3 localized to the X in all the eutherians, but not marsupial, so it must have been added to the X 80-130 million years ago. CXYorf1 was present on the X in primates and also in mouse, but autosomal in wallaby, suggesting a later addition 70-130 million years ago, and IL9R was on the X only in primate, suggesting addition 60-70 million years ago. The results therefore demonstrate that at least two independent additions were necessary for PAR2 evolution. The present gene order on the human X also requires two inversions. The complicated evolutionary pathway supports the hypothesis that terminal interchromosomal rearrangements are common in regions unpaired at meiosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2847916": "A physical map of the human pseudoautosomal region has been constructed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and the infrequently cutting restriction enzymes BssHIII, EagI, SstII, NotI, MluI and NruI. This map extends 2.3 Mbp from the telomere to sex-chromosome-specific DNA, includes at least seven CpG islands and locates four genetically mapped loci. Five of the CpG islands are organized into two clusters. One cluster is adjacent to the telomere, the other extends into sex-chromosome-specific DNA. There is congruence between the genetic and physical maps which implies that the frequency of recombination is approximately uniform throughout the DNA."
