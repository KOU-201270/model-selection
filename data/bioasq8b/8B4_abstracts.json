Permanent MCAO results in a modest neutrophil infiltration at 24 h after ischaemia, predominantly around arterial vessels at the margins of infarction, whereas MCAO with subsequent reperfusion is associated with substantial infiltration by neutrophils throughout the entire infarct. Several studies show that C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, is associated with stroke outcomes and future vascular events. Several drugs, especially hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), have been demonstrated to reduce hsCRP levels independently of their effects on plasma cholesterol. Various cytokines were shown to be expressed in the injured brain. Recent investigations demonstrated that mRNAs of above cytokines were induced in the ischemic rat brain. TNF-alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates key roles in many physiological and pathological cellular processes including acute and chronic inflammation, programmed cell death or apoptosis, anti-tumor responses, and infection. Pharmaceutical industry to search a small molecule TNF inhibitor have taken multiple strategies. Significant protection after in vivo oral use of SB-239063 from brain injury and neurological deficits was observed in one study. In the same study significant protection from brain injury and neurological deficits was also demonstrated due to i.v post-stroke treatment with the same compound. Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion process consists of several steps, beginning with rolling of the leukocyte on the endothelial surface until it has slowed down to such a degree that it sticks to the endothelium. Treatment with a murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody (enlimomab) has been investigated in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial (EAST). Unfortunately, the case fatality rate in this trial was significantly higher in the enlimomab patient group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, experimental data have shown that focal cerebral ischemia induces a time-dependent activation of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Dissipation of ATP by CD39 reduced P2X7 receptor stimulation and thereby suppressed baseline leukocyte alphaMbeta2-integrin expression. As alphaMbeta2-integrin blockade reversed the postischemic, inflammatory phenotype of Cd39-/- mice, these data suggest that phosphohydrolytic activity on the leukocyte surface suppresses cell-cell interactions that would otherwise promote thrombosis or inflammation.",

The phenomenon of the \"ischemic cascade\" has been described, and each step along this cascade provides a target for therapeutic intervention. A wide variety of drugs have been studied in humans. Ten classes of neuroprotective agents have reached phase III efficacy trials but have shown mixed results. They included calcium channel antagonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, lubeluzole, CDP-choline, the free radical scavenger tirilazad and ebselen, enlimomab, GABA agonist clomethiazole, the sodium channel antagonist fosphenytoin, magnesium, glycine site antagonist GV150526 and piracetam.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11692032": " Enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter acute-stroke trial. We did a bedside-to-bench study in standardized rat stroke models to explore mechanisms for these untoward results. After focal brain ischemia in Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we administered murine anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody (1A29), subclass-matched murine immunoglobulin (IgG1), or vehicle intravenously. To examine whether rat anti-mouse antibodies were generated against the mouse protein and whether these were deleterious, we sensitized Wistar rats with 1A29 or vehicle 7 days before surgery. Infarct volume, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, neutrophil CD11b expression, and microvascular E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 expression were examined 48 hours after surgery. Complement activation was serially assessed for 2 hours after a single injection of either 1A29 or vehicle. 1A29 treatment did not significantly reduce infarct size in either strain. 1A29 sensitization augmented infarct size and generated rat anti-mouse antibodies. Although 1A29 inhibited neutrophil trafficking shown by reduction in brain myeloperoxidase activity, circulating neutrophils were activated and displayed CD11b upregulation. Complement was activated in 1A29-sensitized Wistar rats and 1A29-treated SHR. E-selectin (SHR), endothelial P-selectin (Wistar and SHR), and ICAM-1 (SHR) were upregulated in animals treated with 1A29. Administration to rats of a murine antibody preparation against ICAM-1, 1A29, elicits the production of host antibodies against the protein, activation of circulating neutrophils, complement activation, and sustained microvascular activation. These observations provide several possible mechanisms for central nervous system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when Enlimomab was given in acute ischemic stroke.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11673584": " There has been recent interest in the possible role of reperfusion-induced inflammation with neuronal injury after stroke. Enlimomab, a murine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibody, reduces leukocyte adhesion and infarct size in experimental stroke studies. The purpose of the current clinical trial was to evaluate the use of enlimomab after ischemic stroke. A total of 625 patients with ischemic stroke were randomized to receive either enlimomab (n = 317) or placebo (n = 308) within 6 hours of stroke onset. Treatment was given over 5 days. Patients were evaluated at baseline and on days 5 and 90 after initiation of treatment; long-term assessments were carried out after 6 and 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the response to therapy at 90 days on the Modified Rankin Scale; other endpoints included Barthel Index (BI) and NIH Stroke Scale and survival. At day 90, the Modified Rankin Scale score was worse in patients treated with enlimomab than with placebo (p = 0.004). Fewer patients had symptom-free recovery on enlimomab than placebo (p = 0.004), and more died (22.2 versus 16.2%). The negative effect of enlimomab was apparent on days 5, 30, and 90 of treatment (p = 0.005). There were significantly more adverse events with enlimomab treatment than placebo, primarily infections and fever. Patients experiencing fever were more likely to have a poor outcome or die. The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9744839": "A growing body of evidence, primarily from animal models of cerebral ischemia and preliminary human studies, indicates that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to secondary neuronal injury after acute cerebral ischemia. Ischemia followed by reperfusion rapidly leads to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, which stimulate a complex cascade of events involving local endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and perivascular cells. A secondary response includes the release of other cytokines, an increase in components of the coagulation system, an upregulation of cell adhesion molecule expression, and changes in the expression of components of the immune response. The net effect of these events is transformation of the local endothelium to a prothrombotic/proinflammatory state and induction of leukocyte migration to the site of injury. A number of studies have shown that leukocyte migration occurs within hours of reperfusion. Leukocytes accumulate in the injured region, where they cause tissue injury by several mechanisms, including occlusion of microvasculature, generation of oxygen free radicals, release of cytotoxic enzymes, alteration of vasomotor reactivity, and increase in cytokine and chemoattractant release. Monoclonal antibodies against leukocyte adhesion molecules have been shown to reduce infarct volume in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion. However, this treatment failed to show benefit in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial. A number of factors may complicate the use of antibody directed adhesion molecule blockade in acute stroke and will be discussed in this article. Overall, an increased understanding of inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms still offers great potential for reducing acute stroke injury.",

An open, uncontrolled, dose titration study was conducted in 32 patients hospitalized for stroke. Patients received one of four fixed dose regimens of enlimomab. A loading dose of enlimomab administered within 24 h of the onset of stroke symptoms was followed by four daily maintenance doses; total doses ranged from 140 to 480 mg. The pharmacokinetic target levels (enlimomab serum levels of &gt;/=10 microg/ml) were consistently achieved in all patients receiving dose regimens III and IV. Non-serious adverse events thought to be causally related to enlimomab administration included headache, vomiting and extrasystoles. Serious events occurred in 14 patients, including pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest. The only serious adverse event considered to be related to enlimomab administration was an anaphylactoid reaction, in a patient who received an unfiltered loading dose of antibody; the patient recovered. The overall mortality in the study was 15.6% and the 30-day mortality was 12.5%. There was no increase in the frequency of adverse events with increasing doses of enlimomab. Doses of enlimomab between 140 and 480 mg administered over 5 days did not increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke during an observation period of 30 +/- 10 days. A loading dose of 160 mg followed by four daily maintenance doses of 40 mg appears to be suitable for further study.",

Herein, we present a rare case of a patient diagnosed with Alport syndrome and bilateral giant macular holes. A 40-year-old woman with a previously unreported mutation in the COL4A4 gene suggestive of autosomal-recessive Alport syndrome presented at our department. The patient exhibited bilateral full-thickness macular holes measuring &gt;1500 \u00b5m at their smallest diameters. The very large dimensions of both macular holes were indicative of a bad prognosis regarding hole closure, and a conservative approach was adopted. The patient was maintained on renal substitution therapy, and genetic counseling was offered to other family members. Ophthalmological findings associated to Alport syndrome commonly include anterior lenticonus and dot-and-fleck retinopathy, although giant macular holes can also be associated with this condition. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial in the management of these patients, as Alport syndrome is an inherited systemic basement membrane disease.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398087": " Collagen type IV related nephropathies are due to the defects in collagen IV genes COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 and comprise a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from Alport Syndrome (AS) to its mild variants, termed as familial haematuria or thin basement membrane nephropathy. Classical AS is a progressive renal disease presenting with a triad of progressive hematuric nephritis and typical extra-renal complications, such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and variable ocular anomalies. The mode of inheritance in AS is X-linked in 85%, autosomal recessive in 15%, and autosomal dominant in rare cases. This study aims to identify underlying mutation in multiple individuals from a large consanguineous Saudi family with inherited nephropathy, including our index patient who manifested all the features of classical AS. Patients were diagnosed by nephrologists and clinical geneticists. All the individuals underwent clinical, audiological and ophthalmological evaluation. Blood samples were collected after written informed consent. DNA extraction, homozygosity mapping and PCR amplification followed standard methodologies. The disease locus was mapped to 2q36.3, where both COL4A3 and COL4A4 reside. Sanger sequencing of COL4A3 and COL4A4 revealed an underlying novel homozygous disease-causing COL4A4 mutation (c.2420delG; p.G807fsX60) in the affected proband. Considerable phenotypic variability segregating with this COL4A4 mutation in our study family is documented. The homozygous mutants were manifesting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in their adolescence, while the heterozygous carrier members were presenting with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity ranging from intermittent hematuria to late onset ESRD. In addition, there is a relatively severe involvement of the ear (SNHL) and eye in the homozygotes than the heterozygotes. Fertility problems were also noted in both of the homozygous females. Identification of the causative mutation is an efficient strategy for conclusive molecular diagnosis in the patients and to establish genotype/phenotype correlation. It is important to study and evaluate asymptomatic carriers, to predict prognosis of the disease and to obviate the need for another renal biopsy in at-risk related family members. While an accurate genetic diagnosis of AS provides valuable information for genetic counseling in the extended family members, it can also facilitate future prenatal diagnosis and planning for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.",

Alport first published his description of a triad of symptoms in a family with hereditary congenital haemorrhagic nephritis, deafness and ocular changes. A few years after his death, this group of symptoms was renamed Alport syndrome. To this day, Alport syndrome still inevitably leads to end-stage renal disease and the need for renal replacement therapy, starting in young adulthood. During the past two decades, research into this rare disease has focused on the effects of mutations in collagen type IV and the role of changes in podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane that lead to early kidney fibrosis. Animal models of Alport syndrome also demonstrate the pathogenetic importance of interactions between podocytes and the extracellular matrix. Such models might also help researchers to answer basic questions about podocyte function and the development of fibrosis, and to develop new therapeutic approaches that might be of use in other kidney diseases. In this Review, we discuss the latest basic and clinical research on Alport syndrome, focusing on the roles of podocyte pathology and the extracellular matrix. We also highlight early diagnosis and treatment options for young patients with this disorder.",

Ultrastructural findings in the lens capsule and in the renal glomeruli have provided evidence that abnormal basement membranes are elaborated in affected tissues of patients with this disorder. Recently, the results of several linkage studies have allowed the genetic defect in Alport syndrome to be mapped to a locus that codes for a subtype of type IV collagen (alpha 5) known to be present in glomerular basement membranes. In spite of these advances, the nature of the retinal flecks in Alport syndrome and the visual consequences of the flecks remain controversial. Detailed psychophysical and electrophysiologic testing was performed in a young man with Alport syndrome. The concurrence of an unusually extensive fleck retinopathy and unilateral pseudophakia afforded a unique opportunity to assess the effect of the flecks on retinal function. No sensory deficits were present in the eye with clear media. Macular flecks in Alport syndrome are not associated with demonstrable retinal dysfunction.

New signs have been described which can be useful both for diagnosis and for prognosticating the risk of complications. This study examines and describes a triad comprising the unusual 'stair-case' foveal sign, together with choroidal thinning and late-stage peripheral schisis in a patient with Alport syndrome. This is a case report of a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a background of X-linked Alport syndrome presenting with gradual and progressive diminution of vision in the left eye with a central blur. He had already undergone three renal allografts, was deaf and suffered from hypertension by the time of his first presentation to ophthalmology. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 6/9.5 in the right eye and 6/30 in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography imaging showed an unusual 'stair-case' sign of the fovea in both eyes, together with choroidal thinning. We postulate that an abnormal vitreomacular interface followed by vitreomacular traction and eventually separation, removing layers of the inner retina with the vitreous, led to this unusual appearance. Subsequently, this patient also developed schitic changes more peripherally in the retina which progressed over the following 5 years. The stair-case foveal sign, choroidal thinning and mid-peripheral schisis are three signs that clinicians might expect to encounter on optical coherence tomography imaging of patients with Alport syndrome. These findings can be attributed to unique mutations of collagen IV which lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes affecting basement membrane structures. Identification of these features may not only be useful diagnostically and in forecasting complications such as macular holes, but also predict mode of inheritance and likelihood of early-onset renal failure.",

She subsequently showed proteinuria and hematuria. She underwent splenectomy and renal biopsy on August 12, 1992. The glomeruli appeared to be almost normal under light microscopy. The interstitium showed regional fibrosis containing foam cells and the renal tubuli showed mild atrophy. Under electronmicroscopy, the basement membrane of the glomeruli was associated with mesangial interposition and the lamina densa was split into several layers.

Here, by analyzing large expression profiles of human breast cancer cells, we found an extraordinary correlation between the expression of Grainyhead transcription factor Grhl2 and epithelial marker E-cadherin. Knockdown of Grhl2 expression by shRNA in human mammary epithelial cell MCF10A leads to down-regulation of E-cadherin and EMT. Grhl2 is down-regulated in disseminated cancer cells that have undergone EMT, and over-expression of Grhl2 is sufficient to induce epithelial gene expression. Large clinical datasets reveal that expression of Grhl2 is significantly associated with poor relapse free survival and increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer patients. In mouse models, over-expression of Grhl2 significantly promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Further testing of several Grhl2 regulated genes leads to the same conclusions that the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of tumor cells are linked to epithelial phenotype but not mesenchymal phenotype. In conclusion, our findings indicate that Grhl2 plays an essential role in the determination of epithelial phenotype of breast cancers, EMT and tumor progression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23814079": "Using a retrovirus-mediated cDNA expression cloning approach, we identified the grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) transcription factor as novel protooncogene. Overexpression of GRHL2 in NIH3T3 cells induced striking morphological changes, an increase in cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor growth in vivo. By combining a microarray analysis and a phylogenetic footprinting analysis with various biochemical assays, we identified the epidermal growth factor receptor family member Erbb3 as a novel GRHL2 target gene. In breast cancer cell lines, shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRHL2 expression or functional inactivation of GRHL2 using dominant negative GRHL2 proteins induces down-regulation of ERBB3 gene expression, a striking reduction in cell proliferation, and morphological and phenotypical alterations characteristic of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus implying contradictory roles of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis. Interestingly, we could further demonstrate that expression of GRHL2 is directly suppressed by the transcription factor zinc finger enhancer-binding protein 1 (ZEB1), which in turn is a direct target for repression by GRHL2, suggesting that the EMT transcription factors GRHL2 and ZEB1 form a double negative regulatory feedback loop in breast cancer cells. Finally, a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers showed loss of GRHL2 expression at the invasive front of primary tumors. A pathophysiological relevance of GRHL2 in breast cancer metastasis is further demonstrated by our finding of a statistically significant association between loss of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers and lymph node metastasis. We thus demonstrate a crucial role of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27402864": "Phenotypic plasticity involves a process in which cells transiently acquire phenotypic traits of another lineage. Two commonly studied types of phenotypic plasticity are epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). In carcinomas, EMT drives invasion and metastatic dissemination, while MET is proposed to play a role in metastatic colonization. Phenotypic plasticity in sarcomas is not well studied; however, there is evidence that a subset of sarcomas undergo an MET-like phenomenon. While the exact mechanisms by which these transitions occur remain largely unknown, it is likely that some of the same master regulators that drive EMT and MET in carcinomas also act in sarcomas. In this study, we combined mathematical models with bench experiments to identify a core regulatory circuit that controls MET in sarcomas. This circuit comprises the microRNA 200 (miR-200) family, ZEB1, and GRHL2. Interestingly, combined expression of miR-200s and GRHL2 further upregulates epithelial genes to induce MET. This effect is phenocopied by downregulation of either ZEB1 or the ZEB1 cofactor, BRG1. In addition, an MET gene expression signature is prognostic for improved overall survival in sarcoma patients. Together, our results suggest that a miR-200, ZEB1, GRHL2 gene regulatory network may drive sarcoma cells to a more epithelial-like state and that this likely has prognostic relevance.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26887977": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biological process by which polarized epithelial cells convert into a mesenchymal phenotype, has been implicated to contribute to the molecular heterogeneity of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Here we report that a transcription factor--Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) maintains the epithelial phenotype. EOC tumours with lower GRHL2 levels are associated with the Mes/Mesenchymal molecular subtype and a poorer overall survival. shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRHL2 in EOC cells with an epithelial phenotype results in EMT changes, with increased cell migration, invasion and motility. By ChIP-sequencing and gene expression microarray, microRNA-200b/a is identified as the direct transcriptional target of GRHL2 and regulates the epithelial status of EOC through ZEB1 and E-cadherin. Our study demonstrates that loss of GRHL2 increases the levels of histone mark H3K27me3 on promoters and GRHL2-binding sites at miR-200b/a and E-cadherin genes. These findings support GRHL2 as a pivotal gatekeeper of EMT in EOC via miR-200-ZEB1.",

We explored the role of grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), a suppressor of EMT, in the progression of PDAC. Expressions of GRHL2 were assessed using surgically resected PDAC tissues by immunohistochemistry analysis, and in vitro using human and mouse PDAC cells. Effects on epithelial plasticity and stemness of GRHL2 were examined in vitro using liver metastatic PDAC cells (CFPAC-1) with GRHL2 knockdown by specific siRNAs. GRHL2 has a significantly positive correlation with E-cadherin and CD133 in 155 resected human primary PDAC tissues. GRHL2 is highly expressed in liver metastatic cells than in primary invasive cells of both human and mouse PDAC, accompanied by a positive correlation with E-cadherin expression. GRHL2 knockdown CFPAC-1 cells demonstrated morphological changes into mesenchymal appearances and reduced proliferation through EMT. Notably, knockdown studies followed by flow cytometry analysis for a subpopulation of CD133+ showed that GRHL2 facilitates CFPAC-1 cells to maintain stem-like characters including self-renewal capacity and anoikis resistance. GRHL2 regulates epithelial plasticity along with stemness in PDAC, both of which are crucial for metastasis, implicating the possibility of GRHL2 as a therapeutic target for PDAC liver metastasis.",

Although GRHL2 recently has attracted considerable interest in that it could be identified as a novel suppressor of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, evidence is emerging that GRHL2 also exhibits tumour-promoting activities. Aim of the present study therefore was to help defining the relevance of GRHL2 for human cancers by performing a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of GRHL2 expression in normal (n = 608) and (n = 3,143) tumour tissues using tissue microarrays. Consistent with its accepted role in epithelial morphogenesis, GRHL2 expression preferentially but not exclusively was observed in epithelial cells. Regenerative and proliferating epithelial cells with stem cell features showed a strong GRHL2 expression. Highly complex GRHL2 expression patterns indicative of both reduced and elevated GRHL2 expression in tumours, possibly reflecting potential tumour-suppressing as well as oncogenic functions of GRHL2 in distinct human tumours, were observed. A dysregulation of GRHL2 expression for the first time was found in tumours of non-epithelial origin (e.g., astrocytomas, melanomas). We also report GRHL2 copy number gains which, however, did not necessarily translate into increased GRHL2 expression levels in cancer cells. Results obtained by meta-analysis of gene expression microarray data in conjunction with functional assays demonstrating a direct regulation of HER3 expression further point to a potential therapeutic relevance of GRHL2 in ovarian cancer. Hopefully, the results presented in this study may pave the way for a better understanding of the yet largely unknown function of GRHL2 in the initiation, progression and also therapy of cancers.",

Recent studies have shown that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely related to the invasion and migration of cancer cells. Grainyhead-like 2 (Grhl2), a transcription factor, has been reported to be associated with several tumor processes including EMT. In the previous study, we have reported that Grhl2 functioned as a tumor suppressor in proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer. Here we aim to explore the effects of Grhl2 on invasion and migration of gastric cancer and further clarify its possible underlying mechanisms. As a result, in both SGC7901 and MKN45 cells, Grhl2 overexpression significantly inhibited the ability of invasion and migration. In addition, preliminary experiments showed that Grhl2 reduces the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, -7 and -9 (MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9). Most importantly, Grhl2 antagonizes transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2)-induced EMT, and inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways can restore Grhl2 expression. Finally, the results of subcutaneous xenograft model indicated that Grhl2 suppresses the growth of gastric cancer and reverses EMT process in vivo. Meanwhile, the metastatic tumor model further confirmed the inhibition of Grhl2 on metastasis of gastric cancer. Taken together, our findings proved that Grhl2, functioned as a tumor suppressor, reduces the invasion and migration through inhibition of TGF\u03b2-induced EMT in gastric cancer.",

Annular closure devices such as the Barricaid system aim to improve outcome after lumbar discectomy by reducing the risk of recurrent disc herniation of the same level.

Several prosthesis and techniques to reduce re-herniation have been proposed including implantation of an annular closure device (ACD) - Barricaid\u2122 and an annular tissue repair system (AR) - Anulex-Xclose\u2122. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assist surgeons determine a potential approach to reduce incidences of recurrent lumbar disc herniation and assess the current devices regarding their outcomes and complications. Four electronic full-text databases were systematically searched through September 2017. Data including outcomes of annular closure device/annular repair were extracted. All results were pooled utilising meta-analysis with weighted mean difference and odds ratio as summary statistics. Four studies met inclusion criteria. Three studies reported the use of Barricaid (ACD) while one study reported the use of Anulex (AR). A total of 24 symptomatic reherniation were reported among 811 discectomies with ACD/AR as compared to 51 out of 645 in the control group (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.20,0.56; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; P &lt; 0.0001). Durotomies were lower among the ACD/AR patients with only 3 reported cases compared to 7 in the control group (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.13, 2.23; I<sup>2</sup> = 11%; P = 0.39). Similar outcomes for post-operative Oswestry Disability Index and visual analogue scale were obtained when both groups were compared. Early results showed the use of Barricaid and Anulex devices are beneficial for short term outcomes demonstrating reduction in symptomatic disc reherniation with low post-operative complication rates. Long-term studies are required to further investigate the efficacy of such devices.",

The aim of this article is to demonstrate the opportunities of surgical treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniation involving annuloplasty using the Barricaid closure device as the final stage and the ways to resolve possible complications requiring reoperation. Searching for the most effective methods for preventing recurrent disc herniation is far from being completed; the need for improving methods and techniques of surgical treatment of this pathology is still topical.

To evaluate whether an annular closure device could be implanted safely to reduce same-level recurrent disk herniation, or attenuate disk height loss and improve the outcome after lumbar discectomy. Same-level recurrent disk herniation, disk height loss, and progressive degeneration are common complications and sequelae after lumbar discectomy. Techniques to reduce these consequences may improve outcomes. Forty-six consecutive patients undergoing lumbar discectomy for single-level herniated disk at 2 institutions were followed prospectively with clinical and radiographic evaluations at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (control cohort). A second consecutive cohort of 30 patients undergoing 31 lumbar discectomies with implantation of an annular closure device was followed similarly. Incidence of recurrent disk herniation, disk height loss, the leg and back pain visual analog scale (VAS), and the Oswestry Disability Index were assessed at each follow-up. Cohorts were well matched at baseline. By 2 years of follow-up, symptomatic recurrent same-level disk herniation occurred in 3 (6.5%) patients in the control cohort versus 0 (0%) patients in the annular repair cohort (P=0.27). A trend of greater preservation of disk height was observed in the annular repair versus the control cohort 3 months (7.9 vs. 7.27 mm, P=0.08), 6 months (7.81 vs. 7.18 mm, P=0.09), and 12 months (7.63 vs. 6.9 mm, P=0.06) postoperatively. The annular closure cohort reported less leg pain (VAS-LP: 5 vs. 16, P&lt;0.01), back pain (VAS-BP: 13 vs. 22, P&lt;0.05), and disability (Oswestry Disability Index: 16 vs. 22, P&lt;0.05) 1 year postoperatively. Implantation of a novel annular repair device was associated with greater maintenance of disk height and improved 1-year leg pain, back pain, and low-back disability. Recurrent disk herniation did not occur in any patient after annular repair. Closure of annular defect after lumbar discectomy may help preserve the physiological disk function and prevent long-term disk height loss and associated back and leg pain.",

However, the performance of the Barricaid device in a United States (US) population has not been previously reported. This is a historically controlled post-market multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of the Barricaid device when used in addition to primary lumbar discectomy in a US population. A total of 75 patients with large annular defects will receive the Barricaid device following lumbar discectomy at up to 25 sites in the US and will return for clinical and imaging follow-up at 4 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year. Trial oversight will be provided by a data safety monitoring board and imaging studies will be read by an independent imaging core laboratory. Patients treated with the Barricaid device in a previous European randomized trial with comparable eligibility criteria, surgical procedures, and outcome measures will serve as historical controls. Main outcomes will include back pain severity, leg pain severity, Oswestry Disability Index, health utility on the EuroQol-5 Dimension questionnaire, complications, symptomatic reherniation, and reoperation. Propensity score adjustment using inverse probability of treatment weighting will be used to adjust for differences in baseline patient characteristics between the US trial participants and European historical controls.

To establish a reliable in vitro herniation model with human cadaver spines that enables evaluation of anular closure devices. Biomechanically, it is desirable to close anulus defects after disc herniation to preserve as much nucleus as possible. Multiple anular closure options exist to prevent reherniation. A reliable test procedure is needed to evaluate the efficacy and reliability of these implants. Two groups of human lumbar segments (n = 6 per group) were tested under cyclic loading until herniation occurred or 100,000 load cycles were applied. One group contained moderate/severe degenerated discs. A second group had mild degenerated discs. Intradiscal pressure was measured in the intact state to confirm disc quality.If herniation occurred, the extruded material was reinserted into the disc and the anulus defect was treated with the Barricaid anular closure device (Intrinsic Therapeutics, Inc., Woburn, MA). Disc height and 3-dimensional flexibility of the specimens in the intact, defect, and implanted states were measured under pure moments in each principal motion plane. Afterwards, provocation of reherniation was attempted with additional 100,000 load cycles. Likelihood of herniation was strongly linked to disc degeneration and supported by the magnitude of intradiscal pressure. In moderate/severe degenerated discs, only 1 herniation was created. In mild degenerated discs, herniations were reliably created in all specimens. Using this worst-case model, herniation caused a significant reduction of disc height, which was nearly restored with the implant. In no case was reherniation or implant migration visible after 100,000 load cycles after Barricaid implantation. We established a human herniation model that reliably produced nucleus extrusion during cyclic loading by selecting specimens with low disc degeneration. The Barricaid seems to prevent nucleus from reherniating. The reliability of this method suggests the opportunity to investigate other anulus closure devices and nucleus replacement techniques critically.",

The most frequent Rett missense mutations are located in either the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) or transcription repression domain (TRD). Clinical roles for mutations in other domains such as the intervening domain (ID) or AT-Hook domains have yet to be determined. Here, we report functional analysis of MECP2 missense mutations, located in AT-Hook1 within the ID, in a large Pakistani family with childhood onset cognitive decline and schizophrenia (SCZ), de novo in a girl with atypical Rett syndrome, and de novo in a woman with SCZ. We show that both p.Arg190His and p.Arg190Cys affect the ability of MeCP2 to bind to AT-rich DNA, also the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoter, with the more drastic effects seen for p.Arg190Cys. Both mutations also affect nuclear chromatin clustering in vitro. These data support a possible molecular link between MECP2 AT-Hook1 mutations and psychosis. Given the ongoing large-scale whole exome and whole genome sequencing projects for psychiatric disorders, our findings suggest that rare missense variants in MECP2 be carefully evaluated for molecular consequences.",

Because restoration of MeCP2 expression in a mouse model reverses neurologic deficits in adult animals, reactivation of the wild-type copy of MeCP2 on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) presents a therapeutic opportunity in RS. To identify genes involved in MeCP2 silencing, we screened a library of 60,000 shRNAs using a cell line with a MeCP2 reporter on the Xi and found 30 genes clustered in seven functional groups. More than half encoded proteins with known enzymatic activity, and six were members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/TGF-\u03b2 pathway. shRNAs directed against each of these six genes down-regulated X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a key player in X-chromosome inactivation that encodes an RNA that coats the silent X chromosome, and modulation of regulators of this pathway both in cell culture and in mice demonstrated robust regulation of XIST. Moreover, we show that Rnf12, an X-encoded ubiquitin ligase important for initiation of X-chromosome inactivation and XIST transcription in ES cells, also plays a role in maintenance of the inactive state through regulation of BMP/TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Our results identify pharmacologically suitable targets for reactivation of MeCP2 on the Xi and a genetic circuitry that maintains XIST expression and X-chromosome inactivation in differentiated cells.",

Here, we describe a key role for a constitutive BDNF feed forward signaling pathway in regulating synaptic response, general growth and differentiation of glutamatergic neurons. Chronic block of TrkB receptors mimics the MeCP2 deficiency in wildtype glutamatergic neurons, while re-expression of BDNF quantitatively rescues MeCP2 deficiency. We show that BDNF acts cell autonomous and autocrine, as wildtype neurons are not capable of rescuing growth deficits in neighboring MeCP2 deficient neurons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.

Although there is no effective therapy for Rett syndrome, the recently discovered disease reversibility in mice suggests that there are therapeutic possibilities. Identification of MeCP2 targets or modifiers of the phenotype can facilitate the design of curative strategies. To identify possible novel MeCP2 interactors, we exploited a bioinformatic approach and selected Ying Yang 1 (YY1) as an interesting candidate. We demonstrate that MeCP2 interacts in vitro and in vivo with YY1, a ubiquitous zinc-finger epigenetic factor regulating the expression of several genes. We show that MeCP2 cooperates with YY1 in repressing the ANT1 gene encoding a mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase. Importantly, ANT1 mRNA levels are increased in human and mouse cell lines devoid of MeCP2, in Rett patient fibroblasts and in the brain of Mecp2-null mice. We further demonstrate that ANT1 protein levels are upregulated in Mecp2-null mice. Finally, the identified MeCP2-YY1 interaction, together with the well-known involvement of YY1 in the regulation of D4Z4-associated genes at 4q35, led us to discover the anomalous depression of FRG2, a subtelomeric gene of unknown function, in Rett fibroblasts. Collectively, our data indicate that mutations in MeCP2 might cause the aberrant overexpression of genes located at a specific locus, thus providing new candidates for the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. As both ANT1 mutations and overexpression have been associated with human diseases, we consider it highly relevant to address the consequences of ANT1 deregulation in Rett syndrome.",

Mutations in the MeCP2 gene cause Rett syndrome, a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. Recent studies also have shown that MeCP2 plays a role in carcinogenesis. Specifically, functional ablation of MeCP2 suppresses cell growth and leads to the proliferation of cancer cells. However, MeCP2's function in adult tissues remains poorly understood. We utilized a weight matrix-based comparison software to identify transcription factor binding site (TFBS) of MeCP2-regulated genes, which were recognized by cDNA microarray analysis. MeCP2 expression was silenced using annealed siRNA in HEK293 cells, and then a cDNA microarray analysis was performed. Functional analysis was carried out, and transcriptional levels in target genes regulated by MeCP2 were investigated. TFBS analysis was done within genes selected by the cDNA microarray analysis, using a weight matrix-based program and the TRANSFAC 6.0 database. Among the differentially expressed genes with a change in expression greater than two-fold, 189 genes were up-regulated and 91 genes were down-regulated. Genes related to apoptosis and cell proliferation (JUN, FOSL2, CYR61, SKIL, ATF3, BMABI, BMPR2, RERE, and FALZ) were highly up-regulated. Genes with anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative functions (HNRPA0, HIS1, and FOXC1) were down-regulated. Using TFBS analysis within putative promoters of novel candidate target genes of MeCP2, disease-related transcription factors were identified. The present results provide insights into the new target genes regulated by MeCP2 under epigenetic control.

Here, we apply the approach of site-directed RNA editing to repair, at the mRNA level, a disease-causing guanosine to adenosine (G &gt; A) mutation in the mouse MeCP2 DNA binding domain. To mediate repair, we exploit the catalytic domain of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR2) that deaminates A to inosine (I) residues that are subsequently translated as G. We fuse the ADAR2 domain, tagged with a nuclear localization signal, to an RNA binding peptide from bacteriophage lambda. In cultured neurons from mice that harbor an RTT patient G &gt; A mutation and express engineered ADAR2, along with an appropriate RNA guide to target the enzyme, 72% of <i>Mecp2</i> mRNA is repaired. Levels of MeCP2 protein are also increased significantly. Importantly, as in wild-type neurons, the repaired MeCP2 protein is enriched in heterochromatic foci, reflecting restoration of normal MeCP2 binding to methylated DNA.

Although the clinical and neuropathological signs of RTT suggest disrupted synaptic function, the specific role of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in postmitotic neurons remains relatively unknown. We examined whether MeCP2 deficiency in central neurons contributes to the neuropathogenesis in RTT. Primary cerebellar granule neuronal cultures from wild-type (WT) and MeCP2-/- mice were exposed to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA-induced excitotoxicity and hypoxic-ischemic insult. The magnitude of cell death in MeCP2-/- cells after excitotoxicity and hypoxia was greater than in the WT littermate control cultures and occurred after shorter exposures that usually, in the WT, would not cause cell death. Pretreatment with the growth factor fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) under conditions at which WT cells showed complete neuroprotection, only partially protected MeCP2-/- cells. To elucidate specifically the effects of MeCP2 knockout (KO) on cell death, we examined two death cascade pathways. MeCP2-/- neurons exposed to 6 h of hypoxia exhibited enhanced activation of the proapoptotic caspase-3 and increased mitochondrial release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) compared with WT neurons, which did not show significant changes. However, pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK had little or no effect on AIF release and its subcellular translocation to the nucleus, suggesting caspase-independent AIF release and their independent contribution to hypoxia-induced cell death. Reintroduction of intact MeCP2 gene in MeCP2-/- cells or MeCP2 gene silencing by MeCP2siRNA in WT cells further confirmed the differential sensitivity of the WT and MeCP2-/- cells and suggest a direct role of MeCP2 in cell death. These results clearly demonstrate increased cell death occurred in neurons lacking MeCP2 expression via both caspase- and AIF-dependent apoptotic mechanisms.

More than 95% of individuals with RTT have mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), whose protein product modulates gene transcription. Surprisingly, although the disorder is caused by mutations in a single gene, disease severity in affected individuals can be quite variable. To explore the source of this phenotypic variability, we propose that specific MECP2 mutations lead to different degrees of disease severity. Using a database of 1052 participants assessed over 4940 unique visits, the largest cohort of both typical and atypical RTT patients studied to date, we examined the relationship between MECP2 mutation status and various phenotypic measures over time. In general agreement with previous studies, we found that particular mutations, such as p.Arg133Cys, p.Arg294X, p.Arg306Cys, 3\u00b0 truncations and other point mutations, were relatively less severe in both typical and atypical RTT. In contrast, p.Arg106Trp, p.Arg168X, p.Arg255X, p.Arg270X, splice sites, deletions, insertions and deletions were significantly more severe. We also demonstrated that, for most mutation types, clinical severity increases with age. Furthermore, of the clinical features of RTT, ambulation, hand use and age at onset of stereotypies are strongly linked to overall disease severity. We have confirmed that MECP2 mutation type is a strong predictor of disease severity. These data also indicate that clinical severity continues to become progressively worse regardless of initial severity.

Numerous genes were observed to be overexpressed in RTT patients compared with control samples, including excellent candidate genes for neurodevelopmental disease. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that binding of MeCP2 to corresponding promoter CpG islands was lost in RTT-derived cells harboring a mutation in the region of the MECP2 gene encoding the MBD. Bisulfite genomic sequencing demonstrated that the majority of MeCP2 binding occurred in DNA sequences with methylation-associated silencing.

By using TaqMan technology and a mouse model expressing a truncated Mecp2 (Mecp2(308/y)), we firstly showed in neurons that Bdnf transcripts containing exon I, IIb, IIc, IV, and VI are prominently expressed, whereas in astrocytes, Bdnf transcript containing exon VI is preferentially expressed, suggesting a specific regulation of Bdnf expression at the cellular level. Secondly, we confirmed the repressive role of Mecp2 only on the expression of Bdnf VI in neurons. Our data suggested that the truncated Mecp2 protein maintains its function on Bdnf expression regulation in neurons and in astrocytes. Interestingly, we observed that Bdnf transcripts (I and IXA), regulated by neural activity induced by bicuculline in Mecp2(308/y) neurons, were not affected by histone deacetylase inhibition. In contrast, Bdnf transcripts (IIb, IIc, and VI), regulated by histone deacetylation, were not affected by bicuculline treatment in wild-type and Mecp2(308/y) neurons.

We examined the association between disease severity score, assessed by the modified Percy score, and BDNF polymorphism, using regression methods, in 125 mutation-positive patients with RTT from the Australian Rett Syndrome Database and an Israeli cohort. Those who were heterozygous (Val/Met) had slightly more severe disease than those who were homozygous for the wild-type (Val/Val) BDNF polymorphism (increased severity score 2.1, p = 0.09). In those with p.R168X, a commonly occurring MECP2 mutation in RTT, there was a 6-point increase in severity score for those who were heterozygous for the BDNF polymorphism, both unadjusted (p = 0.02) and adjusted for age (p = 0.03). Individuals with the p.R168X mutation and heterozygous for the BDNF polymorphism were also at an increased risk of seizure onset (hazard ratio 5.3, 95% confidence interval 1.6-17.7) compared with those homozygous for the wild-type BDNF allele.

Using a stem cell-based system allowing the synchronous differentiation of neuronal progenitors, we found that in the absence of MeCP2, the size of neuronal nuclei fails to increase at normal rates during differentiation. This is accompanied by a marked decrease in the rate of ribonucleotide incorporation, indicating an early role of MeCP2 in regulating total gene transcription, not restricted to selected mRNAs. We also found that the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were decreased in mutant neurons, while those of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin increased at similar rates in wild-type and mutant neurons. By contrast, nuclear size, transcription rates, and BDNF levels remained unchanged in astrocytes lacking MeCP2. Re-expressing MeCP2 in mutant neurons rescued the nuclear size phenotype as well as BDNF levels.

Micro-CT of tibia from 5 week-old Mecp2-null mice showed significant alterations in trabecular bone including reductions in bone volume fraction (-29%), number (-19%), thickness (-9%) and connectivity density (-32%), and increases in trabecular separation (+28%) compared to WT. We also found significant reductions in cortical bone thickness (-18%) and in polar moment of inertia (-45%). In contrast, cortical and trabecular bone from 8 week-old WT and HET female mice were not significantly different. However, mineral apposition rate, mineralizing surface and bone formation rate/bone surface were each decreased in HET and Mecp2-null mice compared to WT mice. Histomorphometric analysis of femurs showed decreased numbers of osteoblasts but similar numbers of osteoclasts compared to WT, altered osteoblast morphology and decreased tissue synthesis of alkaline phosphatase in Mecp2-null and HET mice. Osteoblasts cultured from Mecp2-null mice, which unlike WT osteoblasts did not express MeCP2, had increased growth rates, but reductions in mRNA expression of type I collagen, Runx2 and Osterix compared to WT osteoblasts. These results indicate that MeCP2 deficiency leads to altered bone growth. Osteoblast dysfunction was more marked in Mecp2-null male than in HET female mice, suggesting that expression of MeCP2 plays a critical role in bone development.",

Therefore, we chose to investigate the serotonergic system in hippocampus and brainstem of male <i>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></i> knock-out mice in the B6.129P2(C)-Mecp2(tm1.1Bird) mouse model of RTT. The serotonergic system in mouse is comprised of 16 genes, whose mRNA expression profile was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. <i>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></i> mice are an established animal model for RTT displaying most of the cognitive and physical impairments of human patients and the selected areas receive significant modulation through serotonin. Using anatomically and functional characterized areas, we found region-specific differential expression between wild type and <i>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></i> mice at post-natal day 40. In brainstem, we found five genes to be dysregulated, while in hippocampus, two genes were dysregulated. The one gene dysregulated in both brain regions was dopamine decarboxylase, but of special interest is the serotonin receptor 5b (5-ht<sub>5b</sub>), which showed 75-fold dysregulation in brainstem of <i>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></i> mice. This dysregulation was not due to upregulation, but due to failure of down-regulation in <i>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></i> mice during development.

One of its targets is the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf). In vitro studies using cultured neurons have produced conflicting results with respect to the role of MeCP2 in BDNF expression. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) induces plasticity in the respiratory system characterized by long-term facilitation of phrenic nerve amplitude. This paradigm induces an increase in BDNF protein. We hypothesized that AIH leads to augmentation of BDNF transcription in respiratory-related areas of the brainstem and that MeCP2 is necessary for this process. Wild-type and mecp2 null (mecp2(-/y)) mice were subjected to three 5-min episodes of exposure to 8% O(2)/4% CO(2)/88% N(2), delivered at 5-min intervals. Normoxia control wild-type and mecp2 null mice were exposed to room air for the total length of time, that is, 30 min. Following a recovery in room air, the pons and medulla were rapidly removed. Expression of BDNF protein and transcripts were determined by ELISA and quantitative PCR, respectively. AIH induced a significant increase in BDNF protein in the pons and medulla, and in mRNA transcript levels in the pons of wild-type animals. In contrast, there were no significant changes in either BDNF protein or transcripts in the pons or medulla of mice lacking MeCP2. The results indicate that MeCP2 is required for regulation of BDNF expression by acute intermittent hypoxia in vivo.",

In spite of their involvement in the same disease, a functional interaction between the two genes has not been proven. MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator; CDKL5 encodes for a kinase protein that might be involved in the regulation of gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that mutations affecting the two genes may lead to similar phenotypes by dysregulating the expression of common genes. To test this hypothesis we used induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from fibroblasts of one Rett patient with a MECP2 mutation (p.Arg306Cys) and two patients with mutations in CDKL5 (p.Gln347Ter and p.Thr288Ile). Expression profiling was performed in CDKL5-mutated cells and genes of interest were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in both CDKL5- and MECP2-mutated cells. The only major change in gene expression common to MECP2- and CDKL5-mutated cells was for GRID1, encoding for glutamate D1 receptor (GluD1), a member of the \u03b4-family of ionotropic glutamate receptors. GluD1 does not form AMPA or NMDA glutamate receptors. It acts like an adhesion molecule by linking the postsynaptic and presynaptic compartments, preferentially inducing the inhibitory presynaptic differentiation of cortical neurons. Our results demonstrate that GRID1 expression is downregulated in both MECP2- and CDKL5-mutated iPS cells and upregulated in neuronal precursors and mature neurons. These data provide novel insights into disease pathophysiology and identify possible new targets for therapeutic treatment of Rett syndrome.",

High levels of COL6A3 and its cleaved product, endotrophin (ETP) in tumor-neighboring regions are strongly associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Here, we report that the high levels of ETP in injured hepatocytes induce JNK-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis and activate nonparenchymal cells to lead further activation of hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. Nevertheless ETP per se showed limited phenotypic changes in normal liver tissues. Furthermore, inhibition of ETP activity by utilizing neutralizing antibodies efficiently suppressed the pathological consequences in chronic liver diseases. Our results implicate ETP mechanistically as a crucial mediator in reciprocal interactions among various hepatic cell populations in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease, and it could be a promising therapeutic target particularly in individuals with high local levels of COL6A3.

We tested the hypothesis that urinary endotrophin derived during COL VI deposition in fibrotic human kidneys is a marker for progression of CKD in the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) cohort, a prospective observational study of 499 CKD patients. Endotrophin localised to areas of increased COL VI deposition in fibrotic kidneys but was not present in histologically normal kidneys.

This study aimed to explore the clinical potential of bimagrumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the activin type II receptor, for the recovery of skeletal muscle volume from disuse atrophy using an experimental model of lower extremity immobilization. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy young men (n = 24; mean age, 24.1 years) were placed in a full-length cast of one of the lower extremities for 2 weeks to induce disuse atrophy. After cast removal, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of either bimagrumab 30 mg/kg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 9) and were followed for 12 weeks. Changes in thigh muscle volume (TMV) and inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) of the thigh, maximum voluntary knee extension strength, and safety were assessed throughout the 12 week study. Casting resulted in an average TMV loss of -4.8% and comparable increases in IMAT and SCAT volumes. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. resulted in a rapid increase in TMV at 2 weeks following cast removal and a +5.1% increase above pre-cast levels at 12 weeks. In comparison, TMV returned to pre-cast level at 12 weeks (-0.1%) in the placebo group. The increased adiposity of the casted leg was sustained in the placebo group and decreased substantially in the bimagrumab group at Week 12 (IMAT: -6.6%, SCAT: -3.5%). Knee extension strength decreased by ~25% in the casted leg for all subjects and returned to pre-cast levels within 6 weeks after cast removal in both treatment arms.

Animals (n = 150) were divided into 11 groups and received weekly treatment with either bimagrumab (10 or 100 mg/kg) or vehicle. Progression and outcomes of bone healing were assessed by lateral radiographs in vivo as well as by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), 4-point bending test, and microscopic examination of the excised fibula at Day 29 or later. The radiographic progression of bone healing showed no significant differences between treatment groups in any comparative setting. In 3-month-old animals, pQCT revealed slightly reduced immature callus size and bone mineral content in bimagrumab-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals at Day 29 (p &lt; 0.05). There were, however, no differences in mature callus size, bone mineral density, or biomechanical competency. The aforementioned effects on immature callus size were not present when the treatment was initiated 4 weeks post osteotomy or when treating 6-month-old animals. In summary, these findings suggest that there is no major impact of ActRII blockade on overall fracture healing, and delayed treatment initiation can bypass the small and transient effect of the therapy on immature callus formation observed in younger animals. Verification of these findings in humans is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial on elderly hip fracture patients.",

Cachectic patients with advanced cancer often receive anti-cancer therapies against their specific cancer type as a standard of care, and whether specific ActRII inhibition is efficacious when combined with anti-cancer agents has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we evaluated interactions between ActRII blockade and anti-cancer agents in CT-26 mouse colon cancer-induced cachexia model. CDD866 (murinized version of bimagrumab) is a neutralizing antibody against the activin receptor type II (ActRII) preventing binding of ligands such as myostatin and activin A, which are involved in cancer cachexia. CDD866 was evaluated in association with cisplatin as a standard cytotoxic agent or with everolimus, a molecular-targeted agent against mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In the early studies, the treatment effect on cachexia was investigated, and in the additional studies, the treatment effect on progression of cancer and the associated cachexia was evaluated using body weight loss or tumor volume as interruption criteria. Cisplatin accelerated body weight loss and tended to exacerbate skeletal muscle loss in cachectic animals, likely due to some toxicity of this anti-cancer agent. Administration of CDD866 alone or in combination with cisplatin protected from skeletal muscle weight loss compared to animals receiving only cisplatin, corroborating that ActRII inhibition remains fully efficacious under cisplatin treatment. In contrast, everolimus treatment alone significantly protected the tumor-bearing mice against skeletal muscle weight loss caused by CT-26 tumor. CDD866 not only remains efficacious in the presence of everolimus but also showed a non-significant trend for an additive effect on reversing skeletal muscle weight loss. Importantly, both combination therapies slowed down time-to-progression. Anti-ActRII blockade is an effective intervention against cancer cachexia providing benefit even in the presence of anti-cancer therapies. Co-treatment comprising chemotherapies and ActRII inhibitors might constitute a promising new approach to alleviate chemotherapy- and cancer-related wasting conditions and extend survival rates in cachectic cancer patients.",

Several other ligands, including GDF11 and the activins, signal through this pathway, suggesting that the ActRII receptors are major regulatory nodes in the regulation of muscle mass. We have developed a novel, human anti-ActRII antibody (bimagrumab, or BYM338) to prevent binding of ligands to the receptors and thus inhibit downstream signaling. BYM338 enhances differentiation of primary human skeletal myoblasts and counteracts the inhibition of differentiation induced by myostatin or activin A. BYM338 prevents myostatin- or activin A-induced atrophy through inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, thus sparing the myosin heavy chain from degradation. BYM338 dramatically increases skeletal muscle mass in mice, beyond sole inhibition of myostatin, detected by comparing the antibody with a myostatin inhibitor. A mouse version of the antibody induces enhanced muscle hypertrophy in myostatin mutant mice, further confirming a beneficial effect on muscle growth beyond myostatin inhibition alone through blockade of ActRII ligands. BYM338 protects muscles from glucocorticoid-induced atrophy and weakness via prevention of muscle and tetanic force losses.

Physical exercise may be beneficial in these situations, but further work is still needed to translate acceptable and effective biomechanical interventions like vibration therapy from animal models to humans. Novel antiresorptive and anabolic therapies are emerging for osteoporosis as well as drugs for sarcopenia, cancer cachexia or muscle wasting disorders, including antibodies against myostatin or activin receptor type IIA and IIB (e.g. bimagrumab). Ideally, increasing muscle mass would increase muscle strength and restore bone loss from disuse. However, the classical view that muscle is unidirectionally dominant over bone via mechanical loading is overly simplistic. Indeed, recent studies indicate a role for neuronal regulation of not only muscle but also bone metabolism, bone signaling pathways like receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) implicated in muscle biology, myokines affecting bone and possible bone-to-muscle communication. Moreover, pharmacological strategies inducing isolated myocyte hypertrophy may not translate into increased muscle power because tendons, connective tissue, neurons and energy metabolism need to adapt as well. We aim here to critically review key musculoskeletal molecular pathways involved in mechanoregulation and their effect on the bone-muscle unit as a whole, as well as preclinical and emerging clinical evidence regarding the effects of sarcopenia therapies on osteoporosis and vice versa.",

Although the transposition is facilitated by proteins encoded within the gag-pol region which is common to all autonomous elements, some LTR retrotransposons were found to potentially carry an additional protein coding capacity represented by extra open reading frames located upstream or downstream of gag-pol. In this study, we performed a comprehensive in silico survey and comparative analysis of these extra open reading frames (ORFs) in the group of Ty3/gypsy LTR retrotransposons as the first step towards our understanding of their origin and function. We found that extra ORFs occur in all three major lineages of plant Ty3/gypsy elements, being the most frequent in the Tat lineage where most (77 %) of identified elements contained extra ORFs. This lineage was also characterized by the highest diversity of extra ORF arrangement (position and orientation) within the elements. On the other hand, all of these ORFs could be classified into only two broad groups based on their mutual similarities or the presence of short conserved motifs in their inferred protein sequences. In the Athila lineage, the extra ORFs were confined to the element 3' regions but they displayed much higher sequence diversity compared to those found in Tat. In the lineage of Chromoviruses the extra ORFs were relatively rare, occurring only in 5' regions of a group of elements present in a single plant family (Poaceae). In all three lineages, most extra ORFs lacked sequence similarities to characterized gene sequences or functional protein domains, except for two Athila-like elements with similarities to LOGL4 gene and part of the Chromoviruses extra ORFs that displayed partial similarity to histone H3 gene. Thus, in these cases the extra ORFs most likely originated by transduction or recombination of cellular gene sequences. In addition, the protein domain which is otherwise associated with DNA transposons have been detected in part of the Tat-like extra ORFs, pointing to their origin from an insertion event of a mobile element.",

Insertions of the TATA box upstream of a SUP2 box A mutant affected the level of transcription and restricted the use of upstream start sites, but they neither enhanced the use of TATA-dependent initiation sites nor restored expression to the level of the wild-type gene. We conclude that (i) the U6 TATA box is essential in vivo for correct initiation but not for transcription, (ii) a TATA box does not compensate for a weak box A sequence and so cannot perform equivalently, and (iii) the TATA-binding protein, and probably components of transcription factor IIIB, are present on the target at the time of Ty3 integration.",

Ty3 was shown to insert upstream of tRNA, 5S, and U6 genes, all of which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Integration sites were within 1-4 nucleotides of the position of transcription initiation, even for one mutant gene where the polymerase III initiation site was shifted to a completely new context. Mutagenesis of a SUP2 tRNA gene target showed that integration required functional promoter elements but that it did not correlate in a simple way with target transcription. This is the first report directly linking a discrete genomic function with preferential insertion of a retrotransposon.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1963869": "Insertions of the yeast element Ty3 resulting from induced retrotransposition were characterized in order to identify the genomic targets of transposition. The DNA sequences of the junctions between Ty3 and flanking DNA were determined for two insertions of an unmarked element. Each insertion was at position -17 from the 5' end of a tRNA-coding sequence. Ninety-one independent insertions of a marked Ty3 element were studied by Southern blot analysis. Pairs of independent insertions into seven genomic loci accounted for 14 of these insertions. The DNA sequence flanking the insertion site was determined for at least one member of each pair of integrated elements. In each case, insertion was at position -16 or -17 relative to the 5' end of one of seven different tRNA genes. This proportion of genomic loci used twice for Ty3 integration is consistent with that predicted by a Poisson distribution for a number of genomic targets roughly equivalent to the estimated number of yeast tRNA genes. In addition, insertions upstream of the same tRNA gene in one case were at different positions, but in all cases were in the same orientation. Thus, genomic insertions of Ty3 in a particular orientation are apparently specified by the target, while the actual position of the insertion relative to the tRNA-coding sequence can vary slightly.",

Less commonly, a large deletion or a complex rearrangement involving the 7q36 region is associated with CS. We investigated the spectrum of MNX1 pathogenic variants and associated clinical features in the Korean patients with CS. We enrolled 25 patients with CS, including 24 sporadic cases and one familial case. Direct sequencing of MNX1 and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were performed. We also analyzed clinical phenotypes and evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations. We identified six novel variants amongst a total of six null variants, one missense variant, and one large deletion. The null variants included four frameshift variants (p.Gly98Alafs* 124, p.Gly145Alafs*77, p.Gly151Leufs*67, and p.Ala216Profs*5) and two nonsense variants (p.Tyr186* and p.Gln212*). The missense variant, p.Lys295Gln, was located in the highly-conserved homeobox domain and was predicted to be deleterious. A large deletion involving the 7q36 region was detected in one patient. Pathogenic variants in MNX1 were detected in 28% of all CS cases and 25% of sporadic cases. The clinical phenotype was variable in patients with and without pathogenic variants; no significant genotype-phenotype correlation was observed. This study revealed the spectrum and phenotypic variability of MNX1 pathogenic variants in the Korean population.",

The diagnosis is usually made during childhood and rarely in adulthood. In this context, imaging, and especially MRI plays a major role in the diagnosis of this syndrome. Surgical management is provided by pediatric surgeons or neurosurgeons. Here, we present a family case report with CS requiring different neurosurgical management. The son, a 3-year-old boy, developed a tethered spinal cord syndrome associated to a lipoma of the filum terminale, a sacro-coccygeal teratoma and an anal adhesion. A combined surgical approach permitted a good evolution on the urinary and digestive functions despite a persistent fecal incontinence. The 2-year-old daughter presented with a cyst of the thyreoglossal tract infected and fistulized to the skin. She was also followed for a very small lipoma of the filum terminale that required a neurosurgical approach. The father, 44-year-old, manifested functional digestive and urinary disorders caused by a giant anterior sacral meningocele. The ligation of the neck of the cyst and aspiration of the liquid inside in full through a posterior partial approach permit a complete collapse of the cyst with an instantly satisfactory clinical outcome. In these cases, cooperation between pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons was crucial. The follow-up of these patients should be done in a spina bifida clinic. A geneticist evaluation must be offered to the patient in the case of a CS as well as a clinical evaluation of the relatives (parents, siblings).",

A neonate with Currarino triad and dual pathology in the presacral mass is described in this report. A male Chinese neonate, who presented with abdominal distention and constipation on the second day of life, was found to have features of Currarino triad.

The syndrome occurs in the majority of patients as an autosomal dominant trait associated with mutations in the homeobox gene HLXB9 which encodes the nuclear protein HB9. However, genotype-phenotype analyses have been performed only in a few families and there are no reports about the specific impact of HLXB9 mutations on HB9 function. We performed a mutational analysis in 72 individuals from nine families with Currarino syndrome. We identified a total of five HLXB9 mutations, four novel and one known mutation, in four out of four families and one out of five sporadic cases. Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein.",

In most cases autosomal dominant transmission is suggested. In family members one or two features of the syndrome may be missing, indicating an incomplete form of this complex. We describe two unrelated girls at the age of 8 and 9 months respectively with ASP-association. Family screening in both patients showed 8 additional cases with a complete or incomplete Currarino triad, four of them being asymptomatic. A review of the literature up to 1991 revealed 48 patients with ASP-association. In more than 80% of cases, this complex is diagnosed in the first decade, whereas incomplete Currarino syndrome is diagnosed predominantly in adults. Most frequently the presacral mass in ASP-association was reported to be an anterior meningocele (47%) and a benign teratoma (40%). The number of patients with Currarino syndrome has been underestimated so far. We recommend anorectal examination, pelvic ultrasound and pelvic x-rays in all patients with a history of chronic constipation since early childhood. Positive findings should lead to further investigations such as barium enema, MRI, myelography and family screening. Close cooperation between pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons is required to ensure adequate surgical treatment, considering both the risk of malignant degeneration as well as the risk of intraoperative nerve damage.

Ultra-flexible vesicles, e.g. invasomes and core-multishell (CMS) nanotransporters are efficient drug delivery systems for dermatological applications. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques were used for the determination of localization and distribution of the spin label 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (PCA; logP=-1.7) within the carrier systems and the ability of the carriers to promote penetration of PCA into the skin. The results show an exclusive localization of PCA in the hydrophilic compartments of the invasome dispersion and the CMS nanotransporter solution. PCA penetration was enhanced 2.5 fold for CMS and 1.9 fold for invasomes compared to PCA solution. Investigation of penetration depth by step-wise removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripping revealed deepest PCA penetration for invasomes.

In this randomized, multicenter study, 1939 healthy infants were immunized at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with 1 of 3 lots of DTaP(5) coadministered with IPV and Hib vaccines or 1 lot of DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib combination vaccine. Subsequently, 849 of these study participants were given a fourth dose of DTaP(5) and Hib vaccines or a fourth dose of DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib at 1 to 16 months of age. Safety was monitored throughout the study, and blood specimens were obtained to assess antibody responses. DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib elicited similar or fewer solicited injection-site and systemic reactions as compared with the separate administration of US-licensed DTaP(5), IPV, and Hib vaccines. Seroresponse and seroprotection rates elicited by DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib were noninferior to US-licensed equivalent vaccines after the infant series and after the fourth dose. Children immunized with DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib had higher antibody geometric mean concentrations to pertussis toxoid and filamentous hemagglutinin; children immunized with the separate vaccines had higher responses to pertactin. Hib antibody responses to Hib polysaccharide were nearly identical in the DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib and separate-vaccine groups.

Angiotensin (Ang) II, the most active metabolite of the renin-angiotensin system, plays an outstanding role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular injury. Activation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has shown to attenuate devastating effects of Ang II in the cardiovascular system by reducing Ang II degradation and increasing Ang-(1-7) generation leading to Mas receptor activation. Recent Advances: Activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis reduces hypertension and improves vascular injury mainly through an increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreased reactive oxygen species production. Recent studies reported that shedding of the enzymatically active ectodomain of ACE2 from the cell surface seems to regulate its activity and serves as an interorgan communicator in cardiovascular disease. In addition, collectrin, an ACE2 homolog with no catalytic activity, regulates blood pressure through an NO-dependent mechanism. Large body of experimental data confirmed sustained beneficial effects of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis activation on hypertension and vascular injury. Experimental studies also suggest that activation of collectrin might be beneficial in hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. Their role in clinical hypertension is unclear as selective and reliable activators of both axes are not yet available. This review will highlight the results of recent research progress that illustrate the role of both ACE and collectrin in the modulation of NO and oxidative stress in blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury, providing evidence for the potential therapeutic application of ACE2 and collectrin in hypertension and vascular disease.

ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein and contains a catalytically active ectodomain that can be shed from the cell surface into the extracellular space, via cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM-17). ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml. While MLN-4760 potently inhibits the activity of both human and mouse ACE2, DX600 (linear form) only effectively blocks human ACE2 activity in this assay. In biological samples of human and mouse urine, cell culture medium from mouse proximal tubular cells, and mouse plasma, the mean intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of the assay range from 1.43 to 4.39 %, and from 7.01 to 13.17 %, respectively. We present data on the time and substrate concentration dependence of the assay, and show that exogenous D -glucose, creatinine, urea, and albumin do not interfere with its performance. In biological fluids, this assay is a simple and reliable method to study the role of ACE2 and its shed fragments in cardiovascular and renal diseases.",

Examination revealed an isolated 1cm laceration on the right upper eyelid, superior to her medial canthus. She experienced diplopia on right horizontal gaze due to a left internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) with an associated left conjugate horizontal gaze palsy, collectively described as a left one-and-a-half syndrome. CT and MRI demonstrated evidence of a deep penetrating injury above the right medial canthus, traversing the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, the dorsum sella, narrowly missing the basilar artery, penetrating the pons, and extending to the floor of the contralateral fourth ventricle. The patient was diagnosed with multiple sinus fractures, lesions in her left paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) and medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and progressive pneumocephalus. She underwent a transsphenoidal endoscopic repair via a vascularized mucosal flap without complication.

The SYT protein appears to act as a transcriptional co-activator and the SSX proteins as co-repressors. Here we have investigated the functional domains of the proteins. The SYT protein has a novel conserved 54 amino acid domain at the N-terminus of the protein (the SNH domain) which is found in proteins from a wide variety of species, and a C-terminal domain, rich in glutamine, proline, glycine and tyrosine (the QPGY domain), which contains the transcriptional activator sequences. Deletion of the SNH domain results in a more active transcriptional activator, suggesting that this domain acts as an inhibitor of the activation domain. The C-terminal SSX domain present in SYT-SSX translocation protein contributes a transcriptional repressor domain to the protein. Thus, the fusion protein has transcriptional activating and repressing domains. We demonstrate that the human homologue of the SNF2/Brahama protein BRM co-localizes with SYT and SYT-SSX in nuclear speckles, and also interacts with SYT and SYT-SSX proteins in vitro. This interaction may provide an explanation of how the SYT protein activates gene transcription.",

The wild-type proteins, as well as the resultant SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 fusion proteins, are localized in the nucleus. Recent studies in experimental systems indicated that the SYT protein may function as a transcriptional activator whereas the SSX proteins may act as transcriptional repressors. In the present work we created a series of deletion mutants and found that SYT and SSX depend on N-terminal and highly conserved C-terminal domains for nuclear localization, respectively. Our results also show that the SYT-SSX proteins colocalize with SSX2, a feature that depends on the presence of the C-terminal SSX sequences in the chimeric proteins. Absence of these sequences led to an altered subcellular localization, coinciding with that of SYT. Besides, we found that endogenously expressed SSX proteins colocalize with polycomb-group proteins and condensed chromosomes during mitosis, features that are also conferred by the C-terminus of SSX. Taken together, these results led us to conclude that the SSX moiety, especially the most C-terminal 34 amino acids, of the SYT-SSX fusion proteins is crucial for aberrant spatial targeting and transcriptional control within the nucleus.",

The SS18 and SSX genes encode nuclear proteins that exhibit opposite transcriptional activities. The SS18 protein functions as a transcriptional coactivator and is associated with the SWI/SNF complex, whereas the SSX proteins function as transcriptional corepressors and are associated with the polycomb complex. The domains involved in these opposite transcriptional activities are retained in the SS18-SSX fusion proteins. Here, we set out to determine the direct transcriptional consequences of conditional SS18-SSX2 fusion protein expression using complementary DNA microarray-based profiling. By doing so, we identified several clusters of SS18-SSX2-responsive genes, including a group of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, which is a general characteristic of malignancy. In addition, we identified a group of SS18-SSX2-responsive genes known to be specifically deregulated in primary synovial sarcomas, including IGF2 and CD44. Furthermore, we observed an uncoupling of EGR1, JUNB, and WNT signaling in response to SS18-SSX2 expression, suggesting that the SWI/SNF-associated coactivation functions of the SS18 moiety are impaired. Finally, we found that SS18-SSX2 expression affects histone modifications in the CD44 and IGF2 promoters and DNA methylation levels in the IGF2 imprinting control region. Together, we conclude that the SS18-SSX2 fusion protein may act as a so-called transcriptional \"activator-repressor,\" which induces downstream target gene deregulation through epigenetic mechanisms. Our results may have implications for both the development and clinical management of synovial sarcomas.",

The SS18 protein is thought to act as a transcriptional co-activator, whereas the SSX proteins are thought to act as transcriptional corepressors. The main SSX-repression domain is located in its C terminus, a domain that is retained in the respective SS18-SSX fusion proteins. Both the SS18 and SSX proteins lack DNA-binding domains. Previously, we found that the SS18 and SS18-SSX fusion proteins may be tethered to DNA targets via the SS18-interacting protein AF10. Here, we set out to isolate proteins that interact with the SSX C-terminal repression domain using a yeast two-hybrid interaction trap. Of the positive clones isolated, two corresponded to the LIM homeobox protein LHX4, a DNA-binding protein that is involved in transcription regulation. An endogenous interaction was subsequently established in mammalian cells via colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation of the respective proteins. Interestingly, the LHX4 gene was previously found to be deregulated in various human leukemias. In addition, it was previously found that LIM homeobox proteins may bind to and activate the glycoprotein-alpha (CGA) promoter. Using LHX4 chromatin immunoprecipitation and CGA-promoter assays, we found that endogenous LHX4 binds to the CGA promoter and that LHX4-mediated CGA activation is enhanced by the SS18-SSX protein, but not by the SSX protein. Taken together, we conclude that this novel protein - protein interaction may have direct consequences for the (de)regulation of SSX and/or SS18-SSX target genes and, thus, for the development of human synovial sarcomas.",

The expression of CTA in MHC class I-deficient germline cells makes these proteins particularly attractive as immunotherapeutic targets because they serve as essentially tumor-specific antigens for MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells. Moreover, because CTAs are expressed in many types of cancer, any therapeutic developed to target these antigens might have efficacy for multiple cancer types. Of particular interest among CTAs is the synovial sarcoma X chromosome breakpoint (SSX) family of proteins, which includes ten highly homologous family members. Expression of SSX proteins in tumor tissues has been associated with advanced stages of disease and worse patient prognosis. Additionally, both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to SSX proteins have been demonstrated in patients with tumors of varying histological origin, which indicates that natural immune responses can be spontaneously generated to these antigens in cancer patients.

In this study, we evaluated the expression of SSX family members in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor biopsies to identify which members might be most appropriate for immune targeting. We found that SSX2 was expressed most frequently in prostate cell lines, but that SSX1 and SSX5 were also expressed after treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Immunohistochemical analysis of microarrayed tissue biopsies confirmed a differential level of SSX protein expression in human prostate cancers. Notably, SSX expression in patient tumor samples was restricted to metastatic lesions (5/22; 23%) and no expression was detected in primary prostate tumors examined (0/73; P &lt; 0.001). We determined that cross-reactive immune responses to a dominant HLA-A2-specific SSX epitope (p103-111) could be elicited by immunization of A2/DR1 transgenic mice with SSX vaccines. Our findings suggest that multiple SSX family members are expressed in metastatic prostate cancers which are amenable to simultaneous targeting.",

However, detailed molecular players involved in formation of BBB are not completely known. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)-proteoglycan (PG), which is known to be involved in mineralization of bones and dentin, is also expressed in soft tissues including brain with unknown functions. In the present study, we reported that DMP1-PG was expressed in brain astrocytes and enriched in BBB units. The only glycosylation site of DMP1 is serine89 (S89) in the N-terminal domain of the protein in mouse. Mutant mice with DMP1 point mutations changing S89 to glycine (S89G), which completely eradicated glycosylation of the protein, demonstrated severe BBB disruption. Another breed of DMP1 mutant mice, which lacked the C-terminal domain of DMP1, manifested normal BBB function. The polarity of S89G-DMP1 astrocytes was disrupted and cell-cell adhesion was loosened. Through a battery of analyses, we found that DMP1 glycosylation was critically required for astrocyte maturation both in vitro and in vivo. S89G-DMP1 mutant astrocytes failed to express aquaporin 4 and had reduced laminin and ZO1 expression, which resulted in disruption of BBB. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type DMP1-PG in mouse brain driven by the nestin promoter elevated laminin and ZO1 expression beyond wild type levels and could effectively resisted intravenous mannitol-induced BBB reversible opening. Taken together, our study not only revealed a novel element, i.e., DMP1-PG, that regulated BBB formation, but also assigned a new function to DMP1-PG.",

Recently, the Yaa mutation was identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study, we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete, because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis, which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover, we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X chromosome.",

Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified <i>Hotair</i>, <i>Mir155hg</i>, as well as two new lncRNAs (<i>SR-lncRNA-1</i> and <i>SR-lncRNA-2</i>) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of <i>Hotair,</i> and increased the half-lives of <i>Mir155hg</i> and <i>SR-lncRNA-2</i>, while the stability of <i>SR-lncRNA-1</i> was unaffected. Depletion of <i>Hotair</i> and <i>SR-lncRNA-1</i> in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of <i>SR-lncRNA-2</i> in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

G-protein-coupled receptor 151 (GPR151) was reported to be expressed specifically in the habenular area. Here we report the expression and the epigenetic regulation of GRP151 in the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and the contribution of GPR151 to neuropathic pain in male mice. SNL dramatically increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. <i>GPR151</i> mutation or spinal inhibition by shRNA alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the CpG island in the <i>GPR151</i> gene promoter region was demethylated, the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was decreased, and the binding of DNMT3b with <i>GPR151</i> promoter was reduced after SNL. Overexpression of DNMT3b in the spinal cord decreased <i>GPR151</i> expression and attenuated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcriptional factor of the KLF family, was upregulated in spinal neurons, and the binding affinity of KLF5 with <i>GPR151</i> promoter was increased after SNL. Inhibition of KLF5 reduced <i>GPR151</i> expression and attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity. Further mRNA microarray analysis revealed that mutation of <i>GPR151</i> reduced the expression of a variety of pain-related genes in response to SNL, especially mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway-associated genes. This study reveals that GPR151, increased by DNA demethylation and the enhanced interaction with KLF5, contributes to the maintenance of neuropathic pain via increasing MAPK pathway-related gene expression.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targets of various clinically approved drugs. Here we report that SNL increased GPR151 expression in the spinal cord, and mutation or inhibition of GPR151 alleviated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. In addition, SNL downregulated the expression of DNMT3b, which caused demethylation of <i>GPR151</i> gene promoter, facilitated the binding of transcriptional factor KLF5 with the <i>GPR151</i> promoter, and further increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. The increased GPR151 may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain via activating MAPK signaling and increasing pain-related gene expression.

Consequently, the habenula may be critically important in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as addiction and depression. Here we investigated the expression pattern of GPR151, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), whose mRNA has been identified as highly and specifically enriched in habenular neurons by in situ hybridization and translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP). In the present immunohistochemical study we demonstrate a pronounced and highly specific expression of the GPR151 protein in the medial and lateral habenula of rodent brain. Specific expression was also seen in efferent habenular fibers projecting to the interpeduncular nucleus, the rostromedial tegmental area, the rhabdoid nucleus, the mesencephalic raphe nuclei, and the dorsal tegmental nucleus. Using confocal microscopy and quantitative colocalization analysis, we found that GPR151-expressing axons and terminals overlap with cholinergic, substance P-ergic, and glutamatergic markers. Virtually identical expression patterns were observed in rat, mouse, and zebrafish brains. Our data demonstrate that GPR151 is highly conserved, specific for a subdivision of the habenular neurocircuitry, and constitutes a promising novel target for psychiatric drug development.",

Only one LFS study was identified, highlighting the distinct lack of psychosocial research describing experiences of young people with LFS. Translatable evidence showed that familial factors strongly influenced young people's experiences of genetic testing and their mutation status. Major adverse reactions to genetic test results were rare, although young people with a gene mutation experienced various psychosocial concerns at key developmental milestones, including family planning, developing romantic relationships, and making risk management decisions.

However, an accurate estimation of the penetrance of different cancer types in LFS is crucial to improve the clinical characterization and management of high-risk individuals. Here, we developed a competing risk-based statistical model that incorporates the pedigree structure efficiently into the penetrance estimation and corrects for ascertainment bias while also increasing the effective sample size of this rare population. This enabled successful estimation of <i>TP53</i> penetrance for three LFS cancer types: breast (BR), sarcoma (SA), and others (OT), from 186 pediatric sarcoma families collected at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Penetrance validation was performed on a combined dataset of two clinically ascertained family cohorts with cancer to overcome internal bias in each (total number of families = 668). The age-dependent onset probability distributions of specific cancer types were different. For breast cancer, the <i>TP53</i> penetrance went up at an earlier age than the reported <i>BRCA1/2</i> penetrance.

Although extremely rare, osteosarcoma has occasionally been observed in several members of the same family. No other clinical abnormalities in the proband or the affected members were reported. Pathologic examination of the tumors revealed no unusual features. Genetic testing was not available in most of these reports. The patients generally responded to conventional therapy. A genetic predisposition to osteosarcoma is found in patients with hereditary retinoblastoma, characterized by mutation of the retinoblastoma gene RB1 on chromosome 13q14. The Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with a heterogeneous clinical profile. Patients may have a few or multiple clinical features including skin rash, small stature, skeletal dysplasias, sparse or absent scalp hair, eyebrows or eyelashes, juvenile cataracts, and gastrointestinal disturbance including chronic emesis and diarrhea; its molecular basis is the mutation in the RECQL4 gene in a subset of cases. The Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a high risk of developing osteosarcoma and has been found in up to 3% of children with osteosarcoma. It is associated with a germline mutation of the p53, a suppressor gene. The following three criteria must be met for a diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome: (1) A proband diagnosed with sarcoma when younger than 45 years; (2) A first-degree relative with any cancer diagnosed when younger than 45 years; (3) Another first- or second-degree relative of the same genetic lineage with any cancer diagnosed when younger than 45 years or sarcoma diagnosed at any age. A second recessive p53 oncogene on chromosome 17p13.1 may also play a role in the development and progression of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma has also been associated with solitary or multiple osteochondroma, solitary enchondroma or enchondromatosis (Ollier's disease), multiple hereditary exostoses, fibrous dysplasia, chronic osteomyelitis, sites of bone infarcts, sites of metallic prostheses and sites of prior internal fixation. Ionizing radiation is a well-documented etiologic factor. Osteosarcoma has also been associated with the use of intravenous radium and Thorotrast. Exposure to alkylating agents may also contribute to its development ,and it is apparently independent of the administration of radiotherapy.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30588330": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant condition that predisposes individuals to a wide-spectrum of tumors at an early age. Approximately 70% of families with classic LFS have pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor gene <i>TP53</i> that disrupt protein function or stability. While more than 70% of pathogenic variants in <i>TP53</i> are missense variants, the vast majority occur very infrequently, and thus their clinical significance is uncertain or conflicting. Here, we report an extremely rare <i>TP53</i> missense variant, c.799C &gt; T (p.Arg267Trp), identified in a 2-year-old Saudi proband diagnosed with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) and six of his first- and second-degree relatives. CPC is frequently found in families with LFS, and this is the first detailed report of a family with this variant. Intriguingly, the proband's father is homozygous for <i>TP53</i> c.799C &gt; T and phenotypically normal at 39 years of age. While loss of <i>TP53</i> heterozygosity is often observed in tumors from individuals with LFS, homozygous germline <i>TP53</i> pathogenic variants are rare. Based on our analysis of this single family, we hypothesize that <i>TP53</i> c.799C &gt; T has low or variable penetrance for LFS, with predisposition to the development of CPC. The observations from this family have furthered our understanding of the phenotypic variability that may be caused by one variant of <i>TP53</i>, even in the same family, and suggest that other factors (genetic and/or environmental) may play a role in mechanism of disease manifestation in LFS.",

Approximately 70% of LFS cases contain germline mutations in the TP53 gene. We report a case of a family suspected of LFS. The proband and four members of the family affected were diagnosed with cancer at an early age and they all died except the proband. Exons 5-9 from TP53 gene were analysed by direct amplification and sequencing in 7 family members. The analysis revealed a germline nonsense mutation in exon 8 at codon 306 of the codified region of the TP53 gene, causing a change of CGA to TGA (Arg\u2192Stop) in the proband, her mother, her cousin and her maternal uncle. Proband's maternal grandmother and aunt do not have the mutation. The members of this family that were studied meet the criteria of classic LFS and the described mutation increases their susceptibility to develop cancer. The proband's maternal grandfather died of lung cancer in 1993, and we believe that he was the carrier of the mutation in this family.",

A systematic, English-language MEDLINE search (1966-August 2010) was conducted using the search terms belimumab, Benlysta, B-lymphocyte stimulators, BLyS-specific inhibitors, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Press releases and bibliographies were reviewed for additional information and citations. Belimumab was first identified and studied as a human protein target in 1999. Therefore, all published clinical trials and abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of belimumab for treatment of SLE as well as review articles from 1999 to present were evaluated for inclusion. Additional data were extracted from the manufacturer's Web site and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents. Current therapies for SLE target nonspecific sites for inflammatory reduction and immune system suppression. Belimumab is a target-specific, human IgG1\u03bb monoclonal B-lymphocyte stimulator inhibitor currently in late stage investigation for the treatment of SLE. Unpublished Phase 3 trials have reported statistically significant results for primary endpoints when belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care was compared to placebo plus standard of care in seropositive patients with SLE. Overall, belimumab has been relatively well tolerated with discontinuation rates and adverse events similar to those of placebo. If belimumab is approved by the FDA, its US market launch would be expected in 2011. Belimumab has shown significant benefits for patients with SLE in the few Phase 3 trials that have been published.

Belimumab, an anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody, was approved by the FDA for use in treating systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the molecular basis of BAFF neutralization by belimumab remains unclear. Here our crystal structure of the BAFF-belimumab Fab complex shows the precise epitope and the BAFF-neutralizing mechanism of belimumab, and demonstrates that the therapeutic activity of belimumab involves not only antagonizing the BAFF-receptor interaction, but also disrupting the formation of the more active BAFF 60-mer to favor the induction of the less active BAFF trimer through interaction with the flap region of BAFF. In addition, the belimumab HCDR3 loop mimics the DxL(V/L) motif of BAFF receptors, thereby binding to BAFF in a similar manner as endogenous BAFF receptors. Our data thus provides insights for the design of new drugs targeting BAFF for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

In some patients, the response is inadequate and side effects appear from mild unpleasant up to severe toxicity. Drug metabolism and clearance may be severely compromised. Therefore, it is a priority to develop better treatments with fewer adverse events that can be used at different stages of disease activity. In recent years, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, soluble human B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein (BLyS), also referred to as B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and TNFSF13B has been studied extensively. This protein is synthesized by myeloid cell lines, specifically interacts with B lymphocytes and increases their life-span. BlyS plays a key role in the selection, maturation and survival of B cells and it has a significant role in the pathogenesis of SLE.

The finding that selection and survival of B cells are controlled by a variety of signals, including those provided by the longevity factor BAFF (B-cell activating factor), also called BLyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator), led to preclinical trials that revealed that BAFF represents a promising therapeutic target for human lupus. Belimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against BAFF. Lessons learned from early clinical trials led to improved methods and success of phase III trials, with recruitment of patients with both clinically and serologically active disease, development and use of a novel SLE Responder Index, and progressive and special restrictions on immunosuppressive and corticosteroid use. These studies offer an attractive blueprint to conduct future clinical trials in SLE. The overall steroid-sparing ability and benefits of belimumab on musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous organ systems suggest that it has an impact on the clinical management of SLE patients.

Pre-clinical experimentation in murine models of SLE as well as observational studies in human SLE provided sufficient evidence to support the use of an inhibitor of BLyS as a novel therapy to reduce SLE disease activity. Progressing from phase I through a robust phase III program was no easy task given the complexities of SLE trial design. These challenges were overcome with the implementation of strict study entry requirements, the development of a novel responder index, and rigorous rules regarding background therapies. The success of two phase III studies and the approval of belimumab by the US Food and Drug Administration represent an unprecedented milestone in the history of SLE drug development. Belimumab was the first drug approved in SLE in over 50 years and was the first drug ever approved in SLE through the conventional route of randomized controlled trials.

We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the EEG criteria proposed by a panel of experts at the fourth London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus in Salzburg, 2013 (henceforth called the Salzburg criteria). We did a retrospective, diagnostic accuracy study using EEG recordings from patients admitted for neurological symptoms or signs to three centres in two countries (Danish Epilepsy Centre, Dianalund, Denmark; Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark; and Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria). Participants were included from the Danish centres if they were aged 4 months or older, and from the Austrian centre if aged 18 years or older. Participants were sorted into two groups: consecutive patients under clinical suspicion of having NCSE (the clinical validation group) or consecutive patients with abnormal EEG findings but no clinical suspicion of NCSE (the control group). Two raters blinded to all other patient data retrospectively analysed the EEG recordings and, using the Salzburg criteria, categorised patients as in NCSE or not in NCSE. By comparing with a reference standard inferred from all clinical and para-clinical data, therapeutic response, and the final outcome, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, overall diagnostic accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, and inter-rater agreement for the Salzburg criteria.

We retrospectively analyzed the EEGs of 50 consecutive nonhypoxic patients with diagnoses of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) at discharge and 50 consecutive controls with abnormal EEGs in a large university hospital in Austria. We implemented the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology, 2012 version (ACNS criteria) to increase the test performance of SCNC. In patients without preexisting epileptic encephalopathy, the following criteria were applied: (1) more than 25 epileptiform discharges (ED) per 10-second epoch, i.e., &gt;2.5/s and (2) patients with EDs \u2264 2.5/s or rhythmic delta/theta activity (RDT) exceeding 0.5/s AND at least one of the additional criteria: (2a) clinical and EEG improvements from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), (2b) subtle clinical phenomena, or (2c) typical spatiotemporal evolution. In case of fluctuation without evolution or EEG improvement without clinical improvement, \"possible NCSE\" was diagnosed. For identification of RDT, the following criteria were compared: (test condition A) continuous delta-theta activity without further rules, (B) ACNS criterion for rhythmic delta activity (RDA), and (C) ACNS criteria for RDA and fluctuation. False positive rate in controls dropped from 28% (condition A) to 2% (B) (p = 0.00039) and finally to 0% (C) (p = 0.000042).

Possible NCSE was diagnosed based on fluctuations in 57.1% and EEG improvement without clinical improvement in 14.2%.

Patients in deep coma may exhibit epileptiform EEG patterns, such as generalized periodic spikes, and there is an ongoing debate about the relationship of these patterns and NCSE. The purposes of this review are (i) to discuss the various EEG patterns found in coma, its fluctuations, and transitions and (ii) to propose modified criteria for NCSE in coma. Classical coma patterns such as diffuse polymorphic delta activity, spindle coma, alpha/theta coma, low output voltage, or burst suppression do not reflect NCSE. Any ictal patterns with a typical spatiotemporal evolution or epileptiform discharges faster than 2.5 Hz in a comatose patient reflect nonconvulsive seizures or NCSE and should be treated. Generalized periodic diacharges or lateralized periodic discharges (GPDs/LPDs) with a frequency of less than 2.5 Hz or rhythmic discharges (RDs) faster than 0.5 Hz are the borderland of NCSE in coma. In these cases, at least one of the additional criteria is needed to diagnose NCSE (a) subtle clinical ictal phenomena, (b) typical spatiotemporal evolution, or (c) response to antiepileptic drug treatment. There is currently no consensus about how long these patterns must be present to qualify for NCSE, and the distinction from nonconvulsive seizures in patients with critical illness or in comatose patients seems arbitrary.

Furthermore, the clinical outcome for patients not diagnosed using SCC (false-negatives) was examined. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus or possible NCSE was diagnosed in 40 patients by the inexperienced reader using the SCC, blinded to other clinical data, and in 47 patients by the experienced reader, not blinded to the clinical data, who did not use SCC. There were eight false-negatives, one false-positive, 39 true-positives, and 236 true-negatives.

Our aim was to evaluate the role of 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and quantitative HMPAO-SPECT (QtSPECT) in patients with clinical suspicion of NCSE, and to evaluate their value in the final diagnosis of NCSE. We recruited consecutive patients admitted in our center with suspicion of NCSE, and selected those who underwent an HMPAO-SPECT. All patients were admitted to the neurology ward and underwent an EEG. We divided the patients into those who were finally with diagnosed NCSE (NCSE-p) and those who were not (non-NCSE) according to the Salzburg Diagnostic EEG criteria. Sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tools were calculated. The SPECTs were acquired in a Skylight SPECT (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam). The injections were done during the clinical episode suspected of being an NCSE. The HMPAO-SPECT was analyzed by two experts and was also quantified. All data were normalized to the SPM SPECT template. We used an external healthy normal database to obtain a Z-score map for each individual versus the normal database. The Z-score maximum (Z<sub>max</sub>) was extracted from each region of the AAL atlas as was the percentage of voxels with a Z-score higher than 2.5 (N(%)). A logistic regression combining the Z<sub>max</sub>, N(%), and the effect of patient age was fitted to predict the final NCSE diagnosis. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the classification performance. We included 55 patients, 21 of them women (38.9%), with a median age of 62.1 years old (range 25-84). Thirty-six patients were with diagnosed NCSE (62.9%). Initial EEG had a sensitivity of 61.1% and a specificity of 89%. Most of the patients were critically ill with diagnostic difficulties, and it could be one of the main reasons to find low sensitivity of the Salzburg diagnostic EEG criteria.

We define the roles of Mll4/COMPASS and its catalytic activity in the maintenance and exit of ground-state pluripotency in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mll4 is required for ESC to exit the naive pluripotent state; however, its intrinsic catalytic activity is dispensable for this process. The depletion of the H3K4 demethylase Lsd1 (Kdm1a) restores the ability of Mll4 null ESCs to transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Thus, we define an opposing regulatory axis, wherein Lsd1 and associated co-repressors directly repress Mll4-activated gene targets. This finding has broad reaching implications for human developmental syndromes and the treatment of tumors carrying Mll4 mutations.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29785026": "The lysine methyltransferase KMT2C (also known as MLL3), a subunit of the COMPASS complex, implements monomethylation of Lys4 on histone H3 (H3K4) at gene enhancers. KMT2C (hereafter referred to as MLL3) frequently incurs point mutations across a range of human tumor types, but precisely how these lesions alter MLL3 function and contribute to oncogenesis is unclear. Here we report a cancer mutational hotspot in MLL3 within the region encoding its plant homeodomain (PHD) repeats and demonstrate that this domain mediates association of MLL3 with the histone H2A deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1. Cancer-associated mutations in the sequence encoding the MLL3 PHD repeats disrupt the interaction between MLL3 and BAP1 and correlate with poor patient survival. Cancer cells that had PHD-associated MLL3 mutations or lacked BAP1 showed reduced recruitment of MLL3 and the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) to gene enhancers. As a result, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in tumor cells harboring BAP1 or MLL3 mutations restored normal gene expression patterns and impaired cell proliferation in vivo. This study provides mechanistic insight into the oncogenic effects of PHD-associated mutations in MLL3 and suggests that restoration of a balanced state of Polycomb-COMPASS activity may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors that bear mutations in the genes encoding these epigenetic factors.",

Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is commonly associated with transcriptional activation of genes. H3K4 methylation in mammalian cells is carried out by COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1)-like complexes that are composed of catalytic subunits such as MLL1 (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) and multiple regulatory subunits in which WDR5 (WD40 repeat-containing protein 5), RBBP5 (retinoblastoma-binding protein 5), ASH2 (absent, small or homoeotic discs 2) and DPY30 [constituting the WRAD sub-complex (WDR5-ASH2-RBBP5-DPY30 complex)] are the major ones shared from yeast to metazoans. We report, in the present paper, a new mode of spatial regulation of H3K4 methyltransferase complexes. PAQR3 (progestin and adipoQ receptors member 3), a tumour suppressor specifically localized in the Golgi apparatus, negatively regulates H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in mammalian cells. Consistently, HOXC8 and HOXA9 gene expression was negatively regulated by PAQR3 expression levels. Hypoxia-induced H3K4me3 was augmented by PAQR3 knockdown and suppressed by PAQR3 overexpression in AGS gastric cancer cells. PAQR3 was able to interact directly or indirectly with the four members of the WRAD sub-complex and tether them to the Golgi apparatus, accompanied by reduction in histone methyltransferase activity in the nucleus. PAQR3 also interfered with the interaction of WDR5 with the C-terminus of MLL1 (C-ter). Collectively, our study indicates that PAQR3 negatively modulates H3K4 methylation via altering the subcellular compartmentalization of the core regulatory subunits of the COMPASS-like complexes in mammalian cells.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elicits strong pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages through the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. The epigenetic mechanism underlying LPS-induced pro-inflammatory transcription is not fully understood. Herein, we describe a role for myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A, also known as MKL1) in this process. MRTF-A overexpression enhanced NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-inflammatory transcription, whereas MRTF-A silencing inhibited this process. MRTF-A deficiency also reduced the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators in a mouse model of colitis. LPS promoted the recruitment of MRTF-A to the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Reciprocally, MRTF-A influenced the nuclear enrichment and target binding of NF-\u03baB. Mechanistically, MRTF-A was necessary for the accumulation of active histone modifications on NF-\u03baB target promoters by communicating with the histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex (COMPASS). Silencing of individual members of COMPASS, including ASH2, WDR5 and SET1 (also known as SETD1A), downregulated the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and impaired the NF-\u03baB kinetics. In summary, our work has uncovered a previously unknown function for MRTF-A and provided insights into the rationalized development of anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies.",

For each lesion, the central vein sign was evaluated according to consensus guidelines. For each patient, lesion count, volume, and brain location, as well as fulfillment of dissemination in space MRI criteria, were assessed. MS showed higher frequency of perivenular lesions (median = 88%) than did inflammatory CNS vasculopathies (14%), without overlap between groups or differences between 3T and 1.5T MRI. Among inflammatory vasculopathies, Beh\u00e7et disease showed the highest median frequency of perivenular lesions (34%), followed by PACNS (14%), antiphospholipid syndromes (12%), Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (11%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0%).

The presence of a central vein in white matter lesions on susceptibility-weighted imaging, defined as a thin hypointense line or a small dot, was recorded. The proportion of lesions with the CVS was higher in MS than NMOSD (80% vs 32%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A greater proportion of lesions with the CVS predicted the diagnosis of MS, rather than NMOSD (odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.16, <i>p</i> = 0.001), suggesting that each percent unit increase in the proportion of lesions with the CVS in an individual patient was associated with a 10% increase in the risk of the same patient having MS.

This large multicenter, cross-sectional study enrolled participants (n = 648) of ongoing observational studies and patients included in neuroimaging research databases of 8 neuroimaging centers in Europe. Patient enrollment and MRI data collection were performed between January 1, 2010, and November 30, 2016. Data analysis was conducted between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2018. Investigators were blinded to participant diagnosis by a novel blinding procedure. Occurrence of central vein sign was detected on 3T T2*-weighted or susceptibility-weighted imaging. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed for these MRI sequences and for different central vein sign lesion criteria, which were defined by the proportion of lesions with central vein sign or by absolute numbers of lesions with central vein sign. A total of 606 participants were included in the study after exclusion of 42 participants. Among the 606 participants, 413 (68.2%) were women. Patients with clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) included 235 women (66.6%) and had a median (range) age of 37 (14.7-61.4) years, a median (range) disease duration of 2 (0-33) years, and a median (range) Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 1.5 (0-6.5). Patients without MS included 178 women (70.4%) and had a median (range) age of 54 (18-83) years. A total of 4447 lesions were analyzed in a total of 487 patients: 690 lesions in 98 participants with clinically isolated syndrome, 2815 lesions in 225 participants with RRMS, 54 lesions in 13 participants with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, 54 lesions in 14 participants with systemic lupus erythematosus, 121 lesions in 29 participants with migraine or cluster headache, 240 lesions in 20 participants with diabetes, and 473 lesions in 88 participants with other types of small-vessel disease.

Materials and methods T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images of 19 MS patients and 19 patients affected by CSVD were analysed for the presence and localisation of focal hyperintense white matter lesions. Lesions were subdivided into periventricular or non-periventricular (juxtacortical, subcortical, deep white matter and cerebellar) distributed. The number and localisation of lesions presenting with the central vein sign were recorded and compared between MS and CSVD lesions. Results A total of 313 MS patients and 75 CSVD lesions were identified on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images. The central vein sign was found in 128 MS lesions (40.9%), and the majority of them (71/128, 55.5%) had a periventricular distribution. The central vein sign was found in 22 out of 75 (29.3%) CSVD lesions, and periventricular distribution was seen in six out of 22 (27.2%) CSVD lesions. The difference in the proportion of white matter hyperintense lesions that presented with the central vein sign on susceptibility-weighted images in patients with MS and CSVD was statistically different, and a significantly higher number of MS patients presented with lesions with the central vein sign compared to CSVD patients. Conclusion The presence of the central vein sign on susceptibility-weighted images for MS lesions improves the understanding of the periventricular distribution of MS lesions and could contribute as adjunctive diagnostic criteria for MS disease.",

In this prospective pilot study, we recruited individuals with symptoms unusual for MS but with brain MRI consistent with the disease, and those with a typical clinical presentation of MS whose MRI did not suggest MS. We calculated the proportion of lesions with central veins for each patient and compared the results to the eventual clinical diagnoses. The optimal central vein threshold for diagnosis was established. Thirty-eight patients were scanned, 35 of whom have received a clinical diagnosis. Median percentage of lesions with central veins was 51% in MS and 28% in non-MS. A threshold of 40.7% lesions with central veins resulted in 100% sensitivity and 73.9% specificity.

Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with MS have higher proportions of white matter lesions with the central vein sign compared with those with diseases that mimic MS on MR imaging. However, the clinical application of the central vein sign as a biomarker is limited by interrater differences in the adjudication of the central vein sign as well as the time burden required for the determination of the central vein sign for each lesion in a patient's full MR imaging scan. In this study, we present an automated technique for the detection of the central vein sign in white matter lesions. Using multimodal MR imaging, the proposed method derives a central vein sign probability, \u03c0<sub>ij</sub>, for each lesion, as well as a patient-level central vein sign biomarker, \u03c8<sub>i</sub>. The method is probabilistic in nature, allows site-specific lesion segmentation methods, and is potentially robust to intersite variability.

Our objective was to determine if the central vein sign is reliably present in MS and absent in patients with ischemic small vessel disease (SVD) across different T2* sequences at 3T MRI. Ten patients with MS and 10 with SVD were each scanned on a 3 T Philips and GE scanner. The MRI protocol included 3-dimensional (3D) T2* GRE, T2* with high echo planar imaging (EPI) factor and susceptibility-weighted angiography (SWAN). Total WML numbers, central vein numbers, and proportion of WMLs with central veins were calculated using each sequence. Three blinded raters identified a subset of six WMLs with central veins to diagnose MS or SVD. Irrespective of the sequence, MS patients were identified based on a higher proportion of WMLs with central veins. This proportion was dependent on the T2* sequence used. T2* with high EPI allowed the highest median proportion (69.6%) in MS patients; 6.1% in SVD patients (P &lt; .0004). Rater reproducibility varied depending on the T2* sequence used. T2* with high EPI produced good agreement with the clinical diagnosis (Cohen's kappa range; .78-.89), as did SWAN imaging with some raters; \u0138 = .69.

These cells, acquired non-invasively, represent a sample of highly relevant tumor tissue that is an alternative to difficult and low-yield tumor biopsies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in genomic profiling of CTCs to enable longitudinal monitoring of the tumor's adaptive response to therapy. However, due to their extreme rarity, genotyping CTCs has proved challenging. Relevant mutations can be masked by leukocyte contamination in isolates. Heterogeneity between subpopulations of tumor cells poses an additional obstacle. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing can overcome these limitations but isolation of single CTCs is prone to cell loss and is prohibitively difficult and time consuming. To address these limitations, we developed a single cell sample preparation and genome sequencing pipeline that combines biophysical enrichment and single cell isolation using laser capture microdissection (LCM). A key component of this process is the encapsulation of enriched CTC sample in a hydrogel matrix, which enhances the efficiency of single-cell isolation by LCM, and is compatible with downstream sequencing. We validated this process by sequencing of single CTCs and cell free DNA (cfDNA) from a single patient with castration resistant prostate cancer. Identical mutations were observed in prostate cancer driver genes (TP53, PTEN, FOXA1) in both single CTCs and cfDNA. However, two independently isolated CTCs also had identical missense mutations in the genes for ATR serine/threonine kinase, KMT2C histone methyltransferase, and FANCC DNA damage repair gene. These mutations may be missed by bulk sequencing libraries, whereas single cell sequencing could potentially enable the characterization of key CTC subpopulations that arise during metastasis.",

We demonstrate that in these mouse hearts desmin loses its normal Z disk and intercalated disc localization and presents aggregate formation along with mislocalization of basic intercalated disc protein components, as well as severe structural abnormalities of the intercalated discs and mitochondria. To address the extent by which the observed desmin network defects contribute to the progression of Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup> cardiomyopathy, we investigated the consequences of desmin-targeted approaches for the disease treatment. We showed that cardiac-specific overexpression of the small heat shock protein \u03b1\u0392-Crystallin confers cardioprotection in Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup> mice by ameliorating desmin network defects and by attenuating the desmin-dependent mislocalization of basic intercalated disc protein components. In addition, \u03b1\u0392-Crystallin overexpression rescues the intercalated disc, mitochondrial and nuclear defects of Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup> hearts, as well as the abnormal activation of ERK1/2. Consistent with that, by generating the Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup>Des+/- mice, we showed that the genetically decreased endogenous desmin levels have cardioprotective effects in Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup> hearts since less desmin is available to form dysfunctional aggregates. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that desmin network disruption, disorganization of intercalated discs and mitochondrial defects are a major mechanism contributing to the progression of this LMNA cardiomyopathy and can be ameliorated by \u03b1\u0392-Crystallin overexpression.",

DCM is a complex disease and its pathological architecture encounters many genetic determinants interacting with environmental factors. The old perspective that every pathogenic gene mutation would lead to a diseased heart, is now being replaced by the novel observation that the phenotype depends not only on the penetrance-malignancy of the mutated gene-but also on epigenetics, age, toxic factors, pregnancy, and a diversity of acquired diseases. This review discusses how gene mutations will result in mutation-specific molecular alterations in the heart including increased mitochondrial oxidation (sarcomeric gene e.g. TTN), decreased calcium sensitivity (sarcomeric genes), fibrosis (e.g. LMNA and TTN), or inflammation. Therefore, getting a complete picture of the DCM patient will include genomic data, molecular assessment by preference from cardiac samples, stratification according to co-morbidities, and phenotypic description. Those data will help to better guide the heart failure and anti-arrhythmic treatment, predict response to therapy, develop novel siRNA-based gene silencing for malignant gene mutations, or intervene with mutation-specific altered gene pathways in the heart.This article is part of the Mini Review Series from the Varenna 2017 meeting of the Working Group of Myocardial Function of the European Society of Cardiology.",

Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, most frequently with autosomal-dominant inheritance. Five different loci that cosegregate with the disease have been mapped so far; the identification of the disease genes is still in progress. The only disease gene known so far is the dystrophin gene, which causes X-linked DC. By analogy with dystrophin, it is believed that other cytoskeletal proteins could be involved in the pathogenesis of DC. Finally, in right ventricular cardiomyopathy, a peculiar form of cardiomyopathy that is frequently familial as well, several disease loci have been described. Also in this case, no disease gene has been yet identified. The advances in clinical and molecular genetics of DC have relevant clinical and therapeutic implications.",

CRMP2 is implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, in vivo functions of CRMP2 remain unknown. We generated CRMP2 gene-deficient (crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> ) mice and examined their behavioral phenotypes. During 24-h home cage monitoring, the activity level during the dark phase of crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was significantly higher than that of wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, the time during the open arm of an elevated plus maze was longer for crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice than for WT mice. The duration of social interaction was shorter for crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice than for WT mice. Crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice also showed mild impaired contextual learning. We then examined the methamphetamine-induced behavioral change of crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed increased methamphetamine-induced ambulatory activity and serotonin release. Crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice also showed altered expression of proteins involved in GABAergic synapse, glutamatergic synapse and neurotrophin signaling pathways. In addition, SNAP25, RAB18, FABP5, ARF5 and LDHA, which are related genes to schizophrenia and methamphetamine sensitization, are also decreased in crmp2<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

SNAP-25 gene is associated with behavioral symptoms, personality and psychological disorders. In addition, SNAP-25 protein can be related to different neurotransmitter functions due to its association with vesicle membrane transition and fusion. This is important because neurologic, cognitive, and psychologic disorders in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) can be related to this function. This relationship may be enlightening for etiopathogenesis of FMS and treatment approaches. We aimed to study a SNAP-25 gene polymorphism, which is related to many psychiatric diseases, and FMS association in this prospective study. We included 71 patients who were diagnosed according to new criteria and 57 matched healthy women in this study. Both groups were evaluated regarding age, height, weight, BMI, education level, marital and occupational status. A new diagnosis of FMS was made from criteria scoring, SF-36, Beck depression scale, and VAS that were applied to the patient group. SNAP-25 gene polymorphism and disease activity score correlations were compared. Mean age was 38\u00b15,196 and 38.12\u00b14.939 in patient and control groups, respectively (p=0.542). No significant difference was found between groups regarding age, height, weight, BMI, education level, marital or occupational status (p &gt; 0.05). Ddel T/C genotype was significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.009). MnlI gene polymorphism did not show a correlation with any score whereas a significant correlation was found between Ddel T/C genotype and Beck depression scale and VAS score (p &lt; 0.05). FMS etiopathogenesis is not clearly known. Numerous neurologic, cognitive and psychological disorders were found during studies looking at cause. Our study showed increased SNAP-25 Ddel T/C genotype in FMS patients compared to the control group, which is related to behavioral symptoms, personality and psychological disorders in FMS patients.",

Monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders which showed autistic behavior patterns have suggested synaptic dysfunction, as a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of ASD. Subsequently, genes involved in synaptic signaling have been investigated with a priority for candidate gene studies. A synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) gene plays a crucial role in the central nervous system, contributing to exocytosis by targeting and fusion of vesicles to the cell membrane. Studies have shown a correlation between aberrant expression of the SNAP25 and a variety of brain diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene are associated with several psychiatric diseases, such as bipolar, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether polymorphisms (rs3746544 and rs1051312) in the regulatory 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of the SNAP25 gene have an association with ASD in unrelated Iranian case (N = 524)-control (N = 472) samples. We observed robust association of the rs3746544 SNP and ASD patients, in both allele and haplotype-based analyses. Our results supported the previous observations and indicated a possible role for SNAP25 polymorphisms as susceptibility genetic factors involved in developing ASD.",

Polymorphic variants of the SNAP-25 gene emerged as putative genetic components of impulsivity, as SNAP-25 protein plays an important role in the central nervous system, and its SNPs are associated with several psychiatric disorders. In this study we aimed to investigate if polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the SNAP-25 gene are in association with normal variability of impulsivity. Genotypes and haplotypes of two polymorphisms in the promoter (rs6077690 and rs6039769) and two SNPs in the 3' UTR (rs3746544 and rs1051312) of the SNAP-25 gene were determined in a healthy Hungarian population (N = 901) using PCR-RFLP or real-time PCR in combination with sequence specific probes. Significant association was found between the T-T 3' UTR haplotype and impulsivity, whereas no association could be detected with genotypes or haplotypes of the promoter loci. According to sequence alignment, the polymorphisms in the 3' UTR of the gene alter the binding site of microRNA-641, which was analyzed by luciferase reporter system. It was observed that haplotypes altering one or two nucleotides in the binding site of the seed region of microRNA-641 significantly increased the amount of generated protein in vitro. These findings support the role of polymorphic SNAP-25 variants both at psychogenetic and molecular biological levels.",

SNAP-25 protein expression is lower in different brain areas of schizophrenic patients and in ADHD mouse models. How the reduced expression of SNAP-25 alters the properties of synaptic transmission, leading to a pathological phenotype, is unknown. We show that, unexpectedly, halved SNAP-25 levels at 13-14 DIV not only fail to impair synaptic transmission but instead enhance evoked glutamatergic neurotransmission. This effect is possibly dependent on presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel activity and is not accompanied by changes in spontaneous quantal events or in the pool of readily releasable synaptic vesicles. Notably, synapses of 13-14 DIV neurons with reduced SNAP-25 expression show paired-pulse depression as opposed to paired-pulse facilitation occurring in their wild-type counterparts. This phenotype disappears with synapse maturation. As alterations in short-term plasticity represent a new mechanism contributing to cognitive impairments in intellectual disabilities, our data provide mechanistic clues for neuronal circuit alterations in psychiatric diseases characterized by reduced expression of SNAP-25.",

The location of this niche varies across species, but the evolutionary pressures that drive HSPCs to different microenvironments remain unknown. The niche is located in the bone marrow in adult mammals, whereas it is found in other locations in non-mammalian vertebrates, for example, in the kidney marrow in teleost fish. Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression. The umbrella of melanocytes associated with the haematopoietic niche is highly evolutionarily conserved in aquatic animals, including the sea lamprey, a basal vertebrate. During the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, HSPCs relocated into the bone marrow, which is protected from ultraviolet light by the cortical bone around the marrow. Our studies reveal that melanocytes above the haematopoietic niche protect HSPCs from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage in aquatic vertebrates and suggest that during the transition to terrestrial life, ultraviolet light was an evolutionary pressure affecting the location of the haematopoietic niche.",

In this study, we find that expression of Bik/Blk/Nbk is increased in human airway epithelial cells (AECs [HAECs]) in response to IFNgamma. Expression of Bik but not mutant BikL61G induces and loss of Bik suppresses IFNgamma-induced cell death in HAECs. IFNgamma treatment and Bik expression increase cathepsin B and D messenger RNA levels and reduce levels of phospho-extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the nuclei of bik(+/+) compared with bik(-/-) murine AECs. Bik but not BikL61G interacts with and suppresses nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK1/2, and suppression of ERK1/2 activation inhibits IFNgamma- and Bik-induced cell death. Furthermore, after prolonged exposure to allergen, hyperplastic epithelial cells persist longer, and nuclear phospho-ERK is more prevalent in airways of IFNgamma(-/-) or bik(-/-) compared with wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that IFNgamma requires Bik to suppress nuclear localization of phospho-ERK1/2 to channel cell death in AECs.",

We aimed to replicate the association of these genes with SLE in Chinese Han and to search for possible gene-gene interactions. TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was used to detect rs548234, rs665791 in ATG5, rs11706903 in ATG7, rs2736340 in BLK and rs10516487 in BANK1 in 382 SLE patients and 660 healthy controls. The epistasis effect was analyzed by logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and linear regression analysis. SLE was associated with frequency of rs548234 (P = 0.010; odds ratio [OR] = 1.298), rs2736340 (P = 2.47 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> ; OR = 1.574) and rs10516487 (P = 0.002; OR = 0.642). Although no epistasis effects were found among three autophagy-related gene loci or with rs2736340 and rs10516487, BLK and BANK1 had the closest interaction effect on logistic regression analysis (P = 0.013; OR = 1.205), MDR (P &lt; 0.0001), and linear regression analysis (P = 0.0017; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.1806). The risk genotype TT of rs2736340 was associated with decreased messenger RNA level of BLK; BLK transcript level was lower in SLE patients than healthy controls. We confirmed the association of rs548234, rs2736340 and rs10516487 with SLE in Chinese Han and reinforced our hypothesis of their epistasis effect in regulating B-cell signaling in SLE.",

The proteins of these genes interact physically and work in concert during B-cell signaling. Little is know about their interactions with other B-cell signaling molecules or their role in the process. Using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) we sought for factors that interact with BANK1. We found that the molecular switch PLCg2 interacts with BANK1 and that the interaction is promoted by B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. We found further that the kinase activity of BLK enhanced BANK1- PLCg2 binding and that the interaction was suppressed upon BLK depletion. Immunoprecipitation and mutational analysis demonstrated that the interaction between BANK1 and PLCg2 was dependent on specific tyrosine and proline residues on the adaptor protein. Our results provide new information important to understand the role of these two genes in basic B-cell physiology and immune-related diseases.",

Although BLK has been reproducibly identified as a risk factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), reports are conflicting about the contribution of BANK1 to RA susceptibility. To ascertain the real impact of BANK1 on RA genetic susceptibility, we performed a large meta-analysis including our original data and tested for an epistatic interaction between BANK1 and BLK in RA susceptibility. We investigated data for 1,915 RA patients and 1,915 ethnically matched healthy controls genotyped for BANK1 rs10516487 and rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113. The association of each SNP and RA was tested by logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was then used with an interaction term to test for an epistatic interaction between the SNPs in the 2 genes. None of the SNPs tested individually was significantly associated with RA in the genotyped samples. However, we detected an epistatic interaction between BANK1 rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113 (P(interaction) = 0.037). In individuals carrying the BLK rs13277113 GG genotype, presence of the BANK1 rs3733197 G allele increased the risk of RA (odds ratio 1.21 [95% confidence interval 1.04-1.41], P = 0.015. Combining our results with those of all other studies in a large trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed an association of the BANK1 rs3733197 G allele and RA (1.11 [1.02-1.21], P = 0.012). This study confirms BANK1 as an RA susceptibility gene and for the first time provides evidence for epistasis between BANK1 and BLK in RA. Our results illustrate the concept of pleiotropic epistatic interaction, suggesting that BANK1 and BLK might play a role in RA pathogenesis.",

The genes BANK1 and BLK were recently described as associated with SLE. BANK1 codes for a B-cell-specific cytoplasmic protein involved in B-cell receptor signalling and BLK codes for an Src tyrosine kinase with important roles in B-cell development. To characterise the role of BANK1 and BLK in SLE, a genetic interaction analysis was performed hypothesising that genetic interactions could reveal functional pathways relevant to disease pathogenesis. The GPAT16 method was used to analyse the gene-gene interactions of BANK1 and BLK. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate co-localisation, and immunoprecipitation was used to verify the physical interaction of BANK1 and BLK. Epistatic interactions between BANK1 and BLK polymorphisms associated with SLE were observed in a discovery set of 279 patients and 515 controls from northern Europe. A meta-analysis with 4399 European individuals confirmed the genetic interactions between BANK1 and BLK. As BANK1 was identified as a binding partner of the Src tyrosine kinase LYN, the possibility that BANK1 and BLK could also show a protein-protein interaction was tested. The co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation of BLK and BANK1 were demonstrated. In a Daudi cell line and primary naive B cells endogenous binding was enhanced upon B-cell receptor stimulation using anti-IgM antibodies. This study shows a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and demonstrates that these molecules interact physically. The results have important consequences for the understanding of SLE and other autoimmune diseases and identify a potential new signalling pathway.",

We constructed the corresponding green fluorescent protein fusion proteins and studied their intracellular localization in COS-1 cells. We showed that 28 amino acids in the amino terminus of PPOX contain an independently functioning signal for mitochondrial targeting. The experiments with amino-terminally truncated green fluorescent protein fusion proteins revealed that amino acids 25-477 of PPOX contained an additional mitochondrial targeting signal(s). We constructed a structural model for the interaction between the amino-terminal end of PPOX and the putative mitochondrial receptor protein Tom20. The model suggests that leucine and isoleucine residues Leu-8, Ile-12, and Leu-15 forming an alpha-helical hydrophobic motif, LXXXIXXL, were crucial for the recognition of the targeting signal. The validity of the model was tested using mutants L8Q, I12T, and L15Q disrupting the hydrophobic surface of the LXXXIXXL helix. The results from in vitro expression studies and molecular modeling were in accordance supporting the hypothesis that the recognition of the mitochondrial targeting signal is dependent on hydrophobic interactions between the targeting signal and the mitochondrial receptor.",

Only H20P did not target, and of eight protoporphyrinogen oxidase-GFP chimeric fusion proteins created, N-terminal residues 1-17 were found to be the minimal protoporphyrinogen oxidase sequence required for efficient mitochondrial targeting. Removal of this N-terminal sequence displayed mitochondrial localization, suggesting internal mitochondrial targeting signals. In addition, six constructs were engineered to assess the effect of charge and helicity on mitochondrial targeting of the protein. Of those engineered, only the PPOX20/H20P-GFP construct abolished mitochondrial targeting, presumably through disruption of the protoporphyrinogen oxidase alpha-helix.

It has been proposed that the pathway for the biosynthesis of heme in Plasmodium falciparum is unique involving three different cellular compartments, namely mitochondrion, apicoplast and cytosol. Experimental evidences are now available for the functionality and localization of all the enzymes of this pathway, except protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PfPPO), the penultimate enzyme. In the present study, PfPPO has been cloned, expressed and shown to be localized to the mitochondrion by immunofluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, the enzyme has been found to be active only under anaerobic conditions and is dependent on electron transport chain (ETC) acceptors for its activity. The native enzyme present in the parasite is inhibited by the ETC inhibitors, atovaquone and antimycin. Atovaquone, a well known inhibitor of parasite dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, dependent on the ETC, inhibits synthesis of heme as well in P. falciparum culture.

This metabolic flexibility is essential to the maintenance of contractile function and is under the control of a group of select transcriptional regulators, notably the nuclear receptor family of factors member PPAR\u03b1. However, the diversity of physiologic and pathologic states through which the heart must sustain function suggests the possible existence of additional transcriptional regulators that play a role in matching cardiac metabolism to energetic demand. Here we show that cardiac KLF15 is required for the normal cardiac response to fasting. Specifically, we find that cardiac function is impaired upon fasting in systemic and cardiac specific Klf15-null mice. Further, cardiac specific Klf15-null mice display a fasting-dependent accumulation of long chain acylcarnitine species along with a decrease in expression of the carnitine translocase Slc25a20. Treatment with a diet high in short chain fatty acids relieves the KLF15-dependent long chain acylcarnitine accumulation and impaired cardiac function in response to fasting. Our observations establish KLF15 as a critical mediator of the cardiac adaptive response to fasting through its regulation of myocardial lipid utilization.",

The transport function of CACT is crucial for the \u03b2-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>. After treatment of the mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V <sub>max</sub> was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts, indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix. Prediction on the localization of acetylated residues by bioinformatics correlates well with the experimental data. Recombinant CACT treated with acetyl-CoA was partially acetylated by non-enzymatic mechanism with a corresponding decrease of transport activity. The experimental data indicate that acetylation of CACT inhibits its transport activity, and thus may contribute to the regulation of the mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation pathway.",

Primary safety outcome measures are the incidence of study product-related serious adverse events within 180 days, grade 3 solicited or unsolicited adverse events within 28 days, and solicited injection site and systemic reactogenicity on the day of study product administration through 7 days after administration, and secondary safety outcomes are new-onset chronic illnesses within 180 days and unsolicited adverse events within 28 days, all analysed by intention to treat. Secondary immunogenicity outcomes are antibody titres at day 28 and percentages of seroconversion and seroprotection, all determined by haemagglutination inhibition antibody assay. The trial is completed and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02438423\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02438423</a>. Between June 23, 2015, and Sept 25, 2015, 100 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, no treatment-related unsolicited grade 3 or higher adverse events, and no new-onset chronic illnesses. Among vaccinated groups (vaccine via health-care worker administered microneedle patch or intramuscular injection, or self-administered microneedle patch), overall incidence of solicited adverse events (n=89 vs n=73 vs n=73) and unsolicited adverse events (n=18 vs n=12 vs n=14) were similar. Reactogenicity was mild, transient, and most commonly reported as tenderness (15 [60%] of 25 participants [95% CI 39-79]) and pain (11 [44%] of 25 [24-65]) after intramuscular injection; and as tenderness (33 [66%] of 50 [51-79]), erythema (20 [40%] of 50 [26-55]), and pruritus (41 [82%] of 50 [69-91]) after vaccination by microneedle patch application. The geometric mean titres were similar at day 28 between the microneedle patch administered by a health-care worker versus the intramuscular route for the H1N1 strain (1197 [95% CI 855-1675] vs 997 [703-1415]; p=0\u00b75), the H3N2 strain (287 [192-430] vs 223 [160-312]; p=0\u00b74), and the B strain (126 [86-184] vs 94 [73-122]; p=0\u00b706). Similar geometric mean titres were reported in participants who self-administered the microneedle patch (all p&gt;0\u00b705). The seroconversion percentages were significantly higher at day 28 after microneedle patch vaccination compared with placebo (all p&lt;0\u00b70001) and were similar to intramuscular injection (all p&gt;0\u00b701). Use of dissolvable microneedle patches for influenza vaccination was well tolerated and generated robust antibody responses. National Institutes of Health.",

Here, using exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identified three de novo truncating mutations in WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) in five unrelated individuals with moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic features and seizures. WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C&gt;T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C&gt;T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C&gt;T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability.",

In this study we investigated the metabolism and disposition of pyrotinib in six healthy Chinese men after a single oral dose of 402 mg of [<sup>14</sup>C]pyrotinib. At 240 h postdose, the mean cumulative excretion of the dose radioactivity was 92.6%, including 1.7% in urine and 90.9% in feces. In feces, oxidative metabolites were detected as major drug-related materials and the primary metabolic pathways were O-depicoline (M1), oxidation of pyrrolidine (M5), and oxidation of pyridine (M6-1, M6-2, M6-3, and M6-4). In plasma, the major circulating entities identified were pyrotinib, SHR150980 (M1), SHR151468 (M2), and SHR151136 (M5), accounting for 10.9%, 1.9%, 1.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, of the total plasma radioactivity based on the AUC<sub>0-\u221e</sub> ratios. Approximately 58.3% of the total plasma radioactivity AUC<sub>0-\u221e</sub> was attributed to covalently bound materials. After incubation of human plasma with [<sup>14</sup>C]pyrotinib at 37 \u00b0C for 2, 5, 8, and 24 h, the recovery of radioactivity by extraction was 97.4%, 91.8%, 69.6%, and 46.7%, respectively, revealing covalent binding occurred independently of enzymes. A group of pyrotinib adducts, including pyrotinib-lysine and pyrotinib adducts of the peptides Gly-Lys, Lys-Ala, Gly-Lys-Ala, and Lys-Ala-Ser, was identified after HCl hydrolysis of the incubated plasma. Therefore, the amino acid residue Lys190 of human serum albumin was proposed to covalently bind to pyrotinib via Michael addition.

Patients and Methods Pyrotinib was administered continuously, orally, once per day to patients who did not have prior exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of HER2. Planned dose escalation was 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 mg. For pharmacokinetic analysis, timed blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 28. Next-generation sequencing was performed on circulating tumor DNA and genomic DNA from tumor samples. Results Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 diarrhea, which occurred in two patients administered 480 mg of pyrotinib; thus, the maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg. Common pyrotinib-related adverse events included diarrhea (44.7% [17 of 38]), nausea (13.2% [five of 38]), oral ulceration (13.2% [five of 38]), asthenia (10.5% [four of 38]), and leukopenia (10.5% [four of 38]). The only grade 3 adverse event was diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pyrotinib exposure was dose dependent. The overall response rate was 50.0% (18 of 36), and the clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease \u2265 24 weeks) was 61.1% (22 of 36). The median progression-free survival was 35.4 weeks (95% CI, 23.3 to 40.0 weeks). The overall response rate was 83.3% (10 of 12) in trastuzumab-naive patients and 33.3% (eight of 24) in trastuzumab-pretreated patients. Preliminary results suggest that PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in circulating tumor DNA ( P = .013) rather than in archival tumor tissues ( P = .474) may predict the efficacy of pyrotinib. Conclusion Continuous once-per-day pyrotinib was well tolerated and demonstrated promising antitumor activity in HER2-positive patients with metastatic breast cancer. The maximum tolerated dose was established as 400 mg. Diarrhea was the dose-limiting toxicity. The promising antitumor activity and acceptable tolerability of pyrotinib warrant its further evaluation in a phase II study.",

The results of phase I clinical trial demonstrated that pyrotinib was well tolerated and exhibited potent antitumor activity. As a promising therapeutic agent for HER2-positive breast cancer, it is of great importance to investigate the biotransformation of pyrotinib in humans and identify the major enzymes involved in its metabolism during its early stage of development for safety consideration. For this purpose, a robust analytical method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) was established to characterize the metabolites of pyrotinib in human plasma, feces, and urine, and identify the primary enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As a result, a total of 24 metabolites were identified, including 16 phase I metabolites resulting from dealkylation, oxidation, dehydrogenation, and carbonylation, and 8 phase II metabolites originating from cysteine and N-acetylcysteine conjugation. Pyrotinib was absorbed into blood by 1h, reached its peak level at 4h, and afterwards underwent slow elimination. The principal metabolites detected in humans (M1, M2, and M5) were products resulting from O-depicoline and pyrrolidine lactam formation, whose structures have been confirmed by the synthetic references. In addition, fecal clearance was the major route of excretion for pyrotinib. Further phenotyping experiment proved that CYP3A4 was the most active enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of pyrotinib, implying the vital necessity of the assessment of the potential CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions in humans. Taken together, this study provided valuable metabolic data to explicate the dynamic process of pyrotinib in humans, and important reference basis for its safety evaluation and rational clinical application. The results will also benefit the assessment of the contributions to the overall activity or toxicity from the key metabolites.",

To examine molecular mechanism of RHS6 for Th2 cytokine expression, we used DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation. Deletion of RHS6 caused a dramatic resistance to allergic airway inflammation. RHS6 recruited transcription factors GATA3, SATB1, and IRF4, which play important roles in expression of all three Th2 cytokine genes.

Moreover, T-bet-dependent IFN\u03b3 expression in IFN\u03b3-producing memory Th2 cells appears to be controlled by the phosphorylation status of Gata3 in human and murine systems.

In this review, we present an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor \u03b22 and STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may also directly act on the Ifng gene.

However, it remains unclear whether the expression of other Th2-specific genes is induced directly by GATA3. A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to 1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells. Simultaneously, we identified 26 highly Th2-specific STAT6-dependent inducible genes by DNA microarray analysis-based three-step selection processes, and among them 17 genes showed GATA3 binding. We assessed dependency on GATA3 for the transcription of these 26 Th2-specific genes, and 10 genes showed increased transcription in a GATA3-dependent manner, whereas 16 genes showed no significant responses. The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.

This negative regulatory pathway was operative in human but not mouse CD4(+) T cells and was selective to type I IFN, as neither IFN-gamma nor IL-12 mediated such inhibition. IFN-alpha/beta blocked Th2 cytokine secretion through the inhibition of GATA3 during Th2 development and in fully committed Th2 cells.

Decreased activation of the ERK MAPK cascade upon TCR stimulation, but normal intracellular-free calcium ion concentration mobilization and normal IL-4-induced STAT6 activation were observed in aging mouse CD4(+) T cells. In addition, reduced expression of GATA3 was detected in developing Th2 cells. Chromatin remodeling of the Th2 cytokine gene locus was found to be impaired. Th2-dependent allergic airway inflammation was milder in aging mice compared with in young adult mice. These results suggest that the levels of Th2 cell differentiation and resulting Th2-dependent immune responses, including allergic airway inflammation, decline during aging through defects in the activation of the ERK MAPK cascade, expression of GATA3 protein and GATA3-dependent chromatin remodeling of the Th2 cytokine gene locus. In the present study, we provide the first evidence indicating that a chromatin-remodeling event in T cells is impaired by aging.",

In this study, we examined the functional role of the Runx1 transcription factor in Th cell differentiation. Naive T cells from transgenic mice expressing a dominant interfering form of Runx1 exhibited enhanced interleukin 4 production and efficient Th2 differentiation. In contrast, transduction of Runx1 into wild-type T cells caused a complete attenuation of Th2 differentiation and was accompanied by the cessation of GATA3 expression. Furthermore, endogenous expression of Runx1 in naive T cells declined after T cell receptor stimulation, at the same time that expression of GATA3 increased. We conclude that Runx1 plays a novel role as a negative regulator of GATA3 expression, thereby inhibiting the Th2 cell differentiation.",

Mice that lack the p50 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) are unable to mount airway eosinophilic inflammation. We show here that this is not due to defects in TH2 cell recruitment but due to the inability of the p50-/- mice to produce interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13: cytokines that play distinct roles in asthma pathogenesis. CD4+ T cells from p50-/- mice failed to induce Gata3 expression under TH2-differentiating conditions but showed unimpaired T-bet expression and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production under TH1-differentiating conditions. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity prevented GATA-3 expression and TH2 cytokine production in developing, but not committed, TH2 cells. Our studies provide a molecular basis for the need for both T cell receptor and cytokine signaling for GATA-3 expression and, in turn, TH2 differentiation.",

It has now been shown that adhesion molecules, particularly those of the immunoglobulin super family (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and PECAM-1), not only act as ligands for leucocyte receptors but can also serve as signal transducers. Engagement of these receptors initiates endothelial signalling cascades that result in downstream effector mechanisms which in turn influence the progression of neuroinflammation. In particular, it has been shown that ICAM-1-mediated signalling in brain endothelial cells is a crucial regulatory step in the process of lymphocyte migration through the blood-brain barrier and as such represents an additional phase in the multistep paradigm of leucocyte recruitment.

Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3, also known as CD50), a human leukocyte-restricted immunoglobulin super-family (IgSF) member, has previously been implicated in apoptotic cell clearance, although its precise role in the clearance process is ill defined. The main objective of this work is to further characterise the function of ICAM-3 in the removal of apoptotic cells. Using a range of novel anti-ICAM-3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including one (MA4) that blocks apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages, alongside apoptotic human leukocytes that are normal or deficient for ICAM-3, we demonstrate that ICAM-3 promotes a domain 1-2-dependent tethering interaction with phagocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate an apoptosis-associated reduction in ICAM-3 that results from release of ICAM-3 within microparticles that potently attract macrophages to apoptotic cells. Taken together, these data suggest that apoptotic cell-derived microparticles bearing ICAM-3 promote macrophage chemoattraction to sites of leukocyte cell death and that ICAM-3 mediates subsequent cell corpse tethering to macrophages. The defined function of ICAM-3 in these processes and profound defect in chemotaxis noted to ICAM-3-deficient microparticles suggest that ICAM-3 may be an important adhesion molecule involved in chemotaxis to apoptotic human leukocytes.",

These molecules represent important markers of endothelial inflammation. The present study was designed to investigate, with immunochemical and immunohistochemical techniques, the effect of treatment with (+/-)-alpha lipoic (thioctic) acid and its enantiomers on heart and kidney endothelium in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Arterial hypertension is accompanied by an increased oxidative stress status in the heart characterized by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nucleic acid oxidation increase. The higher oxidative stress also modifies adhesion molecules expression. In the heart VCAM-1, which was higher than ICAM-1 and PECAM-1, was increased in SHR. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression was significantly greater in the renal endothelium of SHR. (+/-)-Alpha lipoic acid and (+)-alpha lipoic acid treatment significantly decreased TBARS levels, the nucleic acid oxidation and prevented adhesion molecules expression in cardiac and renal vascular endothelium. These data suggest that endothelial molecules may be used for studying the mechanisms of vascular injury on target organs of hypertension. The effects observed after treatment with (+)-alpha lipoic acid could open new perspectives for countering heart and kidney microvascular injury which represent a common feature in hypertensive end-organs damage.",

There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. The integrin family has eight subfamilies, designated as beta 1 through beta 8. The most widely studied subfamilies are beta 1 (CD29, very late activation [VLA] members), beta 2 (leukocyte integrins such as CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, CD11c/CD18, and alpha d beta 2), beta 3 (CD61, cytoadhesions), and beta 7 (alpha 4 beta 7 and alpha E beta 7). The immunoglobulin superfamily includes leukocyte function antigen-2 (LFA-2 or CD2), leukocyte function antigen-3 (LFA-3 or CD58), intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PE-CAM-1), and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1). The selectin family includes E-selectin (CD62E), P-selectin (CD62P), and L-selectin (CD62L). Cadherins are major cell-cell adhesion molecules and include epithelial (E), placental (P), and neural (N) subclasses. The binding sites (ligands/receptors) are different for each of these cell adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM binds to CD11/CD18; VCAM-1 binds to VLA-4).

LFA-1 is an integrin expressed on leukocytes and is of critical importance in adhesion reactions, like antigen-specific responses, homing, and diapedesis. The main ligand binding site of LFA-1 is the I-domain, which recognizes intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. From experimental crystal structures, a large-scale conformational change of, among others, the alpha7 helix of the I-domain has been observed leading to the proposal that these structural changes are linked to the conformational regulation of LFA-1. The results from the present calculations show that structural changes of the alpha7 helix consistent with those observed in the crystal structures are significantly sampled by the low frequency modes. This was found to be particularly true for the low affinity state of the I-domain, indicating that low frequency motions favor the conformational transition implicated in activation. However, beyond the simple downward shift of the helix implied by the crystal structures, the calculations further show that there is a noticeable swinging-out motion of the helix. The consequences of this motion are discussed in the context of integrin activation and inhibition. Moreover, significant changes in the atomic-level dynamics and in long-range correlated motions of the I-domain were found to occur upon binding of the natural ligand ICAM. These changes were more local upon binding of an allosteric inhibitor. The present study opens the question of how changes in dynamics may contribute to the long-range transmission of signal upon ICAM binding by the LFA-1 I-domain.",

Expression of these integrins is a marker of poor prognosis in patients and can confer invasive (alpha v beta 3) and metastatic (VLA-4) properties to human melanoma cells injected into nude mice. Expression of the immunoglobulin superfamily molecules MUC18/MCAM and ICAM-1 are associated with primary tumors and metastases.

Expression of ICAM-1 has been shown to be a marker of poor prognosis in stage I tumors and interfering with its expression inhibits experimental metastasis by melanomas in nude mice. E-cadherin is used by epidermal melanocytes to interact with neighboring keratinocytes. Changes in E-cadherin expression and cellular localization is first observed in the radial growth phase, the earliest stage in melanoma development. Loss of E-cadherin function is associated with upregulation or induction of MUC18/MCAM and alpha v beta 3 in melanocytic cells in vitro and with alterations in the levels and cellular distribution of the transcriptional regulator beta-catenin in melanomas in vivo.

In this study, a sp\u00e4tzle gene of freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MrSpz) was isolated and characterized. The open reading frame of MrSpz consisted of 747 nucleotides encoding 248 amino acid residues containing a signal peptide and C-terminal sp\u00e4tzle activated domain. MrSpz shared high similarity to sp\u00e4tzle of Fenneropenaeus chinensis (FcSpz) at 92% identity and Marsupenaeus japonicus (MjSpz) at 83% identity. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and the results revealed that MrSpz was a member of the clade containing LvSpz3 of Litopenaeus vannamei, FcSpz and Penaeus monodon sp\u00e4tzle protein. The expression distribution at transcriptional level in various tissues of normal prawn revealed that the MrSpz was detected in gills, heart and hepatopancreas while no expression was observed in hemocyte, muscle and stomach. In the Aeromonas caviae challenged prawn, the expression level of MrSpz in hemocyte was increased gradually at 6, 12 and 24 h post-injection. Furthermore, in MrSpz knocked down prawn injected with Aeromonas caviae, the mortality rate were higher than that of non-related dsRNA group and control group. These results suggest that MrSpz protein may play a key role in the innate immunity of M. rosenbergii, especially in response to Gram-negative bacteria A. caviae invasion.",

Here, we conducted <i>in vitro</i> assays in the <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cell line with the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domains of each Toll family member to determine whether they can activate a known target of Toll-1, the promoter of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin. All TIR family members activated the drosomycin promoter, with Toll-1 and Toll-7 TIRs producing the highest activation. We found that the Toll-1 and Toll-7 ectodomains bind Spz-1, -2, and -5, and also vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virions, and that Spz-1, -2, -5, and VSV all activated the promoters of drosomycin and several other AMP genes in S2 cells expressing full-length Toll-1 or Toll-7. <i>In vivo</i> experiments indicated that Toll-1 and Toll-7 mutants could be systemically infected with two bacterial species (<i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>), the opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i>, and VSV with different survival times in adult females and males compared with WT fly survival. Our results suggest that all Toll family members can activate several AMP genes. Our results further indicate that Toll-1 and Toll-7 bind multiple Spz proteins and also VSV, but they differentially affect adult survival after systemic infection, potentially because of sex-specific differences in Toll-1 and Toll-7 expression.",

To date few comparative studies have been carried out to investigate the difference of genome editing characteristics between CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs. While the CRISPR/Cas9 system has overtaken TALENs as the tool of choice for most research groups working in this field, we hypothesized that there could be certain applications whereby the application of TALENs would have specific benefits. Here we compare CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN as tools for introducing site-specific editing events at an integrated EGFP gene in the genome of HEK293FT cells. Guide RNAs and TALEN pairs were designed to target two loci within the EGFP gene. We found that paired Cas9 nucleases induced targeted genomic deletion more efficiently and precisely than two TALEN pairs. However, when concurrently supplied with a plasmid template spanning the two DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within EGFP, TALENs stimulated homology directed repair (HDR) more efficiently than CRISPR/Cas9 and caused fewer targeted genomic deletions. Our data suggest that the choice of genome editing tool should be determined by the desired genome editing outcome.

PTEN has phosphatase-dependent and phosphatase-independent (scaffold) activities in the cell and governs a variety of biological processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival, migration, proliferation and metabolism. Even a subtle decrease in PTEN levels and activity results in cancer susceptibility and favours tumour progression. Regulation of PTEN has therefore emerged as a subject of intense research in tumour biology. Recent discoveries, including the existence of distinct PTEN isoforms and the ability of PTEN to form dimers, have brought to light new modes of PTEN function and regulation. These milestone findings have in turn opened new therapeutic avenues for cancer prevention and treatment through restoration of PTEN tumour suppressor activity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29460925": "Genomic aberrations of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene are among the most common in prostate cancer. Inactivation of PTEN by deletion or mutation is identified in \u223c20% of primary prostate tumour samples at radical prostatectomy and in as many as 50% of castration-resistant tumours. Loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) function leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT (phosphoinositide 3-kinase-RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase) pathway and is strongly associated with adverse oncological outcomes, making PTEN a potentially useful genomic marker to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease in patients with clinically localized tumours. At the other end of the disease spectrum, therapeutic compounds targeting nodes in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signalling pathway are being tested in clinical trials for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Knowledge of PTEN status might be helpful to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from these therapies. To enable the use of PTEN status as a prognostic and predictive biomarker, analytically validated assays have been developed for reliable and reproducible detection of PTEN loss in tumour tissue and in blood liquid biopsies. The use of clinical-grade assays in tumour tissue has shown a robust correlation between loss of PTEN and its protein as well as a strong association between PTEN loss and adverse pathological features and oncological outcomes. In advanced disease, assessing PTEN status in liquid biopsies shows promise in predicting response to targeted therapy. Finally, studies have shown that PTEN might have additional functions that are independent of the PI3K-AKT pathway, including those affecting tumour growth through modulation of the immune response and tumour microenvironment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25894966": "Developmental progress of germ cells through meiotic phases is closely tied to ongoing meiotic recombination. In mammals, recombination preferentially occurs in genomic regions known as hotspots; the protein that activates these hotspots is PRDM9, containing a genetically variable zinc finger (ZNF) domain and a PR-SET domain with histone H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity. PRDM9 is required for fertility in mice, but little is known about its localization and developmental dynamics. Application of spermatogenic stage-specific markers demonstrates that PRDM9 accumulates in male germ cell nuclei at pre-leptonema to early leptonema but is no longer detectable in nuclei by late zygonema. By the pachytene stage, PRDM9-dependent histone H3K4 trimethyl marks on hotspots also disappear. PRDM9 localizes to nuclei concurrently with the deposition of meiotic cohesin complexes, but is not required for incorporation of cohesin complex proteins into chromosomal axial elements, or accumulation of normal numbers of RAD51 foci on meiotic chromatin by late zygonema. Germ cells lacking PRDM9 exhibit inefficient homology recognition and synapsis, with aberrant repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks and transcriptional abnormalities characteristic of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin. Together, these results on the developmental time course for nuclear localization of PRDM9 establish its direct window of function and demonstrate the independence of chromosome axial element formation from the concurrent PRDM9-mediated activation of recombination hotspots.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604780": "In mammals, genetic recombination during meiosis is limited to a set of 1- to 2-kb regions termed hotspots. Their locations are predominantly determined by the zinc finger protein PRDM9, which binds to DNA in hotspots and subsequently uses its SET domain to locally trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). This sets the stage for double-strand break (DSB) formation and reciprocal exchange of DNA between chromatids, forming Holliday junctions. Here we report genome-wide analyses of PRDM9-dependent histone modifications using two inbred mouse strains differing only in their PRDM9 zinc finger domain. We show that PRDM9 binding actively reorganizes nucleosomes into a symmetrical pattern, creating an extended nucleosome-depleted region. These regions are centered by a consensus PRDM9 binding motif, whose location and identity was confirmed in vitro. We also show that DSBs are centered over the PRDM9 binding motif within the nucleosome-depleted region. Combining these results with data from genetic crosses, we find that crossing-over is restricted to the region marked by H3K4me3. We suggest that PRDM9-modified nucleosomes create a permissible environment that first directs the location of DSBs and then defines the boundaries of Holliday junction branch migration.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23618393": " Meiotic recombination ensures proper segregation of homologous chromosomes and creates genetic variation. In many organisms, recombination occurs at limited sites, termed 'hotspots', whose positions in mammals are determined by PR domain member 9 (PRDM9), a long-array zinc-finger and chromatin-modifier protein. Determining the rules governing the DNA binding of PRDM9 is a major issue in understanding how it functions. Mouse PRDM9 protein variants bind to hotspot DNA sequences in a manner that is specific for both PRDM9 and DNA haplotypes, and that in vitro binding parallels its in vivo biological activity. Examining four hotspots, three activated by Prdm9Cst and one activated by Prdm9Dom2, we found that all binding sites required the full array of 11 or 12 contiguous fingers, depending on the allele, and that there was little sequence similarity between the binding sites of the three Prdm9Cst activated hotspots. The binding specificity of each position in the Hlx1 binding site, activated by Prdm9Cst, was tested by mutating each nucleotide to its three alternatives. The 31 positions along the binding site varied considerably in the ability of alternative bases to support binding, which also implicates a role for additional binding to the DNA phosphate backbone. These results, which provide the first detailed mapping of PRDM9 binding to DNA and, to our knowledge, the most detailed analysis yet of DNA binding by a long zinc-finger array, make clear that the binding specificities of PRDM9, and possibly other long-array zinc-finger proteins, are unusually complex.",

First, two mouse strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second, the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots; this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro studies. Third, allelic variants of PRDM9 zinc fingers are significantly associated with variability in genome-wide hotspot usage among humans. Our results provide a molecular basis for the distribution of meiotic recombination in mammals, in which the binding of PRDM9 to specific DNA sequences targets the initiation of recombination at specific locations in the genome.",

Many properties of this protein remain mysterious, however, including how it binds to DNA, how it contributes to male infertility-both in humans, and in hybrid mice-and why, in spite of its fundamental function in meiosis, its binding domain varies extensively among humans and across mammals. We present a brief summary of what has recently been learned about PRDM9 in different fields, focusing on the puzzles yet to be resolved.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27362481": "In many mammals, including humans and mice, the zinc finger histone methyltransferase PRDM9 performs the first step in meiotic recombination by specifying the locations of hotspots, the sites of genetic recombination. PRDM9 binds to DNA at hotspots through its zinc finger domain and activates recombination by trimethylating histone H3K4 on adjacent nucleosomes through its PR/SET domain. Recently, the isolated PR/SET domain of PRDM9 was shown capable of also trimethylating H3K36 in vitro, raising the question of whether this reaction occurs in vivo during meiosis, and if so, what its function might be. Here, we show that full-length PRDM9 does trimethylate H3K36 in vivo in mouse spermatocytes. Levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are highly correlated at hotspots, but mutually exclusive elsewhere. In vitro, we find that although PRDM9 trimethylates H3K36 much more slowly than it does H3K4, PRDM9 is capable of placing both marks on the same histone molecules. In accord with these results, we also show that PRDM9 can trimethylate both K4 and K36 on the same nucleosomes in vivo, but the ratio of K4me3/K36me3 is much higher for the pair of nucleosomes adjacent to the PRDM9 binding site compared to the next pair further away. Importantly, H3K4me3/H3K36me3-double-positive nucleosomes occur only in regions of recombination: hotspots and the pseudoautosomal (PAR) region of the sex chromosomes. These double-positive nucleosomes are dramatically reduced when PRDM9 is absent, showing that this signature is PRDM9-dependent at hotspots; the residual double-positive nucleosomes most likely come from the PRDM9-independent PAR. These results, together with the fact that PRDM9 is the only known mammalian histone methyltransferase with both H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation activity, suggest that trimethylation of H3K36 plays an important role in the recombination process. Given the known requirement of H3K36me3 for double strand break repair by homologous recombination in somatic cells, we suggest that it may play the same role in meiosis.",

The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs <i>in vitro</i> and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC<sub>50</sub>) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC<sub>50</sub> The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same <i>in vitro</i> resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group \u03b2-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV <i>in vitro</i> and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.",

To unravel BRAFi resistance mechanisms we have performed gene expression and mass spectrometry based proteome profiling of the sensitive parental A375 BRAF V600E-mutated human melanoma cell line and of daughter cell lines with induced BRAFi resistance. Increased expression of two novel resistance candidates, aminopeptidase-N (CD13/ANPEP) and ETS transcription factor FLI1 was observed in the BRAFi-resistant daughter cell lines. In addition, increased levels of the previously reported resistance mediators, receptor tyrosine kinase ephrine receptor A2 (EPHA2) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET were also identified. The expression of these proteins was assessed in matched tumor samples from melanoma patients obtained before BRAFi and after disease progression. MET was overexpressed in all progression samples while the expression of the other candidates varied between the individual patients. Targeting CD13/ANPEP by a blocking antibody induced apoptosis in both parental A375- and BRAFi-resistant daughter cells as well as in melanoma cells with intrinsic BRAFi resistance and led to dephosphorylation of EPHA2 on S897, previously demonstrated to cause inhibition of the migratory capacity. AKT and RSK, both reported to induce EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation, were also dephosphorylated after inhibition of CD13/ANPEP. FLI1 silencing also caused decreases in EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation and in total MET protein expression. In addition, silencing of FLI1 sensitized the resistant cells to BRAFi. Furthermore, we show that BRAFi in combination with the multi kinase inhibitor dasatinib can abrogate BRAFi resistance and decrease both EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation and total FLI1 protein expression. This is the first report presenting CD13/ANPEP and FLI1 as important mediators of resistance to BRAF inhibition with potential as drug targets in BRAFi refractory melanoma.",

Here we found that EPHA2 is overexpressed in EGFR TKI-resistant tumor cells. Loss of EPHA2 reduced the viability of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells harboring EGFR(T790M) mutations in vitro and inhibited tumor growth and progression in an inducible EGFR(L858R+T790M)-mutant lung cancer model in vivo. Targeting EPHA2 in erlotinib-resistant cells decreased S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of cell death agonist BAD, resulting in reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 by the small-molecule inhibitor ALW-II-41-27 decreased both survival and proliferation of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. ALW-II-41-27 was also effective in decreasing viability of cells with acquired resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI AZD9291.

The possibility that the Igf2r and Air promoters share the same cis-acting regulatory elements, albeit on opposite parental chromosomes, was supported by the similar expression profiles of Igf2r and Air in vivo. These results refine our understanding of the onset of imprinted silencing at this cluster and indicate the Air noncoding RNA may specifically target silencing to the Igf2r promoter.",

The Air ncRNA is imprinted--monoallelically expressed from the paternal allele. Air is required for allele-specific silencing of the cis-linked Slc22a3, Slc22a2, and Igf2r genes in mouse placenta. We show that Air interacts with the Slc22a3 promoter chromatin and the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a in placenta. Air accumulates at the Slc22a3 promoter in correlation with localized H3K9 methylation and transcriptional repression. Genetic ablation of G9a results in nonimprinted, biallelic transcription of Slc22a3. Truncated Air fails to accumulate at the Slc22a3 promoter, which results in reduced G9a recruitment and biallelic transcription. Our results suggest that Air, and potentially other large ncRNAs, target repressive histone-modifying activities through molecular interaction with specific chromatin domains to epigenetically silence transcription.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25918552": " Appropriate epigenetic regulation of gene expression during lineage allocation and tissue differentiation is required for normal development. One example is genomic imprinting, which is defined as parent-of-origin mono-allelic gene expression. Imprinting is established largely due to epigenetic differences arriving in the zygote from sperm and egg haploid genomes. In the mouse, there are approximately 150 known imprinted genes, many of which occur in imprinted gene clusters that are regulated together. One imprinted cluster includes the maternally expressed Igf2r, Slc22a2, and Slc22a3 genes and the paternally expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Airn. Although it is known that Igf2r and Airn are reciprocally imprinted, the timing of imprinted expression and accompanying epigenetic changes have not been well characterized in vivo. Here we show lineage- and temporal-specific regulation of DNA methylation and histone modifications at the Igf2r/Airn locus correlating with differential establishment of imprinted expression during gastrulation. Our results show that Igf2r is expressed from both alleles in the E6.5 epiblast. After gastrulation commences, the locus becomes imprinted in the embryonic lineage with the lncRNA Airn expressed from the paternal allele and Igf2r restricted to maternal allele expression. We document differentially enriched allele-specific histone modifications in extraembryonic and embryonic tissues. We also document for the first time allele-specific spreading of DNA methylation during gastrulation concurrent with establishment of imprinted expression of Igf2r. Importantly, we show that imprinted expression does not change in the extraembryonic lineage even though maternal DMR2 methylation spreading does occur, suggesting distinct mechanisms at play in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. These results indicate that similar to preimplantation, gastrulation represents a window of dynamic lineage-specific epigenetic regulation in vivo.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268152": " Genomic imprinting leads to maternal expression of IGF2R in both mouse and opossum. In mouse, the antisense long noncoding (lnc) RNA Airn, which is paternally expressed from the differentially methylated region (DMR) in the second intron of Igf2r, is required to silence the paternal Igf2r. In opossum, however, intriguingly, the DMR was reported to be in a different downstream intron (intron 11) and there was no antisense lncRNA detected in previous analyses. Therefore, clarifying the imprinting mechanism of marsupial IGF2R is of great relevance for understanding the origin and evolution of genomic imprinting in the IGF2R locus. Thus, the antisense lncRNA associated with the marsupial DMR can be considered as the 'missing link'. In this study, we identified a novel antisense lncRNA, ALID, after detailed analysis of the IGF2R locus in an Australian marsupial, the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, and compared it to that of the grey short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica. Tammar IGF2R showed maternal expression and had a maternally methylated CpG island (CGI) in intron 12 as well as a promoter CGI without differential methylation, but none in the second intron. Re-analysis of the IGF2R of opossum detected the CGI in intron 12, not intron 11, as previously reported, confirming that the DMR in intron 12 is conserved between these marsupials and so is the putative imprinting control region of marsupial IGF2R. ALID is paternally expressed from the middle of the DMR and is approximately 650 bp long with a single exon structure that is extremely short compared to Airn. Hence, the lncRNA transcriptional overlap of the IGF2R promoter, which is essential for the Igf2r silencing in the mouse, is likely absent in tammar. This suggests that fundamental differences in the lncRNA-based silencing mechanisms evolved in eutherian and marsupial IGF2R and may reflect the lack of differential methylation in the promoter CGI of marsupial IGF2R. Our study thus provides the best candidate factor for establishing paternal silencing of marsupial IGF2R without transcriptional overlap, which is distinct from the Igf2r silencing mechanism of Airn, but which may be analogous to the mode of action for the flanking Slc22a2 and Slc22a3 gene silencing in the mouse placenta.",

The largely neuronal 14-3-3 proteins are also elevated in the central nervous system (CNS) and cerebrospinal fluid of Tauopathy patients, suggesting functional linkage. We use the simplicity and genetic facility of the Drosophila system to investigate in vivo whether 14-3-3s are causal or synergistic with Tau accumulation in precipitating pathogenesis. Proteomic, biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrate that both Drosophila 14-3-3 proteins interact with human wild-type and mutant Tau on multiple sites irrespective of their phosphorylation state. 14-3-3 dimers regulate steady-state phosphorylation of both wild-type and the R406W mutant Tau, but they are not essential for toxicity of either variant. Moreover, 14-3-3 elevation itself is not pathogenic, but recruitment of dimers on accumulating wild-type Tau increases its steady-state levels ostensibly by occluding access to proteases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In contrast, the R406W mutant, which lacks a putative 14-3-3 binding site, responds differentially to elevation of each 14-3-3 isoform. Although excess 14-3-3\u03b6 stabilizes the mutant protein, elevated D14-3-3\u025b has a destabilizing effect probably because of altered 14-3-3 dimer composition. Our collective data demonstrate the complexity of 14-3-3/Tau interactions in vivo and suggest that 14-3-3 attenuation is not appropriate ameliorative treatment of Tauopathies. Finally, we suggest that 'bystander' 14-3-3s are recruited by accumulating Tau with the consequences depending on the composition of available dimers within particular neurons and the Tau variant.",

Differences in the phenotypes of Btk-/- and lyn-/- mice suggest that these kinases may also have independent or opposing functions. B cell development and function were examined in Btk-/-lyn-/- mice to better understand the functional interaction of Btk and Lyn in vivo. The antigen-independent phase of B lymphopoiesis was normal in Btk-/-lyn-/- mice. However, Btk-/-lyn-/- animals had a more severe immunodeficiency than Btk-/- mice. B cell numbers and response to T cell-dependent antigens were reduced. Btk and Lyn therefore play independent or partially redundant roles in the maintenance and function of peripheral B cells. Autoimmunity, hypersensitivity to B cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking, and splenomegaly caused by myeloerythroid hyperplasia were alleviated by Btk deficiency in lyn-/- mice. A transgene expressing Btk at approximately 25% of endogenous levels (Btklo) was crossed onto Btk-/- and Btk-/-lyn-/- backgrounds to demonstrate that Btk is limiting for BCR signaling in the presence but not in the absence of Lyn. These observations indicate that the net outcome of Lyn function in vivo is to inhibit Btk-dependent pathways in B and myeloid cells, and that Btklo mice are a useful sensitized system to identify regulatory components of Btk signaling pathways.",

The autoantibody production in PIR-B-deficient (Pirb(-/-)) mice was further augmented in combination with the Fas(lpr) mutation, which might be linked to the development of autoimmune glomerulonephritis. These results show the critical link between TLR9-mediated sensing and a simultaneously evoked, PIR-B-mediated inhibitory circuit with a Btk intersection in B-1 cells, and suggest a novel way toward preventing pathogenic natural autoantibody production.",

Here, we show that transgenic mice overexpressing Btk specifically in B cells spontaneously formed germinal centers and manifested increased plasma cell numbers, leading to antinuclear autoantibody production and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like autoimmune pathology affecting kidneys, lungs, and salivary glands. Autoimmunity was fully dependent on Btk kinase activity, because Btk inhibitor treatment (PCI-32765) could normalize B-cell activation and differentiation, and because autoantibodies were absent in Btk transgenic mice overexpressing a kinase inactive Btk mutant. B cells overexpressing wild-type Btk were selectively hyperresponsive to BCR stimulation and showed enhanced Ca(2+) influx, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation, resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis, and defective elimination of selfreactive B cells in vivo. These findings unravel a crucial role for Btk in setting the threshold for B-cell activation and counterselection of autoreactive B cells, making Btk an attractive therapeutic target in systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE. The finding of in vivo pathology associated with Btk overexpression may have important implications for the development of gene therapy strategies for X-linked agammaglobulinemia, the immunodeficiency associated with mutations in BTK.",

Recently, selective inhibition of Btk by PCI-32765 has shown promise in limiting activity of multiple cells types in various models of cancer and autoimmunity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Btk inhibition by PCI-32765 on the development of lupus in lupus-prone B6.Sle1 and B6.Sle1.Sle3 mice. B6.Sle1 or B6.Sle1.Sle3 mice received drinking water containing either the Btk inhibitor PCI-32765 or vehicle for 56 days. Following treatment, mice were examined for clinical and pathological characteristics of lupus. The effect of PCI-32765 on specific cell types was also investigated. In this study, we report that Btk inhibition dampens humoral autoimmunity in B6.Sle1 monocongenic mice. Moreover, in B6.Sle1.Sle3 bicongenic mice that are prone to severe lupus, Btk inhibition also dampens humoral and cellular autoimmunity, as well as lupus nephritis.

Over the last few years, considerable efforts have been made in order to develop small-molecule inhibitors for these kinases to treat lymphocyte malignancies, autoimmunity or allergy/hypersensitivity. The rationale is that even if complete lack of BTK or ITK during development causes severe immunodeficiency, inactivation after birth may result in a less severe phenotype. Moreover, therapy can be transient or only partially block the activity of BTK or ITK. Furthermore, a drug-induced B cell deficiency is treatable by gamma globulin substitution therapy. The newly developed BTK inhibitor PCI-32765, recently renamed Ibrutinib, has already entered several clinical trials for various forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as for multiple myeloma. Experimental animal studies have demonstrated highly promising treatment effects also in autoimmunity. ITK inhibitors are still under the early developmental phase, but it can be expected that such drugs will also become very useful.

The Ets1 transcription factor acts in B cells to prevent PC differentiation. Ets1(-/-) mice accumulate PCs and produce autoantibodies. Ets1 expression is downregulated upon B cell activation through the BCR and TLRs and is maintained by the inhibitory signaling pathway mediated by Lyn, CD22 and SiglecG, and SHP-1. In the absence of these inhibitory components, Ets1 levels are reduced in B cells in a Btk-dependent manner. This leads to increased PCs, autoantibodies, and an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of Ets1(-/-) mice. Defects in inhibitory signaling molecules, including Lyn and Ets1, are associated with human lupus, although the effects are more subtle than the complete deficiency that occurs in knockout mice. In this study, we explore the effect of partial disruption of the Lyn/Ets1 pathway on B cell tolerance and find that Lyn(+/-)Ets1(+/-) mice demonstrate greater and earlier production of IgM, but not IgG, autoantibodies compared with Lyn(+/-) or Ets1(+/-) mice. We also show that Btk-dependent downregulation of Ets1 is important for normal PC homeostasis when inhibitory signaling is intact. Ets1 deficiency restores the decrease in steady state PCs and Ab levels observed in Btk(-/-) mice. Thus, depending on the balance of activating and inhibitory signals to Ets1, there is a continuum of effects on autoantibody production and PC maintenance. This ranges from full-blown autoimmunity with complete loss of Ets1-maintaining signals to reduced PC and Ab levels with impaired Ets1 downregulation.",

In particular, we highlight BTK function in B cells in the context of host defense and autoimmunity. Small-molecule inhibitors of BTK have very recently shown impressive anti-tumor activity in clinical studies in patients with various B cell malignancies.

BTK was initially identified by positional cloning of the gene causing X-linked agammaglobulinemia and independently in a search for new kinases. Given the phenotype of affected patients, namely lack of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells with the ensuing inability to mount humoral immune responses, BTK inhibitors were anticipated to have beneficial effects on antibody-mediated pathologies, such as autoimmunity. In contrast to, for example, the SRC-family of cytoplasmic kinases, there was no obvious way in which structural alterations would yield constitutively active forms of BTK, and such mutations were also not found in leukemias or lymphomas. In 2007, the first efficient inhibitor, ibrutinib, was reported and soon became approved both in the United States and in Europe for the treatment of three B-cell malignancies, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia. Over the past few years, additional inhibitors have been developed, with acalabrutinib being more selective, and recently demonstrating fewer clinical adverse effects. The antitumor mechanism is also not related to mutations in BTK. Instead tumor residency in lymphoid organs is inhibited, making these drugs highly versatile. BTK is one of the only 10 human kinases that carry a cysteine in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cleft. As this allows for covalent, irreversible inhibitor binding, it provides these compounds with a highly advantageous character. This quality may be crucial and bodes well for the future of BTK-modifying medicines, which have been estimated to reach annual multi-billion dollar sales in the future.",

Andexanet alfa (Andexxa, Portola Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA) is a modified form of factor Xa that acts as a decoy binding entity for DOACs, thereby allowing endogenous factor Xa to perform its normal clotting functions. Andexanet has proven efficacious in clinical trials for reversing the anticoagulant effects of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, although its impact on clinical outcomes has not been adequately studied.

Because the duration of the DOACs is much less than that of warfarin, it is unclear how many patients would actually need andexanet in clinical practice, because cessation of the DOAC may be all that is needed to effectively manage bleeding.

Methylation of cytosine (5mC) at CG dinucleotides, traditionally associated with transcriptional repression, is the most highly studied chemical modification of DNA, occurring at over 70% of all CG dinucleotides in the genome. Hypomethylated regions (HMRs) often occur in CG islands (CGIs), however, they also occur outside of CGIs and function as cell-type specific enhancers. During the process of differentiation, reorganization of chromatin and nucleosome arrangement at regulatory regions is thought to occur in order for the establishment of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. However, the specifics regarding the organization of nucleosomes at HMRs and the potential mechanisms regulating nucleosome occupancy in these regions are unknown. Here, we have investigated nucleosome organization around hypomethylated regions (HMRs) identified in two mouse primary cells. Microccocal nuclease (MNase) digested mononucleosomes from primary cultures of new-born female mouse dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were mapped and compared to the HMRs obtained from single base-pair resolution methylomes. In both cell types, we find that nucleosomes are enriched at HMR boundaries. In contrast to the nucleosomes found at boundaries of HMRs in CGIs, HMRs outside of CGIs are calculated to be preferentially bound by nucleosomes, with phased nucleosomes propagating into the methylated region. Nucleosomes are enriched at the tissue-specific HMRs (TS-HMR) boundaries in both cell types suggesting that nucleosome organization surrounding HMR boundaries is independent of methylation status. In addition, we find potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites (E-box motifs) enriched in non-CGI TS-HMR boundaries. Our results show that intrinsic nucleosome occupancy score (INOS) positively correlate with the nucleosome organization surrounding non-CGI TS-HMRs, suggesting that DNA sequence plays a role in the establishment of HMRs in the genome.

In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Outside CpG islands, binding of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5mC to 5hmC, is associated with labile, MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. Such nucleosomes are poised for eviction in ESCs and become stably bound in differentiated cells where the TET1 and 5hmC levels go down. This process regulates a class of CTCF binding sites outside CpG islands that are occupied by CTCF in ESCs but lose the protein during differentiation. We rationalize this cell type-dependent targeting of CTCF with a quantitative biophysical model of competitive binding with the histone octamer, depending on the TET1, 5hmC, and 5mC state.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25263161": " Hydroxymethylation of DNA at the C5 position of cytosine (5hmC) is recognized as an important epigenetic mark. The molecular role of 5hmC in gene regulation, however, is not well understood. We studied the effects of 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC) on nucleosome properties in vitro using a combination of biochemical and fluorescence assays. Competitive reconstitution was used to evaluate the effect of 5hmC on nucleosome formation. The effects of 5hmC on nucleosome compactness and stability were characterized using FRET assays. These findings have also been compared with another important epigenetic mark, the cytosine methylation (5mC) of DNA. We observed that hydroxymethylation increases the binding affinity of DNA for the histone octamer. The formed nucleosome exhibits slightly different conformations based on the sequence and epigenetic context of DNA. DNA hydroxymethylation decreases the stability of formed nucleosomes in salt-induced dissociation processes. DNA containing 5hmC is more likely to be incorporated into nucleosomes. Once formed, the 5hmC nucleosomes might be in an open and transcriptionally active state due to the weakened interaction of hydroxymethylated DNA with the H2A-H2B dimers. Our results reveal the effect of 5hmC on regulating nucleosome compactness and stability in vitro.",

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company's submission (CS), the ERG report and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the appraisal committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T based upon the CS. In the CS, pooled evidence of two trials (a phase II trial and RECOURSE) showed that T/T resulted in a significant increase in overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78] and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.53). The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a344,032 per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of \u00a352,695 and \u00a349,392 per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively. Since the AC concluded that the most plausible ICER was \u00a349,392 per QALY gained, and that T/T meets end-of-life criteria, T/T was recommended as a cost effective use of NHS resources.",

TAS-102 (FTD/TPI) is a new oral anti-tumour agent composed of a nucleoside analogue, trifluridine, and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil, indicated for patients with mCRC who are refractory to standard therapies. This study summarizes published and unpublished experience with FTD/TPI in clinical practice settings. <b>Patients and methods:</b> The Medline/PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify observational studies on FTD/TPI monotherapy for mCRC. Papers describing use of FTD/TPI monotherapy outside clinical trials in series of patients evaluable for effectiveness were eligible. The outcomes of interest were median progression free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS) as well as mean PFS time restricted to six months (PFS<sub>6m</sub>) and mean OS time restricted to one year (OS<sub>1y</sub>). Results of the pooled analyses of observational studies were compared to the results of the Japanese phase II trial and the two phase III trials, RECOURSE and TERRA. <b>Results:</b> Seven published and two unpublished studies with 1008 patients from 64 centres were included for analysis. The pooled mPFS was 2.2 months (95% CI 2.1 to 2.3 months), and the pooled mOS was 6.6 months (95% CI 6.1 to 7.1 months). PFS<sub>6m</sub> was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.6 to 3.1 months) and OS<sub>1y</sub> was 6.8 (95% CI 6.0 to 7.5) months. While these results all reflect RECOURSE, the pooled mOS is lower than in the phase II trial and the OS<sub>1y</sub> is inferior to both the phase II trial and TERRA. <b>Conclusion:</b> This systematic review and a meta-analysis indicates that in real life settings, the survival benefit of FTD/TPI monotherapy in patients with therapy refractory mCRC reflects the outcomes in RECOURSE but is inferior to outcomes in the two Asian efficacy trials.

Testing is now being used to empower consumers and can be used 'to shed new light on your distant ancestors, your close family and most of all, yourself' (23andMe).

Here, we evaluate the clinical relevance of pharmacogenetic tests reported by 23andMe in their UK tests. The research papers listed under each 23andMe report were evaluated, extracting information on effect size, sample size and ethnicity. A wider literature search was performed to provide a fuller assessment of the pharmacogenetic test and variants were matched to FDA recommendations. Additional evidence from CPIC guidelines, PharmGKB, and Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group was reviewed to determine current clinical practice. The value of the tests across ethnic groups was determined, including information on linkage disequilibrium between the tested SNP and causal pharmacogenetic variant, where relevant. 23andMe offers 12 pharmacogenetic tests to their UK customers, some of which are in standard clinical practice, and others which are less widely applied. The clinical validity and clinical utility varies extensively between tests. The variants tested are likely to have different degrees of sensitivity due to different risk allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns across populations. The clinical relevance depends on the ethnicity of the individual and variability of pharmacogenetic markers. Further research is required to determine causal variants and provide more complete assessment of drug response and side effects. 23andMe reports provide some useful pharmacogenetics information, mirroring clinical tests that are in standard use. Other tests are unspecific, providing limited guidance and may not be useful for patients without professional interpretation.

Drawing on sociology on medical cosmologies, research on digital media and marketing and an analysis of the 23andMe online genetic testing platform, I identify three features of this cosmology. First, digital health seeks to foment 'flow' or enjoyable, continuous immersion in health. Second, digital health configures its consumers as 'co-creators' of health data and knowledge together with companies and other consumers. Third, digital health frames medical knowledge as tentative, up for revision and scepticism by expert and lay science. The way in which digital health configures consumers as immersed, creative and sceptical gives it an open-ended and participatory air.

In the 1970s, the FDA briefly denied women access to home pregnancy tests that were identical to those used in laboratories. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it relied on concerns about consumer responses to HIV status results to justify a categorical ban on applications for HIV home-testing technology. More recently, it placed burdensome restrictions on direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies, such as 23andMe, based on fears that consumers would make irrational medical decisions after receiving genetic variant results. Although the FDA has the statutory authority to ensure the \"safety and effectiveness\" of medical devices, it has expansively interpreted the term \"safety\" to encompass considerations of how consumers might use test results provided by purely informative devices. This Note argues that courts should not give the FDA deference on its broad interpretation of safety\" in restricting home-testing devices. It documents the evolution of the expertise-based rationale for judicial deference, noting that courts typically provide scientific agencies, including the FDA, \"super deference\" because of the complicated nature of their work. Ultimately, courts should not defer to the FDA's interpretation of \"safety\" because it did not use its scientific expertise when it considered how consumers might react to HIV home-testing and DTC genetic testing results.

In contrast, c.2403 G&gt;A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic HCV-infection (P &lt; 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant, c.1-120T&gt;G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7 variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P &lt; 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7 variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific effect of this X-chromosomal variation.",

The majority of corticotropic adenomas are monoclonal and occur sporadically. Only rarely does CD arise in the context of genetic familial syndromes. Targeted sequencing of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes commonly mutated in other tumours did not identify recurrent mutations. In contrast, next generation sequencing allowed us recently to clarify the genetic basis of CD: we identified somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) gene in a significant portion of corticotropinomas. These mutations represent a novel and unique mechanism leading to ACTH excess. Inhibition of USP8 or its downstream signalling pathways could represent a new therapeutic approach for the management of CD. In this review, we will focus on this new evidence and its implication for clinical care of affected patients.",

Most cases of Cushing's syndrome are due to increased adrenocorticotropic hormone production from a pituitary adenoma, which is referred to as Cushing's disease. Most of the signs and symptoms are nonspecific and common in the general population, making a diagnosis often challenging. However, several dermatological manifestations, such as fragile skin, easy bruising, and reddish purple striae, are more discriminatory. Because uncontrolled Cushing's syndrome of any etiology is associated with substantial morbidity, including increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, it is important to make an early diagnosis. Unfortunately, median delays of 2 years to diagnosis have been reported. We report a case of a woman who had multiple dermatological findings, including facial plethora, easy bruising, violaceous striae, hirsutism, and acne, the latter 2 signs reflecting androgen excess. Of interest, our patient presented with a chief complaint of hair loss, a common complaint in the general population that occurs with a greater frequency in patients with Cushing's disease and is attributed to androgenetic alopecia, but it is rarely the presenting symptom.",

Depression was found to have a negative correlation with self-esteem and positive correlation with body image disturbances. A high prevalence of psychopathology is seen in patients of CD which may often go undetected.

In Cushing's disease, mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) have been detected. These mutations are associated with hyperactivation of USP8 that prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation. This leads to increased EGFR stability and results in the maintenance of EGFR signaling in Cushing's disease. USP8 inhibitors can suppress the growth of various tumors. In this study, the effects of a potent USP8 inhibitor, DUBs-IN-2, on ACTH production and cell proliferation were examined in mouse corticotroph tumor (AtT-20) cells. Proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) mRNA levels and ACTH levels were decreased in AtT-20 cells by DUBs-IN-2. Further, cell proliferation was inhibited, and apoptosis was induced by DUBs-IN-2. Transcript levels of pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (Pttg1), a pituitary tumor growth marker, were increased; and transcript levels of stress response growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (Gadd45\u03b2) and Cdk5 and ABL enzyme substrate 1 (Cables1) mRNA levels were increased in response to the drug. Gadd45\u03b2 or Cables1 knockdown partially inhibited the DUBs-IN-2-induced decrease in cell proliferation, but not Pomc mRNA levels. Both GADD45\u03b2 and CABLES1 may be responsible, at least in part, for the USP8-induced suppression of corticotroph tumor cell proliferation. USP-8 may be a new treatment target in Cushing's disease.",

In many parts of the world cholera is still endemic, causing outbreaks and constituting repeatedly serious public health problems. The oral live cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR (Orochol, Mutachol), the first genetically modified organism (GMO) used as vaccine, was in its time (launched 1993, Switzerland) the ideal cholera vaccine: single-dose, protective efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus, demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10, 2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera vaccine.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26840484": "The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 directs positioning of the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination in mice and humans. Prdm9 is the only mammalian speciation gene yet identified and is responsible for sterility phenotypes in male hybrids of certain mouse subspecies. To investigate PRDM9 binding and its role in fertility and meiotic recombination, we humanized the DNA-binding domain of PRDM9 in C57BL/6 mice. This change repositions DSB hotspots and completely restores fertility in male hybrids. Here we show that alteration of one Prdm9 allele impacts the behaviour of DSBs controlled by the other allele at chromosome-wide scales. These effects correlate strongly with the degree to which each PRDM9 variant binds both homologues at the DSB sites it controls. Furthermore, higher genome-wide levels of such 'symmetric' PRDM9 binding associate with increasing fertility measures, and comparisons of individual hotspots suggest binding symmetry plays a downstream role in the recombination process. These findings reveal that subspecies-specific degradation of PRDM9 binding sites by meiotic drive, which steadily increases asymmetric PRDM9 binding, has impacts beyond simply changing hotspot positions, and strongly support a direct involvement in hybrid infertility. Because such meiotic drive occurs across mammals, PRDM9 may play a wider, yet transient, role in the early stages of speciation.",

In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to its cognate binding sites. It is one of over 800 genes encoding proteins with zinc finger domains in the human genome. We report a novel technique, Affinity-seq, that for the first time identifies both the genome-wide binding sites of DNA-binding proteins and quantitates their relative affinities. We have applied this in vitro technique to PRDM9, the zinc-finger protein that activates genetic recombination, obtaining new information on the regulation of hotspots, whose locations and activities determine the recombination landscape. We identified 31,770 binding sites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results with hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9 binding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in actively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3 histone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina. These results show that a major factor determining whether a binding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are constraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to bind to DNA in vivo. These constraints lead to the presence of long genomic regions depleted of recombination.",

COs have two striking properties: they occur at specific sites, called hotspots, and these sites evolve rapidly. In mammals, the Prdm9 gene, which encodes a meiosis-specific histone H3 methyltransferase, has recently been identified as a determinant of CO hotspots. Here, using transgenic mice, we show that the sole modification of PRDM9 zinc fingers leads to changes in hotspot activity, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) levels, and chromosome-wide distribution of COs. We further demonstrate by an in vitro assay that the PRDM9 variant associated with hotspot activity binds specifically to DNA sequences located at the center of the three hotspots tested. Remarkably, we show that mutations in cis located at hotspot centers and associated with a decrease of hotspot activity affect PRDM9 binding. Taken together, these results provide the direct demonstration that Prdm9 is a master regulator of hotspot localization through the DNA binding specificity of its zinc finger array and that binding of PRDM9 at hotspots promotes local H3K4me3 enrichment.",

These data reveal varied DNA-binding modalities of PRDM9. We also find that human PRDM9 frequently binds promoters, despite their low recombination rates, and it can activate expression of a small number of genes including <i>CTCFL</i> and <i>VCX</i>. Furthermore, we identify specific sequence motifs that predict consistent, localized meiotic recombination suppression around a subset of PRDM9 binding sites. These motifs strongly associate with KRAB-ZNF protein binding, TRIM28 recruitment, and specific histone modifications. Finally, we demonstrate that, in addition to binding DNA, PRDM9's zinc fingers also mediate its multimerization, and we show that a pair of highly diverged alleles preferentially form homo-multimers.",

PRDM9 specifically recognizes DNA via its tandem array of zinc fingers (ZnFs), epigenetically marks the local chromatin by its histone methyltransferase activity, and is an important tether that brings the DNA into contact with the recombination initiation machinery. A strong correlation between PRDM9-ZnF variants and specific DNA motifs at recombination hotspots has been reported; however, the binding specificity and kinetics of the ZnF domain are still obscure. Using two in vitro methods, gel mobility shift assays and switchSENSE, a quantitative biophysical approach that measures binding rates in real time, we determined that the PRDM9-ZnF domain forms a highly stable and long-lived complex with its recognition sequence, with a dissociation halftime of many hours. The ZnF domain exhibits an equilibrium dissociation constant (K <sub>D</sub>) in the nanomolar (nM) range, with polymorphisms in the recognition sequence directly affecting the binding affinity. We also determined that alternative sequences (15-16 nucleotides in length) can be specifically bound by different subsets of the ZnF domain, explaining the binding plasticity of PRDM9 for different sequences. Finally, longer binding targets are preferred than predicted from the numbers of ZnFs contacting the DNA. Functionally, a long-lived complex translates into an enzymatically active PRDM9 at specific DNA-binding sites throughout meiotic prophase I that might be relevant in stabilizing the components of the recombination machinery to a specific DNA target until DSBs are initiated by Spo11.",

By a combination of yeast-two hybrid assay, in vitro binding, and coimmunoprecipitation from mouse spermatocytes, we identified four proteins that directly interact with PRDM9's KRAB domain, namely CXXC1, EWSR1, EHMT2, and CDYL. These proteins are coexpressed in spermatocytes at the early stages of meiotic prophase I, the limited period when PRDM9 is expressed. We also detected association of PRDM9-bound complexes with the meiotic cohesin REC8 and the synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and SYCP1.

By analyzing mice that express two PRDM9 variants with distinct DNA-binding specificities, we show that each variant generates its own set of H3K4me3 marks independently from the other variant.

We found that although the post-SET zinc finger and the KRAB domains are not essential for the methyltransferase activity of PRDM9 in cell culture, the KRAB domain mutant mice show only residual PRDM9 methyltransferase activity and undergo meiotic arrest.

In normal intestinal epithelium, the COX-2 mRNA is targeted for rapid decay through the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) adenylate- and uridylate (AU)-rich element (ARE), whereas in tumors ARE-mediated decay is compromised. Here we show that the COX-2 ARE can mediate degradation through microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. We identified miR-16 to bind the COX-2 3'-UTR and inhibit COX-2 expression by promoting rapid mRNA decay. In colorectal cancer cells and tumors, miR-16 levels were decreased approximately twofold and miR-16 expression in cancer cells attenuated COX-2 expression and PG synthesis. The COX-2 ARE is also bound by the RNA-binding protein HuR. In colorectal cancer tumors, HuR is overexpressed and localized within the cytoplasm, where it promotes ARE-mRNA stabilization. Under conditions of HuR overexpression, miR-16 was unable to promote rapid mRNA decay through the COX-2 ARE. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation of HuR showed direct association with miR-16 that was reversed when cytoplasmic trafficking of HuR was inhibited. Furthermore, this interaction between HuR and miR-16 promoted the downregulation of miR-16. These new results identify miR-16 as a central posttranscriptional regulator of COX-2 and show the ability of elevated levels of HuR to antagonize miR-16 function. Along with insight into altered ARE-mediated mRNA decay observed in colorectal cancer, these findings provide a new explanation for tumor-derived loss of miR-16.",

After transfecting gastric cancer cells with miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p precursors, Alamar blue and apoptosis assays were used to measure the respective proliferation and apoptosis rates. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays after miR-143 transfection. Reporter plasmids were constructed, and a luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the miR-143 binding site on COX-2. Both miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p were significantly downregulated in multiple gastric cancer cell lines. Forced miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p expression in gastric cancer cells produced a profound cytotoxic effect. MiR-145-5p transfection into gastric cancer cells resulted in a greater growth inhibitory effect (61.23% \u00b1 3.16% vs. 46.58% \u00b1 4.28%, P &lt; 0.05 in the MKN-1 cell line) and a higher apoptosis rate (28.74% \u00b1 1.93% vs. 22.13% \u00b1 3.31%, P &lt; 0.05 in the MKN-1 cell line) than miR-143-3p transfection.

The ability of RelB to regulate COX-2 expression may be via miR-146a, a miRNA that attenuates COX-2 in lung fibroblasts. In this study we tested whether RelB attenuation of cigarette smoke-induced COX-2 protein is due to miR-146a. Utilizing pulmonary fibroblasts deficient in RelB expression, together with siRNA knock-down of RelB, we show the essential role of RelB in diminishing smoke-induced COX-2 protein expression despite robust activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway and subsequent induction of Cox-2 mRNA. RelB did not regulate COX-2 protein expression at the level of mRNA stability. Basal levels of miR-146a were significantly lower in Relb-deficient cells and cigarette smoke increased miR-146a expression only in Relb-expressing cells.

MLE-12 cells were first transfected either with miR-142-3p mimic or miR-142-3p inhibitor and then the cells were exposed to 50 \u03bcg/mL of bleomycin. Thereafter, cell viability, apoptosis and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed using CCK-8, flow cytometry, RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Cox-2, PI3K, AKT and mTOR expressions were detected by western blotting after bleomycin was administered together with NS-398 (an inhibitor of Cox-2). As a result, cell viability was significantly decreased, as well as apoptosis and the expression of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 were remarkably increased after 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL of bleomycin administration. miR-142-3p overexpression alleviated bleomycin-induced apoptosis and overproduction of these two pro-inflammatory cytokines, while miR-142-3p suppression exhibited completely opposite results. Up-regulation of Cox-2 and inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR were found in bleomycin-pretreated cells, while these abnormal regulations were partially abolished by miR-142-3p overexpression and NS-398. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that miR-142-3p overexpression protected bleomycin-induced injury in lung epithelial MLE-12 cells, possibly via regulating Cox-2 expression and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

We demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144 significantly decreased the luciferase reporter activity under the control of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) or mothers against decapentaplegic homologue 4 (Smad4) 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed COX-2 and Smad4 expression.

Moreover, luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results showed that the transcription factor CP2 upregulated miR-144 expression, which partially contributed to the suppression of COX-2 in mGCs. Both CP2 and miR-144 alter prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by regulating COX-2 expression. In addition, miR-144 regulated mGC apoptosis and affected follicular atresia, but these activities did not appear to be through COX-2 and Smad4.

The overexpression of miR-137 inhibited RB cell proliferation and invasion, while the suppression of miR-137 promoted RB cell proliferation and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was a potential target gene of miR-137, which was validated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, our results showed that miR-137 negatively regulated the expression of COX-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in RB cells. The knockdown of COX-2 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of RB cells as well as the production of PGE2. The overexpression of COX-2 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-137 overexpression on RB cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-137 suppresses the proliferation and invasion of RB cells by targeting COX-2/PGE2. Our study reveals a tumor suppressive role of miR-137 in the progression of RB and suggests miR-137 as a potentially effective therapeutic target for the treatment of RB.",

In this study, we identified the expression and function of miR-128, which was found to be downregulated in glioma tissues and glioma cells by real time PCR. Overexpression of miR-128 mimics into LN229 and U251 cells could inhibit proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. However, the inhibitory effects of miR-128 mimics on the invasion and proliferation of glioma cells were reversed by overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Our data showed that COX-2 was a candidate target of miR-128. Luciferase activity of 3'-UTR of COX-2 was reduced in the presence of miR-128. Additionally, miR-128 obviously decreased COX-2 mRNA stability determined by real time PCR. Contrarily, we found that miR-128 inhibitor significantly increased the COX-2 mRNA expression, and elevated the protein expression of MMP9 and ki67, and promoted the proliferation of glioma cells. Furthermore, luciferase activity of the 3'-UTR was upregulated by miR-128 inhibitor. All of these results supported that miR-128 was a direct regulator of COX-2. Further studies proved that COX-2 was elevated in glioma tissues and its expression was negatively correlated with the levels of miR-128. These findings may establish miR-128 as a new potential target for the treatment of patients with gliomas.",

However, the pathological mechanism of cerebral infarction with diabetes (DMCI) is still rarely known. In this study, we try to explore the relationship between microRNA-146b-3p (miR-146b-3p) and DMCI patients. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated after the patients were selected from our hospital. Firstly, the content of IL-6 and COX-2 was detected by ELISA. Then, the total RNAs were extracted and analyzed by microRNA (miRNA) microarray. Moreover, the target genes of miR-146b-3p were predicted by online miRNA target prediction algorithms. Meanwhile, luciferase reporter system was used for assaying the target gene for miRNA-146b-3p. Simultaneously, RT-PCR assay was used for the miRNA expression detection. Furthermore, western blot was applied to determine the expression of the signal pathway involved proteins. Our results demonstrated that expression of IL-6 and COX-2 were remarkably up-regulated in peripheral blood of DMCI patients compared with that in normal control group. In addition, miRNA microarray data suggested that miR-146b-3p expression was significantly down-regulated in DMCI patients, with v-raf-1 expression negatively regulated. Moreover, miR-146b-3p regulated RAF1 expression was found to mediate P38MAPK signaling activation in thrombosis patients. The following research indicated that activation of RAF1 trough miR-146b-3p down-regulation contributed to activation of RAF/P38MAPK/COX-2 signaling pathway in vascular infarction. Our data have implied that altered expression of miR-146b-3p is closely related to the progression and development of DCMI mediating the RAF/P38MAPK/COX-2 signal transduction pathway.",

We hypothesize that miR-101 expression is disrupted in endometrial cancer and modulation of miR-101 levels is sufficient to regulate tumor growth through angiogenesis. We examined the expression levels of miR-101 and factors involved in angiogenesis in the patients with endometrial cancer. We also overexpressed or inhibited miR-101 in RL-95-2 cells and examined their effects on cell toxicity and tumor growth. Finally, we determined if miR-101 regulated tumorigenesis through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We found that miR-101 levels were significantly reduced. Factors involved in angiogenesis included vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and aromatase (P450arom), which were increased in endometrial carcinoma. Modulation of miR-101 level was sufficient to affect tumor growth. Finally, we found that the effects of miR-101 inhibition on tumor growth were suppressed by COX-2 inhibition. Our results suggest that modulating miR-101 and COX-2 levels or their activity may be a potential therapeutic strategy for endometrial cancer.",

We reviewed the institutional database to identify patients with pathologically confirmed, non-metastatic NPC who completed radical 2D-RT or IMRT at our center from 2000 to 2011. We collected data on clinicopathologic features, treatments and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 or STATASE 14.0. The median follow-up was 60.1 months. Of 2315 patients, 1289 (53%) were treated with 2D-RT and 1026 (47%) with IMRT. IMRT group achieved better locoregional control rate, with the 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) were 84.9% and 87.7% among patients received 2D-RT and IMRT, respectively (P = 0.050). IMRT was superior to 2D technique in terms of local relapse-free survival (LRFS) (88.4% vs 91.1%, P = 0.047) and the advantage was only significant in T3-4 subgroup (81.6% vs 90.2%, P = 0.000). Similar neck control rates were observed using different RT techniques. And the recurrence time appeared to be postponed by IMRT, with peaks accounting for the year 1.5 and year 3-4 compared to which was predominant at the first two years using 2D-RT in nature. IMRT provided an improved LRRFS in overall stage and LRFS in advanced T stage for NPC compared with 2D-RT. Annual hazard of recurrence also changed with RT techniques.",

The patients were divided into the local recurrence (n = 39), fibrosis (n = 51), clivus recurrence (n = 22), and clivus nonrecurrence (n = 48) groups. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enhanced MRI, and DWI. Receiver operating characteristics curves were used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values.ADC values were significantly different between the recurrence and fibrosis groups (P &lt; .0001). Using ADC threshold values of 0.887 \u00d7 10 mm/s for local recurrence, the area under the curve (AUC) of DWI was 0.967 (87.2% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity), compared with 0.732 for routine MRI (71.8% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity) (P &lt; .001). Using ADC threshold values of 1.018 \u00d7 10 mm/s for the diagnosis of clivus recurrent NPC, the AUC of DWI was 0.984 (95.5% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity) compared with 0.558 for routine MRI (63.6% sensitivity and 47.9% specificity) (P &lt; .001).DWI has a higher diagnostic value for recurrent NPC than MRI.

In the present study, we used tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2011MS/MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins. Serum was collected from 40 patients with NPC [recurrence (n=20) and no recurrence (n=20)]. Compared to non\u2011recurrent NPC (nrNPC), we found 59 proteins to be significantly dysregulated in rNPC; most of these have been previously reported to play a role in carcinogenesis. The dysregulation of calmodulin (CALM) was confirmed in 74 new patients [recurrence (n=32) and no recurrence (n=42)] by ELISA. Moreover, we performed a preliminary pathway analysis which revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was altered in the patients with rNPC compared to those with nrNPC.

Nomograms for LR-free rate and RR-free rate at 3- and 5- year were generated as visualizations of Cox proportional hazards regression models, and validated using bootstrap resampling, estimating discrimination and calibration. <b><i>Results</i>:</b> With a median follow up of 49.50 months, the 3- and 5- year LR-free rate were 95.43% and 94.30% respectively; the 3- and 5- year RR-free rate were 95.94% and 95.41% respectively. The final predictive model for LR included age, the neutrophil/leukocyte ratio (NWR), pathological type, primary gross tumor volume, maxillary sinus invasion, ethmoidal sinus invasion and lacerated foramen invasion; the model for RR involved NWR, plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA copy number, cervical lymph node volume and N category. The models showed fairly good discriminatory ability with concordance indices (c-indices) of 0.76 and 0.74 for predicting LR and RR, respectively, as well as good calibration. The proposed stratification of risk groups based on the nomograms allowed significant distinction between Kaplan-Meier curves for LR and RR. <b><i>Conclusions</i>:</b> The proposed nomograms resulted in more-accurate prognostic prediction for LR and RR with a high concordance, hence to inform patients with high risk of recurrence on more aggressive therapy.

Eighty-three patients underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, and 205 patients underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy; parotid glands were spared bilaterally in all patients. None of these patients had undergone previous radiotherapy or surgical treatment of the head and neck. Disease recurred in a spared parotid gland in three patients (1.04%). Two of these patients had undergone three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and the third underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy. All three patients had undergone parotidectomy.

The majority of subjects achieved clinical cure with topical retapamulin therapy. Retapamulin 1% ointment was effective against S aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was well tolerated. Retapamulin 1% is effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis infected with S aureus, and demonstrates efficacy against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. Given its efficacy and good tolerability in this pilot study, retapamulin 1% ointment should be further evaluated as a treatment for infected atopic dermatitis.

The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6).

Each subject received a 1-mg dose of ozanimod hydrochloride under 3 meal conditions (fasted, high-fat, and low-fat), each separated by 7 days. Mean plasma concentration-time profiles for ozanimod and its active metabolites (RP101988 [major], RP101075 [minor]) were similar under all 3 conditions. Moreover, all PK parameters for ozanimod, RP101988, and RP101075 were similar under the 3 meal conditions. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of geometric least-squares mean (fed/fasted) were within the equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0-\u221e</sub> ) and maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ) for ozanimod, RP101988, and RP101075, except for the high-fat effect on RP101075 C<sub>max</sub> (90%CI, 0.76-0.88).

Until now, the four orally available medications, fingolimod, dimethylfumarate (BG-12), teriflunomide, and cladribine have received market authorization, whereas laquinimod is still under development. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor, which is typically used as escalation therapy and leads to up to 60% reduction of the annualized relapse rate, but might also have neuroprotective properties. In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. Dimethylfumarate has immunomodulatory and cytoprotective functions and is used as baseline therapy. Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of the rheumatoid arthritis medication leflunomide, targets the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thus inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes by depletion of pyrimidines.

Ozanimod and its active metabolite, RP-101075, exhibit a similar specificity profile at the S1P receptor family in vitro and pharmacodynamic profile in vivo. The NZBWF1 mouse model was used in therapeutic dosing mode to assess the potential benefit of ozanimod and RP-101075 in an established animal model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Compared with vehicle-treated animals, ozanimod and RP-101075 reduced proteinuria over the duration of the study and serum blood urea nitrogen at termination. Additionally, ozanimod and RP-101075 reduced kidney disease in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by histological assessment of mesangial expansion, endo- and exo-capillary proliferation, interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis, glomerular deposits, and tubular atrophy. Further exploration into gene expression changes in the kidney demonstrate that RP-101075 also significantly reduced expression of fibrotic and immune-related genes in the kidneys. Of note, RP-101075 lowered the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, a major source of interferon alpha in lupus patients, and reduced all B and T cell subsets in the spleen. Given the efficacy demonstrated by ozanimod and its metabolite RP-101075 in the NZBWF1 preclinical animal model, ozanimod may warrant clinical evaluation as a potential treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus.",

The introduction of biological therapies including anti-TNF, anti-IL-12/23, and anti-integrins, has revolutionized the treatment of IBD, but these drugs are not universally effective. Due to the complex molecular structures of biologics, they are uniformly immunogenic. New discoveries concerning the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBD have allowed for progress in the development of new treatment options. The advantage of small molecules (SMs) over biological therapies includes their lack of immunogenicity, short half-life, oral administration, and low manufacturing cost. Among these, the Janus Kinases (JAKs) inhibition has emerged as a novel strategy to modulate downstream cytokine signaling during immune-mediated diseases. These drugs target various cytokine signaling pathways that participate in the pathogenesis of IBD. Tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor targeting predominantly JAK1 and JAK3, has been approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), and there are other specific JAK inhibitors under development that may be effective in Crohn's. Similarly, the traffic of lymphocytes can now be targeted by another SM. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonism is a novel strategy that acts, in part, by interfering with lymphocyte recirculation, through blockade of lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. S1PR agonists are being studied in IBD and other immune-mediated disorders. This review will focus on SM drugs approved and under development, including JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib, peficitinib) and S1PR agonists (KRP-203, fingolimod, ozanimod, etrasimod, amiselimod), and their mechanism of action.",

There are four mammalian syndecans, SDC-1 thorough 4, which play a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis through independent and growth factor mediated signaling. An altered expression of SDCs is often observed in autoimmune disorders, cancer, HIV infection, and many other pathological conditions. SDCs modulate disease progression by interacting with a diverse array of ligands, receptors, and other proteins, including extracellular matrix, glycoproteins, integrins, morphogens, and various growth factors and chemokines, along with their receptors and kinases. Specifically, SDCs present on cell surface can bind directly to chemokines to enhance their binding to receptors, downstream signaling, and migration. Alternatively, SDCs can be cleaved and shed to mediate negative regulation of chemokine and growth factor signaling pathways and ligand sequestration. Importantly, SDC shedding may be a biomarker of inflammation, especially in chronic inflammatory diseases. While the current therapies for cancer and several autoimmune disorders have revolutionized treatment outcomes, understanding the pathophysiological role of SDCs and the use of HSPG mimetic or antagonists on cytokine signaling networks may uncover potentially novel targeted therapeutic approaches. This review mainly summarizes the current findings on the role of individual SDCs in disease processes, mechanisms through which SDCs mediate their biological functions, and the possibility of targeting SDCs as future potential therapeutic approaches.",

We previously showed that syndecan-2 controls the growth of normal human osteoblastic cells. In this study, we examined the role of syndecan-2 in osteosarcoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. To this goal, MG63 osteosarcoma cells which express low syndecan-2 levels were transfected to overexpress full-length syndecan-2 or truncated syndecan-2 lacking its cytoplasmic domain. Determination of cell growth by cell counting and 3H-thymidine incorporation showed that truncated syndecan-2 inhibited MG63 cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content and colony forming test revealed that syndecan-2, but not truncated syndecan-2, induced MG63 cell death. We show that characteristic features of apoptosis such as caspase activation, PARP cleavage, cytochrome c release, increased Bax expression, and DNA fragmentation were associated with syndecan-2-induced cell death. We further show that expression of full-length or truncated syndecan-2 induced differential activation of MAPK phosphorylation in MG63 cells. Notably, syndecan-2 but not truncated syndecan-2 overexpression increased JNK phosphorylation. Moreover, SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK, suppressed Bax expression induced by syndecan-2 overexpression, indicating that JNK activation mediates syndecan-2-induced apoptosis. The results show that syndecan-2 induces osteoblastic cell apoptosis through the JNK/Bax apoptotic pathway and that the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 is required for this action.

We found that syndecan-2 mutants in which the TMD had been replaced with that of syndecan-4 were defective in syndecan-2-mediated functions, suggesting that the TMD of syndecan-2 plays one or more specific roles. Interestingly, syndecan-2 has a stronger tendency to form sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant homodimers than syndecan-4. Our structural studies showed that a unique phenylalanine residue (Phe(167)) enables an additional molecular interaction between the TMDs of the syndecan-2 homodimer. The presence of Phe(167) was correlated with a higher tendency toward oligomerization, and its replacement with isoleucine significantly reduced the SDS-resistant dimer formation and cellular functions of syndecan-2 (e.g. cell migration). Conversely, replacement of isoleucine with phenylalanine at this position in the syndecan-4 TMD rescued the defects observed in a mutant syndecan-2 harboring the syndecan-4 TMD. Taken together, these data suggest that Phe(167) in the TMD of syndecan-2 endows the protein with specific functions. Our work offers new insights into the signaling mediated by the TMD of syndecan family members.",

Although syndecans have been cloned from several invertebrate and vertebrate species, the extent of conservation of the family across the animal kingdom is unknown and there are gaps in our knowledge of chordate syndecans. Here, we develop a new level of knowledge for the whole syndecan family, by combining molecular phylogeny of syndecan protein sequences with analysis of the genomic contexts of syndecan genes in multiple vertebrate organisms. We identified syndecan-encoding sequences in representative Cnidaria and throughout the Bilateria. The C1 and C2 regions of the cytoplasmic domain are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom. We identified in the variable region a universally-conserved leucine residue and a tyrosine residue that is conserved throughout the Bilateria. Of all the genomes examined, only tetrapod and fish genomes encode multiple syndecans. No syndecan-1 was identified in fish. The genomic context of each vertebrate syndecan gene is syntenic between human, mouse and chicken, and this conservation clearly extends to syndecan-2 and -3 in T. nigroviridis. In addition, tetrapod syndecans were found to be encoded from paralogous chromosomal regions that also contain the four members of the matrilin family. Whereas the matrilin-3 and syndecan-1 genes are adjacent in tetrapods, this chromosomal region appears to have undergone extensive lineage-specific rearrangements in fish. Throughout the animal kingdom, syndecan extracellular domains have undergone rapid change and elements of the cytoplasmic domains have been very conserved. The four syndecan genes of vertebrates are syntenic across tetrapods, and synteny of the syndecan-2 and -3 genes is apparent between tetrapods and fish. In vertebrates, each of the four family members are encoded from paralogous genomic regions in which members of the matrilin family are also syntenic between tetrapods and fish. This genomic organization appears to have been set up after the divergence of urochordates (Ciona) and vertebrates. The syndecan-1 gene appears to have been lost relatively early in the fish lineage. These conclusions provide the basis for a new model of syndecan evolution in vertebrates and a new perspective for analyzing the roles of syndecans in cells and whole organisms.",

Although syndecans play a major role in regulating cell morphology, little is known about their subcellular distribution and in vivo association with the cytoskeleton. To address this question, we investigated the subcellular distribution and dynamic rearrangement of syndecans-1, -2, and -4, using confocal laser microscopy. Furthermore, we monitored the spatial relation of syndecans to tubulin in both mitotic and interphase cells. Initially, the reactivity to syndecans was confined to the cytoplasm, staining of the cell membranes appearing later. Syndecan-1 also seems to translocate to the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. The mitotic spindle shows unexpectedly more syndecans than that found in interphase cells. After vinblastine treatment, both syndecan-1 and tubulin were recovered as paracrystalline occlusion bodies, and the nuclear reactivity to syndecan-1 disappeared, suggesting tubulin-mediated nuclear transport of this proteoglycan. Plasma membrane staining reappeared in the postmitotic cells. Nuclear translocation predominantly affected syndecan-1, whereas syndecan-2 and -4 remained in cytoplasm and cell membrane. This is the first report on regulated nuclear translocation and the presence of syndecan-1 in the mitotic spindle, where it may stabilize the mitotic machinery. The syndecan-1/tubulin complex may also act as a vehicle for the transport of protein growth factors to the cell nucleus.",

Syndecans are expressed in a tissue-specific manner to facilitate diverse cellular processes. As receptors and co-receptors, syndecans provide promising therapeutic targets that bind to a variety of physiologically important ligands. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans, located in the extracellular compartment, are critical for such binding. Functions of syndecans are as diverse as their ligands. For example, hepatic syndecan-1 mediates clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Syndecan-2 promotes localization of Alzheimer's amyloid A\u03b2 peptide to the cell surface, which is proposed to contribute to amyloid plaque formation. Syndecan-3 helps co-localize the appetite-regulating melanocortin-4 receptor with its agonist, leading to an increased appetite. Finally, syndecan-4 initiates the capture of modified low-density lipoproteins by macrophages and thereby promotes the atheroma formation. We hypothesize that syndecan modifications such as desulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains may contribute to a wide range of diseases, from atherosclerosis to type 2 diabetes. At the same time, desulfated syndecans may have beneficial effects, as they can inhibit amyloid plaque formation or decrease the appetite. Despite considerable progress in understanding diverse functions of syndecans, the complex physiological roles of this intriguing family of proteoglycans are far from clear. Additional studies of syndecans may potentially help develop novel therapeutic approaches and diagnostic tools to alleviate complex human diseases such as cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases.",

To determine whether syndecans can function during wound repair, we have examined expression of the syndecans during wound repair of adult mouse and neonatal or fetal human skin. Syndecan-1 and -4 were induced in the dermis within 12 h after incisional injury of murine or neonatal human skin. Syndecan-1 was induced primarily on endothelium, and syndecan-4 was present throughout the dermis at the site of injury. Following re-epithelialization, expression of the syndecans return to their baseline level. In marked contrast to these observations, wounded human fetal skin showed no increase in expression of syndecans. This lack of increase in the expression of syndecans by cells of the dermis correlates with prior observations that fetal skin heals without a polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate, appreciable fibrosis, or clinically apparent scar. Thus, induced expression of syndecans is not an absolute requirement for wound repair but does correlate with the occurrence of fibrosis in mature skin. These findings support the role of syndecans as regulators of cell behavior and suggest that syndecan-1 and -4 induction in the dermis may contribute to events that lead to inflammation and fibrosis.",

They have been associated with multiple functions in tumour progression, through their ability to interact with a wide range of ligands as well as other receptors, which makes them key effectors in the pericellular microenvironment. Extracellular shedding of syndecans by tumour-associated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may have an important role in tumour progression. Such ectodomain shedding generates soluble ectodomains that may function as paracrine or autocrine effectors, or as competitive inhibitors of the intact proteoglycan. Tumour-associated MMPs are shown here to cleave the ectodomains of human syndecan-1 and syndecan-4. Two membrane proximal regions of both syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 are favoured MMP cleavage sites, six and 15 residues from the transmembrane domain. Other sites are 35-40 residues C-terminal from the heparan sulfate chain substitution sites in both syndecans. The MT1-MMP cleavage sites in syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. These findings provide insights into the characteristics of syndecan shedding.",

One mechanism of action is thought to be though the ability of biologics to induce homing and migration of endogenous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to a target tissue. However, the ability of biologics to stimulate chemotaxis (directed migration of cells) and chemokinesis (increase rate of cell migration) of MSCs is unknown. The aim of this study was to directly compare the ability of biologics including platelet rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to induce MSC migration. The hypothesis was that leukocyte-low platelet rich plasma (Llo PRP) would induce migration to a greater extent than leukocyte-high platelet rich plasma (Lhi PRP) or BMC. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from 8 horses. Migration of MSCs toward a biologic (BMC, Llo PRP, and Lhi PRP) or the positive control platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was continuously traced and measured for 24hrs using time-lapse microscopy and a microfluidics device. Cell migration, chemotaxis and chemokinesis were determined by measurements of displacement, number of cells migrated, and cell flux. All biologics resulted in a significantly greater percentage of MSCs migrated compared to the positive control (PDGF). MSCs migrated further toward BMC compared to Llo PRP. Cell migration, measured as cell flux, was greater toward BMC and Lhi PRP than Llo PRP. The biologics BMC and Lhi PRP elicit greater chemotaxis and chemokinesis of MSCs than Llo PRP. However, all biologics recruited the same number of MSCs suggesting that differences in other regenerative effects, such as growth factor concentration, between biologics should be strongly considered when choosing a biologic for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. The results of this study have the potential to reduce the need, risks, and costs associated with MSC culture and delivery.",

HA and HYALs are intricately involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Random cell movement is generally described as chemokinesis, and represents an important step at the beginning of tumor cell liberation from the primary site. To investigate the roles of HAS2 and HYAL2/CD44 in cell motility, we examined HeLa-S3 cells showing spontaneous chemokinesis. HeLa-S3 cells expressed HAS2 and HAS3. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HAS2 decreased spontaneous chemokinesis of HeLa-S3 cells. Although HeLa-S3 cells secreted 50 ng/ml of high molecular weight (HMW)-HA (peak: 990 kDa) into the culture supernatant after 6 h of culture, exogenously added HMW-HA did not enhance spontaneous chemokinesis of the cells. These observations suggested that HeLa-S3 cells may have a self-degrading system for HA to regulate their spontaneous chemokinesis. To examine this possibility, we investigated the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of HYAL2 or CD44 on the spontaneous chemokinesis of HeLa-S3 cells. Knockdown of either molecule decreased the spontaneous chemokinesis of the cells. Low molecular weight (LMW)-HA (23 kDa) reversed the HYAL2 siRNA-mediated reduction in spontaneous chemokinesis of HeLa-S3 cells to the level in control cells stimulated with the same HA. These findings indicate that the HAS2-HYAL2/CD44 system may support spontaneous chemokinesis of human cancer cells through self-degradation of HMW-HA to produce LMW-HA by an autocrine mechanism. Consequently, our study may further expand our understanding of HA functions in cancer.",

This study demonstrates that in addition to orientation (chemotaxis), stimulated speed (chemokinesis) is an important component of the directed migration of these amoebae. Furthermore, the primary difference in their response to folate versus pterin is in speed rather than orientation. The data support a model of directed migration of these cells in which there are (1) separate signal translation pathways consequent from folate versus pterin reception and (2) specific pathways leading to increase in orientation versus speed.",

Eosinophil migration in vitro can be divided into directed migration, or chemotaxis, and random migration, or chemokinesis. Here, we studied intracellular signals involved in eosinophil migration in vitro induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF) and interleukin-5 (IL-5), applying a Boyden chamber assay. Migration induced by PAF (10(-11)-10(-6) M) largely consisted of chemotaxis with some chemokinesis, whereas IL-5 (10(-12)-10(-8) M) induced chemokinesis only. Eosinophils were depleted from intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ to study the role of Ca2+ as a second messenger. Ca2+ depletion did not change PAF-induced chemotaxis, however, IL-5-induced chemokinesis was inhibited. Interestingly, PAF, but not IL-5, induced changes in [Ca2+]i. This rise originated mainly from internal stores. Inhibition of protein kinase A by H-89 and protein kinase C by GF 109203X had no effect on both forms of eosinophil migration. Addition of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine significantly inhibited IL-5-induced chemokinesis. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases by herbimycin A completely blocked IL-5-induced chemokinesis. PAF and IL-5-induced actin polymerization was studied to compare migratory responses with a migration-associated intracellular response. Ca2+ depletion significantly enhanced PAF-induced (10(-8) M) actin polymerization, whereas IL-5-induced actin polymerization was not influenced. Addition of staurosporine led to an increase in F-actin. Subsequent addition of PAF or IL-5 resulted in an additive increase in F-actin content. In summary, both forms of eosinophil migration are protein kinase A and protein kinase C independent. In contrast to PAF-induced chemotaxis, Il-5-induced chemokinesis was found to be completely Ca2+ and tyrosine kinase dependent.",

Since tumor cell motility plays an important role in the process of tumor invasion and metastasis, we investigated these two distinct motile behaviors in highly invasive tumor, malignant mesothelioma. Chemotaxis and chemokinesis of mesothelioma cells were assayed using Boyden chambers fitted with filters coated with collagen type IV and different growth factors and cytokines were used as chemoattractants. We found that growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, amphiregulin, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, beta-cellulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor-II and stem cell factor stimulated directional (chemotactic) and/or random (chemokinetic) motility in all mesothelioma cell lines tested, whereas none of acidic fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-6 induced migration in the same mesothelioma cells. These findings provide evidence that: (i) multiple growth factors can induce chemotaxis and chemokinesis in malignant mesothelioma cell lines, and (ii) may contribute to our understanding of the highly invasive behavior of malignant mesotheliomas in vivo.",

This study investigated the effect of SOCS on cholinergic pathway regulation of synovitis in the fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of RA and CIA mice. The effects of nicotine on SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein expression in FLSs were assayed by western blotting before and after transfection with a small interfering RNA oligonucleotide (SOCS3-siRNA or control-siRNA).

Histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical staining of SOCS3 were performed in joint tissue sections of control, CIA model, vagotomy, and nicotine-treated DBA/1 mice. Nicotine increased SOCS3 expression in the FLSs of RA. The inhibitory effect of nicotine on inflammatory factors was abolished by siRNA knockdown of SOCS3 protein expression.

Recent studies on the genomic landscape of gastric adenocarcinoma have identified several key signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) members, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR) members and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components, that have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancers. However, clinical trials with compounds that target these molecules have failed to show a significant improvement in overall survival rates when supplemented with conventional therapies.

To further evaluate what risk, if any, that intracranial meningioma might be associated with dental X-rays, we examined the association of benign brain tumor incidence with the number of dentists and other correlates of oral health in U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We compared these correlations to the association of the same markers of oral health with Alzheimer's death rates. Poor oral health, especially periodontal disease, is a well-established risk factor for dementia. Pearson correlations, number of cases (49, no data from Kansas or Maryland) and significance (2 tailed p values) of benign brain tumor incidence and parameters of oral health are presented. None of the correlations approached statistical significance. In contrast, Alzheimer's deaths by state were negatively correlated with number of dentists and other markers of oral health. Our finding of a total lack of correlation between benign brain tumors and markers of oral health and, by implication, dental X-rays, suggests there may be no relationship between dental X-rays and meningioma or other benign brain tumors.

The objective of this study was to examine the association between dental x-rays-the most common artificial source of ionizing radiation-and the risk of intracranial meningioma. This population-based case-control study included 1433 patients who had intracranial meningioma diagnosed at ages 20 to 79 years and were residents of the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area, and 8 counties in Houston, Texas between May 1, 2006 and April 28, 2011 (cases). A control group of 1350 individuals was frequency matched on age, sex, and geography (controls). The main outcome measure for the study was the association between a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma and self-reported bitewing, full-mouth, and panorex dental x-rays. Over a lifetime, cases were more than twice as likely as controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.9) to report having ever had a bitewing examination. Regardless of the age at which the films were obtained, individuals who reported receiving bitewing films on a yearly basis or with greater frequency had an elevated risk for ages &lt;10 years (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8), ages 10 to 19 years (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0), ages 20 to 49 years (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6), and ages \u226540 years (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0).

The BBT odds ratio increased from 1.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.44] for those with annual mean X-ray examination of less than one to 1.65 (95% CI 1.37-1.98) for those with three or more X-ray examinations, after controlling for comorbidities. No significant association was found between MBTs and dental diagnostic X-ray exposure. Exposure to dental diagnostic X-rays in oral and maxillofacial care increases the risk of BBTs, but not MBTs.",

In a case-control study in a rural town, we interviewed surrogates of cases and controls about potential risk factors. We found a statistically significant positive association of brain cancer with reported exposure to dental X-rays. Occupation was not associated with the cluster in the rural town. In a standardized proportional mortality study for the state of Missouri, we calculated the observed and expected proportion of brain cancers by occupation and industry in Missouri decedents. We found that motor vehicle manufacturers, beauty shop workers, managers and administrators, elementary school teachers, and hairdressers and cosmetologists had significantly elevated proportions of brain cancer. Brain tumors are inconsistently associated with occupation in the literature. Further study of brain cancer etiology with respect to dental X-ray exposures seems warranted.",

Considering the high lifetime prevalence and frequency of exposure to dental X-rays, the most common source of diagnostic radiation exposure in the general population, even a small associated increase in cancer risk would be of considerable public health importance. With the objective to inform clinical practice and guidelines, we synthesized the current epidemiological evidence on the association between dental X-rays and the risk of thyroid cancer, meningioma, and other cancers of the head and neck region. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Summary odds ratio/relative risk estimates and confidence intervals were extracted, and pooled risk ratios (RRs) for each cancer were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The literature search identified 5537 publications; of these, 26 studies including 10,868 cancer patients were included in the synthesis. The random effects meta-analyses, based on seven studies of thyroid cancer (six case/control, one cohort) and eight studies of meningioma (all case/control), showed that multiple (or repeated) exposures to dental X-rays were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer (pooled RR = 1.87 [95% confidence interval, CI 1.11-3.15]) and meningioma (pooled RR = 1.53 [CI 1.26-1.85]). There was no association with glioma, and there were too few studies of other cancers of the head and neck region to conduct a meaningful meta-analysis. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Based on a meta-analysis of retrospective case/control studies, these findings provide some support to the hypothesis that multiple (or repeated) exposures to dental X-rays may be associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer and meningioma. These studies did not include individual organ doses and ages at exposure, and are subject to recall bias and other limitations. Furthermore, the thyroid exposure has decreased dramatically over time from the use of thyroid shields and improved technology/equipment. Prospective studies, based on dental X-ray records and patient follow-up, are needed to test the hypothesis further and clarify the possible cancer risk associated with dental radiography, as although the risk at the individual level, particularly with improved technology/equipment, is likely to be very low, the proportion of the population exposed is high. Considering that about one-third of the general population in developed countries is routinely exposed to one or more dental X-rays per year, these findings manifest the need to reduce diagnostic radiation exposure as much as possible.",

We examined the effectiveness of RotaTeq in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) hospitalization in Israel, after the introduction of universal immunization against the disease. A test-negative case-control study included age-eligible children for universal RotaTeq immunization (aged 2-59 months, born in 2011-2015). Cases (n = 98) were patients who tested positive for rotavirus by immunochromatography; those who tested negative (n = 628) comprised the control group. Information on rotavirus immunization history was obtained through linkage with a national immunization registry. Vaccination status was compared between cases and controls, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were obtained from logistic regression models, and vaccine effectiveness calculated as (1 - aOR)*100. Immunization with RotaTeq was less frequent in RVGE cases (73.5%) than in controls (90.1%), p &lt; 0.001; this association persisted after controlling for potential confounders. Effectiveness of the complete vaccine series was estimated at 77% (95% confidence interval (CI): 49-90) in children aged 6-59 months, and 86% (95% CI: 65-94) in children aged 6-23 months; whereas for the incomplete series, the respective estimates were 72% (95% CI: 28-89) and 75% (95% CI: 30-91). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 79% (95% CI: 45-92) against G1P[8]-associated RVGE hospitalizations and 69% (95% CI: 11-89) against other genotype-RVGE hospitalizations. High effectiveness of RotaTeq as the sole rotavirus vaccine in a universal immunization programme was demonstrated in a high-income country. Although partial vaccination conferred protection, completing the vaccine series is warranted to maximize the benefit.",

Rotavirus vaccines are underused compared with other routine vaccines. We describe rotavirus vaccine coverage and missed opportunities for rotavirus vaccination. The National Immunization Survey is a random-digit-dial, population-based survey including US children 19 to 35 months of age. Children fully vaccinated for rotavirus were those who received 3 doses of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, 2 doses of the monovalent rotavirus vaccine, or \u22653 doses of either vaccine type. Doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine received from 6 weeks through 8 months and 0 days of age when the rotavirus vaccine was not received were considered missed opportunities for rotavirus vaccination according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines, and doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine or measles-mumps-rubella vaccine from 6 weeks through 24 months and 0 days of age were considered missed opportunities according to World Health Organization recommendations. Of the 14 571 children included in the 2014 National Immunization Survey, 71% were fully vaccinated for rotavirus. Lower socioeconomic status increased the likelihood of being unvaccinated for rotavirus. Among the 14% of children who received no doses of the rotavirus vaccine, 72% had \u22651 ACIP-defined missed opportunities, and 83% had \u22651 World Health Organization-defined missed opportunities. Higher socioeconomic status increased the likelihood of having missed opportunities. Complete rotavirus vaccine coverage could be improved to 81% if all missed opportunities within the ACIP-recommended schedule were addressed. Addressing missed opportunities for rotavirus vaccination is essential to achieving the 80% rotavirus vaccine coverage target outlined by Healthy People 2020.",

Although Norway has a high coverage for routine childhood vaccines, these stringent age limits could negatively affect rotavirus coverage. We documented the status and impact of rotavirus vaccination on other infant vaccines during the first year after its introduction. We used individual vaccination data from the national immunisation register to calculate coverage for rotavirus and other vaccines and examine adherence with the recommended schedules. We identified factors associated with completing the full rotavirus series by performing multiple logistic regression analyses. We also evaluated potential changes in uptake and timeliness of other routine vaccines after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine using the Kaplan-Meier method. The national coverage for rotavirus vaccine achieved a year after the introduction was 89% for one dose and 82% for two doses, respectively. Among fully rotavirus-vaccinated children, 98% received both doses within the upper age limit and 90% received both doses according to the recommended schedule. The child's age at the initiation of rotavirus series and being vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP/IPV/Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines were the strongest predictors of completing the full rotavirus series. No major changes in uptake and timeliness of other paediatric vaccines were observed after introduction of rotavirus vaccine. Norway achieved a high national coverage and excellent adherence with the strict age limits for rotavirus vaccine administration during the first year of introduction, indicating robustness of the national immunisation programme. Rotavirus vaccination did not impact coverage or timeliness of other infant vaccines.",

However, rotavirus vaccination coverage continues to lag behind that of pentavalent vaccine, even in years when national rotavirus vaccine stock-outs have not occurred. We analyzed factors associated with receipt of oral rotavirus vaccine among children who received at least 2 doses of pentavalent vaccine in a stratified cluster survey of children aged 24-59 months conducted in El Salvador in 2011. Vaccine doses included were documented on vaccination cards (94.4%) or in health facility records (5.6%). Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to assess factors associated with vaccination status and age at vaccination. Receipt of pentavalent vaccine by age 15 weeks was associated with rotavirus vaccination (OR: 5.1; 95% CI 2.7, 9.4), and receipt of the second pentavalent dose by age 32 weeks was associated with receipt of two rotavirus vaccine doses (OR: 5.0; 95% CI 2.1-12.3). Timely coverage with the first pentavalent vaccine dose was 88.2% in the 2007 cohort and 91.1% in the 2008 cohort (p=0.04). Children born in 2009, when a four-month national rotavirus vaccine stock-out occurred, had an older median age of receipt of rotavirus vaccine and were less likely to receive rotavirus on the same date as the same dose of pentavalent vaccine than children born in 2007 and 2008. Upper age limit recommendations for rotavirus vaccine administration contributed to suboptimal vaccination coverage. Survey data suggest that late rotavirus vaccination and co-administration with later doses of pentavalent vaccine among children born in 2009 helped increase rotavirus vaccine coverage following shortages.",

A prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-three centers in the United States. A total of 1006 healthy infants between 4 and 26 weeks of age were enrolled, and 898 received three doses of vaccine or placebo. Reactogenicity was determined by comparing the incidence of fever, diarrhea, and/or vomiting for 5 days after each dose of vaccine. Rotavirus IgA and neutralizing antibody to rhesus rotavirus and four rotavirus serotypes were measured in a subset of subjects. Relative efficacy was determined by comparing the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis after three doses of vaccine or placebo over two rotavirus seasons. Adverse reactions were mild and limited to a small but significant increase in the incidence of fever after the first dose of tetravalent but not monovalent vaccine. The relative efficacy against rotavirus disease over the 2 years of observation was 40% (98.3% confidence interval, 7% to 62%) for the monovalent and 57% (98.3% confidence interval, 29% to 74%) for the tetravalent vaccine. In post hoc analyses, the relative efficacy against very severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was 73% and 82% for monovalent and tetravalent vaccine recipients, respectively. Also, a 67% and 78% reduction in medical visits for rotavirus gastroenteritis was observed. Both vaccines protected against disease caused by serotype 1 rotavirus, but only the tetravalent vaccine reduced the incidence of disease caused by non-serotype 1 rotavirus infection detected in the second season. It is unclear, however, whether this result represents serotype-specific protection or a difference in the duration of protection. Vaccination with both vaccines was safe and significantly reduced the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis, but only the tetravalent vaccine provided protection against disease caused by non-serotype 1 rotaviruses during the second year of follow-up.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25680314": "By January 2015, rotavirus vaccination had been implemented in national vaccination programmes in 75 countries worldwide. Two live oral rotavirus vaccines are internationally available: human, monovalent vaccine and human-bovine pentavalent reassortant vaccine. Since January 2014, another live, oral human-bovine monovalent vaccine has been available in India. After implementation of rotavirus vaccines in childhood immunization programmes, there has been an over 90% reduction of rotavirus hospitalizations in industrialized and resource-deprived countries. Additionally, in Latin America, significant reduction of rotavirus-associated deaths has been recorded. Still, numerous countries do not recommend rotavirus mass vaccination because of assumed lack of cost-effectiveness and potential risk of intussusception, which is estimated at 1 per 50 000-70 000 doses of rotavirus vaccines. Cost-effectiveness of vaccination is affected in some countries by high price. Inclusion of herd protection and indirect costs in calculations for cost-effectiveness results in clear benefit: costs saved by health systems due to reduced rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalizations far exceed the costs for implementation of rotavirus vaccination. There have been objections that high rotavirus vaccination coverage could put selective pressure on certain rotavirus strains against which protection after vaccination is less distinct. However, data now strongly suggest that even if there might be a relative increase of some specific genotypes after the use of rotavirus vaccines, this is not an absolute increase in incidence from certain genotypes and does not affect the overall effectiveness of rotavirus mass vaccination, which resulted in a major decrease of severe cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis in both industrialized and resource deprived countries.",

The main problem encountered with this vaccine was its poor \"take\" rate in developing countries. The reasons for this are unclear, and it is not known whether other bovine rotavirus vaccines are more efficacious in this respect. WC-3 bovine rotavirus vaccine will shortly be tested at several sites in developing countries. The rhesus rotavirus vaccine RRV-1 does not appear by itself to be a practical vaccine either. It has induced only moderate protection against human rotavirus serotypes other than the vaccine type. However, the fact that RRV-1 vaccine has induced substantial protection against severe diarrhoea caused by serotype 3 rotavirus, even in young infants, is promising and supports the concept that serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies play a role in protection against human rotavirus disease. Based on this concept, it has been possible to develop reassortant rhesus rotaviruses in which one RNA segment of human rotavirus, which encodes the expression of VP7 antigen, has been incorporated (Kapikian et al., 1986; 1987). Such rhesus-human reassortant rotaviruses, representing serotypes 1, 2 and 4 of human rotavirus and serotype 3 of rhesus rotavirus, can be combined to make a tetravalent vaccine that might induce neutralizing antibodies against each of the main serotypes of human rotavirus. Although its efficacy is unproven, such a combination vaccine is presently regarded as the most promising candidate rotavirus vaccine for the prevention of human rotavirus disease.",

By 2015, 14 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) East and Southern Africa sub-region (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) were participating in the rotavirus surveillance network coordinated by WHO. We monitored the proportion of rotavirus diarrhoea among children under five years of age who were hospitalized for diarrhoea in the sentinel hospitals from 2010 to 2015 among countries that introduced rotavirus vaccine during or before 2013 (Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Ethiopia) and compared with the other countries in the network. Children under the age of five years hospitalized due to acute diarrhoea were enrolled into the sentinel surveillance system and had stool samples collected and tested for rotavirus antigens by enzyme immunoassay. We described trends in rotavirus positivity among tested stool samples before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction. In countries that introduced rotavirus vaccine by 2013 (Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Ethiopia), average rotavirus vaccine coverage from 2010 to 2015 improved from 0% in 2010 and 2011, 13% in 2012, 46% in 2013, 83% in 2014 to 90% in 2015. Annual average rotavirus positivity from 2010 to 2015 was 35%, 33%, 38%, 28%, 27%, and 19%, respectively.

Only the RRV vaccine was associated with a febrile response (&lt; 38 degrees C) that occurred in 9% of the infants on day 4 after vaccination. Diarrhea or other side-effects were not associated with administration of vaccine. Vaccine strains were shed by only 12-18% of the infants as determined by examination of a single stool specimen obtained on days 4 or 5 after vaccination. Fifty per cent of vaccines developed an IgA ELISA seroresponse; however, a serotype-specific seroresponse by plaque reduction neutralization was demonstrated in &lt; 20% of the participants against each of the three candidate vaccine strains. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated by twice-weekly home surveillance for diarrheal diseases during 24 months post-immunization. Rotavirus diarrheal episodes were identified by ELISA. Only the RRV vaccine had a significant protective efficacy (29%, p = 0.03, chi-square test) against rotavirus diarrhea. Analysis of vaccine efficacy against rotavirus episodes of any severity in which no other enteropathogen was isolated showed a trend towards higher vaccine efficacy. In addition, a similar trend was observed in rotavirus-only episodes in which there was some degree of dehydration or when health services were utilized. Serotype G1 or G2 rotavirus strains were most prevalent during surveillance. Neither serotype G1 or serotype G2 vaccines were protective against serotype 1 or 2 rotavirus diarrhea, respectively. The serotype G2 vaccine was 84% protective against serotype 1 and 2 dehydrating rotavirus diarrhea in the small numbers of individuals evaluated. We conclude that one dose of 10(4) p.f.u. of the RRV, serotype G1, or serotype G2 rotavirus vaccine failed to induce either an adequate serotype-specific seroresponse or serotype-specific protection in children immunized at 2 months of age. Only the RRV vaccine induced a low level of protection against rotavirus diarrhea mainly of serotype G1 specificity. Future studies need to explore whether higher vaccine dose and/or more than one dose would increase the immunogenicity and efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine, especially in developing countries with a high level of baseline rotavirus antibodies.",

Vietnam is situated in the region of high rotavirus infection incidence and eligible for financial support to introduce rotavirus vaccines into the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) from the GAVI. This study was designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immunization in Vietnam, explicitly the use of Rotateq(\u00ae) and to assess the affordability of implementing universal rotavirus immunization based on GAVI-subsidized vaccine price in the context of Vietnamese healthcare system for the next 5 years. An age-structured cohort model was developed for the 2009 birth cohort in Vietnam. Two strategies were compared: one being the current situation without vaccination, and the other being mass universal rotavirus vaccination. The time horizon of the model was 5 years with time cycles of 1 month for children less than 1 year of age and annual analysis thereafter. Outcomes included mild, moderate, severe cases and death. Multiple outcomes per rotavirus infection are possible in the model. Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the acceptability and affordability of the rotavirus vaccination. All costs were expressed in 2009 US$. Rotavirus vaccination would not completely protect young children against rotavirus infection due to partial nature of vaccine immunity, however, would effectively reduce severe cases of rotavirus by roughly 55% during the first 5 years of life. Under GAVI-subsidized vaccine price (US$ 0.3/dose), the vaccine cost would amount to US$ 5.5 million per annum for 3-dose of the Rotateq(\u00ae) vaccine. In the base-case, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) was US$ 665 from the health system perspective, much lower than per-capita GDP of \u223cUS$ 1150 in 2009. Affordability results showed that at the GAVI-subsidized vaccine price, rotavirus vaccination could be affordable for Vietnamese health system. Rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam would be a cost-effective health intervention. Vaccination only becomes affordable if the country receives GAVI's financial support due to the current high market vaccine price. Given the high mortality rate of under-five-year children, the results showed that rotavirus immunization is the \"best hope\" for prevention of rotavirus-related diarrhoeal disease in Vietnam. In the next five years, Vietnam is definitely in debt to financial support from international organizations in implementing rotavirus immunization.

Bovine rotavirus vaccines were nonreactogenic in infants, whereas RRV-based and M37 vaccines were occasionally associated with febrile reactions 2-5 days after vaccination. All vaccines showed dose-dependent immunogenicity. Vaccine efficacy correlated with overall immunogenicity but not with the vaccine virus G serotype. For each vaccine, protective efficacy was better against severe rotavirus disease than against any rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis. Maximal protective efficacy against any rotavirus gastroenteritis in subjects with demonstrable vaccine immunogenicity was approximately 75%.

We examined this risk in a population in the United States. Participants were infants between the ages of 4 and 34 weeks who were enrolled in six integrated health care organizations in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project. We reviewed medical records and visits for intussusception within 7 days after monovalent rotavirus vaccination from April 2008 through March 2013. Using sequential analyses, we then compared the risk of intussusception among children receiving monovalent rotavirus vaccine with historical background rates. We further compared the risk after monovalent rotavirus vaccination with the risk in a concurrent cohort of infants who received the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine. During the study period, 207,955 doses of monovalent rotavirus vaccine (including 115,908 first doses and 92,047 second doses) were administered in the VSD population. We identified 6 cases of intussusception within 7 days after the administration of either dose of vaccine. For the two doses combined, the expected number of intussusception cases was 0.72, resulting in a significant relative risk of 8.4. For the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, 1,301,810 doses were administered during the study period, with 8 observed intussusception cases (7.11 expected), for a nonsignificant relative risk of 1.1. The relative risk of chart-confirmed intussusception within 7 days after monovalent rotavirus vaccination, as compared with the risk after pentavalent rotavirus vaccination, was 9.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 103.8). The attributable risk of intussusception after the administration of two doses of monovalent rotavirus vaccine was estimated to be 5.3 per 100,000 infants vaccinated. In this prospective postlicensure study of more than 200,000 doses of monovalent rotavirus vaccine, we observed a significant increase in the rate of intussusception after vaccination, a risk that must be weighed against the benefits of preventing rotavirus-associated illness.

We reviewed published studies on rotavirus infection and genotype distribution in India, as well as safety and immunogenicity studies of currently available vaccines. PubMed was searched for papers published after 1990, and several authors who are experts in the field recommended papers of known significance. Rotavirus accounts for close to 40% of hospitalizations for diarrhea in India, with more recent studies showing an increased proportion compared with older studies. There is substantial serotype diversity in India, although there is less intra-country variation than previously thought. Two genotypes, G1P[8] and G2P[4], account for roughly 50% of symptomatic infections in non-neonates. Currently licensed vaccines are safe, and although the efficacy appears lower in developing countries, given the extremely high incidence of diarrhea these could still be cost-effective interventions. The epidemiology and burden of rotavirus diarrhea is fairly well characterized in India. Introducing rotavirus vaccine into the UIP, along with adequate surveillance, should be an important part of efforts to reduce diarrhea mortality, the third leading cause of death among Indian children, and achieve the country's MDG goals.",

Few data exist on the burden of rotavirus disease and its associated costs within the EU. To estimate the burden of rotavirus disease in the EU, we adapted a model based on the approach developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the European situation and applied it to recent population and mortality data from European countries. Country-specific estimates were added to obtain a global estimate of rotavirus episodes treated at home, clinic visits, hospitalization and death. We estimate that 3.6 million episodes of rotavirus disease occur annually among the 23.6 million children younger than 5 years of age in the EU. Every year, rotavirus accounts for 231 deaths, &gt;87,000 hospitalizations and almost 700,000 outpatient visits. Rotavirus disease constitutes a large public health burden in the EU. Except for deaths, the burden of disease is not dissimilar to that in the developing world.

With the recent introduction of the two rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, in many countries, it appears that the total number of hospitalizations due to rotavirus infections is being reduced, at least in developed countries that implemented a universal immunization program. However, continued surveillance is warranted, especially regarding the long-term effects of the vaccines. No data analyses are available to clarify whether rotavirus vaccine introduction would allow other rotavirus P and G genotypes, which are not covered by the current vaccines, to emerge into the human population and fill the apparent gap.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22431803": " With the recent postlicensure identification of an increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccine, the 14 Latin American countries currently using rotavirus vaccine must now weigh the health benefits versus risks to assess whether to continue vaccination. To inform policy considerations, we estimated excess intussusception cases and mortality potentially caused by rotavirus vaccine for each of the 14 countries and compared these estimates to hospitalizations and deaths expected to be averted through vaccination. We used regional rotavirus disease burden and rotavirus vaccine efficacy data, global natural intussusception and regional rotavirus vaccine-related risk estimates, and country-specific diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussus vaccination coverage rates to estimate rotavirus vaccine coverage rates. We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainty in these parameters. For an aggregate hypothetical birth cohort of 9.5 million infants in these 14 countries, rotavirus vaccine would annually prevent 144 746 (90% confidence interval [CI], 128 821-156 707) hospitalizations and 4124 deaths (90% CI, 3740-4239) due to rotavirus in their first 5 years of life but could cause an additional 172 hospitalizations (90% CI, 126-293) and 10 deaths (90% CI, 6-17) due to intussusception, yielding benefit-risk ratios for hospitalization and death of 841:1 (90% CI, 479:1 to 1142:1) and 395:1 (90% CI, 207:1 to 526:1), respectively. In an uncertainty analysis using 10 000 simulations of our probabilistic parameters, in comparing rotavirus disease averted to intussusception events caused, the hospitalization ratio was never below 100:1, and our death ratio fell below 100:1 only once. The health benefits of vaccination far outweigh the short-term risks and support continued rotavirus vaccination in Latin America.",

Both licensed rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix\u2122 [RV1] and RotaTeq\u2122 [RV5]) are effective and safe. Studies from countries that have included RV1 or RV5 in the national immunization programs have demonstrated their safety and sustained efficacy under real-life circumstances. A significant decline in acute gastroenteritis-related deaths among Latin American children was observed after the introduction of RV1 and RV5 vaccines. Both vaccines were able to decrease the number of cases of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis and of severe rotavirus diseases. Vaccination was also associated with a dramatic reduction in hospitalizations and outpatient visits for all-cause acute gastroenteritis.

The monovalent rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 (Rotarix\u2122) is administered as a two-dose oral series in infants and has demonstrated protective efficacy against RVGE in clinical trials conducted in developed countries. In addition, various naturalistic studies have demonstrated 'real-world' effectiveness after the introduction of widespread rotavirus vaccination programmes in the community setting. Numerous cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted in developed countries in which a universal rotavirus vaccination programme using RIX4414 was compared with no universal rotavirus vaccination programme. There was a high degree of variability in base-case results across studies even when conducted in the same country, often reflecting differences in the selection of data sources or assumptions used to populate the models. In addition, results were sensitive to plausible changes in a number of key input parameters. As such, it is not possible to definitively state whether a universal rotavirus vaccination programme with RIX4414 is cost effective in developed countries, although results of some analyses in some countries suggest this is the case. In addition, international guidelines advocate universal vaccination of infants and children against rotavirus. It is also difficult to draw conclusions regarding the cost effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 relative to that of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, which is administered as a three-dose oral series. Although indirect comparisons in cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that RIX4414 provided more favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios when each vaccine was compared with no universal rotavirus vaccination programme, results were generally sensitive to vaccine costs. Actual tender prices of a full vaccination course for each vaccine were not known at the time of the analyses and therefore had to be estimated.",

A live attenuated monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) containing human rotavirus strain RIX4414 of G1P1A P[8] specificity is being developed to meet the global need. An overview of RIX4414 trials in developed and developing settings is presented for 3 selected trials conducted in Finland (pilot study), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela) and Singapore involving 5024 infants.

There was no interference with immunogenicity of coadministered routine pediatric vaccines. Rotarix significantly reduced rotavirus gastroenteritis episodes and rotavirus-related hospitalizations in vaccinated infants compared with placebo recipients (P &lt; 0.05). Vaccine efficacy was observed against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1 and non-G1 types including the emerging G9 type (P &lt; 0.05) in Latin America.

A retrospective review of intussusception cases for children aged &lt;24 months old was undertaken between January 2007 and October 2012 pre-vaccine. All admissions and deaths with a discharge diagnosis of intussusception, bowel obstruction, paralytic ileus, or intussusception ICD10-AM codes were extracted from national databases and hospital records. Nationwide active intussusception surveillance was established for three years post-vaccine (2013-2015). There were 24 definite intussusception cases in the pre-rotavirus vaccine period, 96% were confirmed by surgery. The median age was 6.5 months. The incidence rate was 22.2 (95% CI: 13.9-33.7) per 100,000 infants. There were no deaths. Active surveillance identified 25 definite intussusception cases, 96% of which were among children who were age-eligible for rotavirus vaccine. None were potentially vaccine related. We estimated one to five additional cases of intussusception every five years. The incidence of intussusception pre-rotavirus vaccine in Fiji is low.

Efficacy studies of this vaccine in 6-12 month-old children gave results characteristic of the performance of oral rotavirus vaccines in general: 58% protective efficacy against any rotavirus gastroenteritis and 82% against \"clinically significant\" gastroenteritis. Four trials of RIT 4237 bovine rotavirus vaccine, one trial of group A RRV-1 rhesus rotavirus vaccine, and one trial of rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccines D x RRV and DS1 x RRV were carried out between 1983-1989.

There was no apparent difference between bovine and rhesus-based rotavirus vaccines in the protective efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Problems associated with the use of any oral rotavirus vaccine include acid lability of the vaccine virus, which requires buffering, and a slight but significant interference of oral poliovirus vaccine with the uptake of rotavirus vaccine.

Indirect effects of rotavirus vaccine (herd immunity and herd protection) could increase population level impact and improve vaccine cost effectiveness in such settings. While rotavirus vaccine indirect effects have been demonstrated in high and middle income countries, there are very little data from low income countries where force of infection, population structures and vaccine schedules differ.

Based on calculations using vaccine distribution data and intussusception incidence rates from 2 separate databases, an estimated 7 to 16 cases would have been expected to occur in the week after vaccination by chance alone. Using a passive surveillance system for vaccine adverse events, we observed at least a fourfold increase over the expected number of intussusception cases occurring within 1 week of receipt of rotavirus vaccine.

However, nearly all patients ultimately become refractory due to the development of docetaxel resistance. The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis including prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (<i>P</i> = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (<i>P</i> = 0.020). These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC.",

However, in most cases, they cannot readily cross the human blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Herein, we propose as a therapeutic for PD the small molecule 17-beta-spiro-[5-androsten-17,2'-oxiran]-3beta-ol (BNN-20), a synthetic analogue of DHEA, which crosses the BBB and is deprived of endocrine side-effects. Using the \"weaver\" mouse, a genetic model of PD, which exhibits progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the Substantia Nigra (SN), we have shown that long-term administration (P1-P21) of BNN-20 almost fully protected the dopaminergic neurons and their terminals, via i) a strong anti-apoptotic effect, probably mediated through the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) neurotrophin receptor's PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, ii) by exerting an efficient antioxidant effect, iii) by inducing significant anti-inflammatory activity and iv) by restoring Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels. By intercrossing \"weaver\" with NGL mice (dual GFP/luciferase-NF-\u03ba\u0392 reporter mice, NF-\u03ba\u0392.GFP.Luc), we obtained Weaver/NGL mice that express the NF-\u03baB reporter in all somatic cells. Acute BNN-20 administration to Weaver/NGL mice induced a strong NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional response in the brain as detected by bioluminescence imaging, which was abolished by co-administration of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. This indicates that BNN-20 exerts its beneficial action (at least in part) through the TrkB-PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These results could be of clinical relevance, as they suggest BNN-20 as an important neuroprotective agent acting through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor pathway, mimicking the action of the endogenous neurotrophin BDNF. Thus BNN-20 could be proposed for treatment of PD.",

Consistent with an observed caudal shift in Hox gene expression, segment identity is shifted anteriorly, such that Moz-deficient mice show a profound homeotic transformation of the axial skeleton and the nervous system. Intriguingly, histone acetylation defects are relatively specific to H3K9 at Hox loci, as neither Hox H3K14 acetylation nor bulk H3K9 acetylation levels throughout the genome are strongly affected; H4K16 acetylation actually increases in the absence of Moz. H3K9 hypoacetylation, Hox gene repression, and the homeotic transformation caused by lack of Moz are all reversed by treatment with retinoic acid (RA). In conclusion, our data show that Moz regulates H3K9 acetylation at Hox gene loci and that RA can act independently of Moz to establish specific Hox gene expression boundaries.",

Here we report novel insights into histone H3 tail structure in complex with the double PHD finger (DPF) of the lysine acetyltransferase MOZ/MYST3/KAT6A. In addition to sampling H3 and H4 modification status, we show that the DPF cooperates with the MYST domain to promote H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation, although not if H3K4 is trimethylated. Four crystal structures of an extended DPF alone and in complex with unmodified or acetylated forms of the H3 tail reveal the molecular basis of crosstalk between H3K4me3 and H3K14ac. We show for the first time that MOZ DPF induces \u03b1-helical conformation of H3K4-T11, revealing a unique mode of H3 recognition. The helical structure facilitates sampling of H3K4 methylation status, and proffers H3K9 and other residues for modification. Additionally, we show that a conserved double glycine hinge flanking the H3 tail helix is required for a conformational change enabling docking of H3K14ac with the DPF. In summary, our data provide the first observations of extensive helical structure in a histone tail, revealing the inherent ability of the H3 tail to adopt alternate conformations in complex with chromatin regulators.",

To understand the genetic basis of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) susceptibility, a complex and highly prevalent congenital malformation, we searched for genetic variants with a regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle [OOM]), of affected individuals. From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells. Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i.e., DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample. MRPL53 (2p13.1) encodes a 39S protein subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes and interacts with MYC, a transcription factor required for normal facial morphogenesis. Our study illustrates not only the importance of sampling admixed populations but also the relevance of measuring the functional effects of genetic variants over gene expression to dissect the complexity of disease phenotypes.",

PTEN pseudogene (PTENp) acts as an endogenous RNA, which regulates its parental gene by competitively binding to the 3' UTR of PTEN gene in the human. Despite the importance of this pseudogene, little is known about the molecular evolution of PTENp in mammals. In this study, we identified 37 pseudogenes from 65 mammalian genomes. Among them, 32 were from rodents or primates. Phylogenetic analyse showed a complex evolutionary history of this gene family. Some PTENps were shared both in primates and rodents. However, some PTENps were shown to be species-specific, such as the tasmanian devil PTENp1, nine banded armadillo PTENp1 and gibbon PTENp1. Most interestingly, the naked mole rat (NMR), an anticancer model organism, possessed 17 copies of PTENps, which were classified into four clades based on the phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, we found that all the 3'UTR of PTEN and PTENps shared common microRNA (MicroRNA) binding sites in NMR, based on our prediction of specific MicroRNA binding sites. Our findings suggested that multiple gene duplications have occurred in the formation of PTEN/PTENp gene family during the evolution of mammals. Some PTENps were relatively ancient and were shared by primates and rodents; others were newly originated through species- specific gene duplications. PTENps in NMR may function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate their counterpart genes by competing for common MicroRNAs, which may be one of the interpretations for the cancer resistance in NMR.",

Patients with a corticosteroid-refractory flare of UC who did not respond to calcineurin inhibitors and received continuing salvage therapy with adalimumab were included in this retrospective, observational, single-centre study. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical remission and response were evaluated based on the Rachmilewitz index. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated. Predictive factors for clinical remission and colectomy were identified. In the safety evaluation, any adverse event occurring after the administration of adalimumab was considered.

This study aimed to assess which of the endoscopic indices used to evaluate mucosal changes in UC are correlated with clinical indices currently used to determine disease activity, as well as which of the endoscopic indices are correlated with the Geboes Index used for histological evaluation. It also aimed to find correlations between the currently used clinical activity indices and the histological Geboes Index. A group of 49 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of UC and a group of 52 individuals without a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, who constituted the control group, were investigated. All patients were evaluated by colonoscopy, and the severity of mucosal changes was scored in terms of nine different endoscopic indices commonly used in both pharmacological trials and clinical practice. Evaluation was also carried out using clinical and histological indices. Endoscopic indices used for UC were then correlated with different clinical and histological indices to find the strongest correlations. A high correlation was demonstrated between three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index. Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores was the index with the highest correlation with all the endoscopic indices used for UC.

Colon biopsies were obtained from each affected anatomical site. Severity of inflammation was assessed by eosin/hematoxylin. Constitutive (HSP70c) and inducible (HSP70i) HSP70 expression were immunohistochemically studied. 29 UC patients were enrolled (69% men). Mean age was 46.5 years (SD: 19.5). Inflammation severity was moderate in 17 patients, severe in 6, and mild in 6. The mean number of years since diagnosis was 7.9 (SD: 6.5). The mean CAI was 6.4 (SD: 3.1). In active UC, there was downregulation of HSP70c in inflamed epithelium, without significant HSP70 induction. In 22/29 cases of active cryptitis, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) clearly expressed HSP70i, with weak, focal positivity in the other 7 cases.

Logistic regression showed a strong positive relationship between HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN cells and scores in the trait anxiety, ZDRS, and hospital depression scales, (Odds ratios 1.3, 1.3, and 1.5; P = 0.018, 0.023, and 0.038; Wald test, 5.6, 5.2, and 4.3 respectively) and a weaker but significant positive correlation with the CAI (Odds ratio 1.654; P = 0.049; Wald test 3.858). HSP70 is induced in PMN cells of UC patients and its induction correlates with depression and anxiety levels.",

We performed a prospective head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of both fecal calprotectin (fCal) and neopterin (fNeo), and serum C-reactive protein in predicting endoscopic disease severity in patients with IBD. A total of 133 consecutive patients with IBD (78 Crohn's disease [CD] and 55 ulcerative colitis [UC]) undergoing a colonoscopy provided fecal samples for the measurement of fCal and fNeo concentrations and a blood sample for the serum C-reactive protein measurement. Endoscopic disease activities were scored independently according to the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD in patients with CD and to the Rachmilewitz Index in patients with UC. The respective performances of the fecal markers with respect to endoscopic disease severity were assessed by computing correlations, sensitivities, specificities, and overall accuracies at adjusted cutoffs and also test operating characteristics. The fCal and fNeo concentrations differed significantly in clinically and endoscopically active IBD when compared with those in patients with inactive disease. Both fCal and fNeo concentrations correlated closer with endoscopic scores in UC (r = 0.75 and r = 0.72, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001 for both) than in CD (r = 0.53 and r = 0.47, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001 for both). Using cutoffs of 250 \u03bcg/g for fCal and 200 pmol/g for fNeo, both fecal markers had similar overall accuracies to predict endoscopic activity in patients with CD (74%) and also a higher and similar accuracies (88% and 90%, respectively) in patients with UC, whereas accuracies of C-reactive protein were slightly lower in patients with CD and UC. The fNeo is a novel reliable surrogate biomarker with the potential to identify patients with IBD with active mucosal lesions and represents an alternative marker as accurate as fCal to predict and monitor the severity of mucosal damages in patients with IBD.",

Three groups of patients with chronic continuous or chronic recurrent ulcerative colitis (UC) were formed according to the treatment option: 1) 15 patients with UC, in whom mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were thrice administered for a month at a one-week interval; 2) 20 patients with UC who received MSC once; 3) 20 patients with UC who had standard anti-inflammatory therapy with 5-aminosalycilic acid (5-ASA) preparations and glucocorticosteroids (GCS). The clinical activity of UC was evaluated using the Rachmilewitz index; its endoscopic pattern was assessed with the Mayo index. UC histological specimens were scored using the Gebs scale. To ascertain the duration of remission, the authors used the Kaplan-Maier survival curve method and calculated relative risk (RR) and odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Following 12 months, allogeneic bone marrow (BM) MSC transplantation performed thrice during a month caused the greatest reduction in the Rachmilewitz clinical activity index, Mayo endoscopic activity index, and Gebs pathohistological index in patients with UC as compared to those who had underwent one transplantation or received 5-ASA preparations and GCS (p &lt; 0.05). The duration of remission also depended on the chosen therapy option for UC and the frequency of cell culture administration: the longer duration was recorded in patients who were infused thrice with allogeneic BM MSC. In the patients who had undergone one MSC administration, the risk of recurrent UC was higher than in those who had received MSC thrice during a month (a 2-year follow-up) and comparable with the RR of recurrent UC in the patient receiving only 5-ASA preparations, GCS, and/or immunosuppressants.",

This study included 109 patients with UC. Based on the disease extent, patients were divided into two groups as left-sided colitis and pancolitis. Patients were grouped as inactive, mild, moderate and severe depending on the Rachmilewitz EAI and Harpaz HSS. Kendal's tau and kappa (x03BA;) statistics were used to assess the agreement between endoscopic and histopathological scores. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was also analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic scores to predict inactive histopathological disease. In the left-sided colitis group, there were slight and poor agreements in the inactive endoscopic subscores (ESS) with inactive Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.598, p &lt; 0.001) and moderate ESS with moderate Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.236, p = 0.046).

It includes cases with diverse clinical manifestations, range and histopathological picture. New methods to distinguish inflammatory bowel diseases, chose proper treatment and monitor their activity are searched. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (pANCA) seem to be a new markers used in this end. Comparison of ASCA and pANCA appearance in CD and UC searching of correlation between serum levels of antibodies, activity and clinical picture of disease and appearance of ASCA and pANCA in IC. We examined 63 patients with UC aged 24 to 74 (30 men and 33 women), 14 patients with CD aged 27 to 64 (10 men and 4 women) and 11 patients with IC aged 21 to 53 (4 men and 7 women). Mean duration time of diseases respectively for UC, CD and IC was 7.9 (from 1.0 to 32), 9 (from 1 to 20) and 3.04 (0.5 to 7) years. Diagnosis in specific clinical picture was established with endoscopic and histopathologic examination. Disease activity was described according to Rachmilewitz scale in UC and in CD according to Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI). Control group consisted of 24 healthy men.

UC patients undergoing colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled and scored independently according the endoscopic and clinical part of the Rachmilewitz Index. Patients and controls provided fecal and blood samples for measuring calprotectin, CRP, and leukocytes. Values in UC patients (n = 134) compared to controls (n = 48): calprotectin: 396 \u00b1 351 versus 18.1 \u00b1 5 \u03bcg/g, CRP 16 \u00b1 13 versus 3 \u00b1 2 mg/L, blood leukocytes 9.9 \u00b1 3.5 versus 5.4 \u00b1 1.9 g/L (all P &lt; 0.001).

Chron's disease patients with a Chron's disease activity index &gt;150 and ulcerative colitis patients with a Rachmilewitz index &gt; or =4 were accepted to have active disease. Determination of transforming growth factor-B1 level was performed with the enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay. Serum transforming growth factor-B1 levels were measured as: Chron's disease 1133.3+/-766.5 pg/ml, ulcerative colitis 1362.5+/-880.6 pg/ml and control group 1230.0+/-572.7 pg/ml. There were no significant differences between the three groups. In patients with active disease in ulcerative colitis, transforming growth factor-B1 level was measured as 1952.5+/-543.7, while this value was 772.5+/-750.5 in patientsin remission in ulcerative colitis. There was a significant difference between patients with active ulcerative colitis and remission ulcerative colitis.

In stepwise regression model; it was identified that IMA(OR = 1.496; P = 0.016) and CRP(OR = 3.457; P = 0.015) are predictors of IBD in comparison with the control group. In linear regression model, it was identified that risk factors such as log(IMA) and log(CRP) were independent predictors of log(CDAI) and log(EAI) levels. This is the first study showing that IMA levels in IBD were determined higher in comparison with the control group. Moreover, IMA being a predictor for IBD and being positively correlated with disease activity indexes were determined for the first time in the study. In accordance with these results, it is possible to say that IMA in IBD might be related with the pathogenesis of disease and correlated with the severity of the disease.",

Eligible patients included stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, stage I central non-small cell lung cancer, or limited-stage small cell. Patients who met eligibility for randomization at the end of radiotherapy received either captopril or standard care for 1 year. The captopril was to be escalated to 50 mg three times a day. Primary endpoint was incidence of grade 2+ radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity in the first year. Eighty-one patients were accrued between June 2003 and August 2007. Given the low accrual rate, the study was closed early. No significant safety issues were encountered. Eight patients were ineligible for registration or withdrew consent before randomization and 40 patients were not randomized postradiation. Major reasons for nonrandomization included patients' refusal and physician preference. Of the 33 randomized patients, 20 were analyzable (13 observation, 7 captopril). The incidence of grade 2+ pulmonary toxicity attributable to radiation therapy was 23% (3/13) in the observation arm and 14% (1/7) in the captopril arm. Despite significant resources and multiple amendments, NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0123 was unable to test the hypothesis that captopril mitigates radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity. It did show the safety of such an approach and the use of newer angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors started during radiotherapy may solve the accrual problems.",

We collected 2 types of social media data: (1) a total of 3711 blogs tagged with \"diabetes\" on Tumblr posted between February and October 2015; and (2) a total of 58,422 questions and associated answers posted between 2009 and 2014 in the diabetes category of Yahoo! Answers. We analyzed the datasets using a widely adopted biomedical text processing framework Apache cTAKES and its extension YTEX. First, we applied the named entity recognition (NER) method implemented in YTEX to identify UMLS concepts in the datasets. We then analyzed the coverage and the popularity of concepts in the UMLS source vocabularies across the 2 datasets (ie, blogs and social Q&amp;A). Further, we conducted a concept-level comparative coverage analysis between SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Open-Access Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV)-the top 2 UMLS source vocabularies that have the most coverage on our datasets. We also analyzed the UMLS semantic types that were frequently observed in our datasets. We identified 2415 UMLS concepts from blog postings, 6452 UMLS concepts from social Q&amp;A questions, and 10,378 UMLS concepts from the answers. The medical concepts identified in the blogs can be covered by 56 source vocabularies in the UMLS, while those in questions and answers can be covered by 58 source vocabularies. SNOMED CT was the dominant vocabulary in terms of coverage across all the datasets, ranging from 84.9% to 95.9%. It was followed by OAC CHV (between 73.5% and 80.0%) and Metathesaurus Names (MTH) (between 55.7% and 73.5%). All of the social media datasets shared frequent semantic types such as \"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein,\" \"Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component,\" and \"Disease or Syndrome.\" Although the 3 social media datasets vary greatly in size, they exhibited similar conceptual coverage among UMLS source vocabularies and the identified concepts showed similar semantic type distributions. As such, concepts that are both frequently used by consumers and also found in professional vocabularies such as SNOMED CT can be suggested to OAC CHV to improve its coverage.",

The Open Access and Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV), which contains health-related terms used by lay consumers, has been created to bridge such a gap. Specifically, the OAC CHV facilitates consumers' health information retrieval by enabling consumer-facing health applications to translate between professional language and consumer friendly language. To keep up with the constantly evolving medical knowledge and language use, new terms need to be identified and added to the OAC CHV. User-generated content on social media, including social question and answer (social Q&amp;A) sites, afford us an enormous opportunity in mining consumer health terms. Existing methods of identifying new consumer terms from text typically use ad-hoc lexical syntactic patterns and human review. Our study extends an existing method by extracting n-grams from a social Q&amp;A textual corpus and representing them with a rich set of contextual and syntactic features. Using K-means clustering, our method, simiTerm, was able to identify terms that are both contextually and syntactically similar to the existing OAC CHV terms.

Pedigree analysis and twin studies suggest that genetic components are part of the etiology, rather than only being risk factors for AD. The first autosomal dominant mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene was described in 1991. Later, AD was also associated with mutated early-onset (presenilin 1/2, PSEN1/2 and APP) and late-onset (apolipoprotein E, ApoE) genes.

RS is characterized by fatal bone marrow failure, exudative retinopathy, neuroradiographic abnormalities, neurodevelopmental delay and skin abnormalities. Non-treated exudative retinopathy leads to blindness. We report ophthalmological findings as follows: fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA) acquired by examinations under general anesthesia in patient with RS. Results of genetic tests helped to establish the diagnosis. Two\u2011year old Caucasian male was examined due to total retinal detachment on LE and signs of chorioretinal scarring on RE. In preoperative screening, thrombocytopenia was detected; later, severe pancytopenia developed. Considering the hematological findings and clinical appearance, we suspected RS, which was confirmed by genetic tests. We found a pathogenic mutation in gene TINF2 (variant c.865C&gt;T;p.Pro289Ser) in a mosaic state with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. This mutation has not been described in RS yet. Blind LE was enucleated because of dolorous neovascular glaucoma. FA of RE shows excessive areas of capillary nonperfusion with vascular abnormalities and exudation. After the photocoagulation, the visual acuity (VA) on RE remains 0.9 at the age of 7 years. RS is an extremely rare condition. The initial symptomatology could be ophthalmological or hematological. The positive finding of TINF2 gene mutation helped in establishing the correct diagnosis. The ischemic retinopathy was successfully treated by photocoagulation (Fig. 6, Ref. 6).

These findings were attributed to trauma and hemophilia A. Routine blood work for hemophilia A subsequently showed pancytopenia. A bone marrow aspirate showed marked hypocellularity consistent with severe aplastic anemia, and telomere testing revealed very short telomeres. The patient was found to have a TINF2 mutation consistent with a diagnosis of Revesz syndrome, a variant of dyskeratosis congenita. He underwent successful bone marrow transplantation, and on subsequent evaluation was found to have retinal hemorrhages, vessel sclerosis, and cotton wool spots in the right eye associated with peripheral retinal nonperfusion. He underwent retinal laser treatment to the areas of retinal nonperfusion which resulted in stable visual function.",

These \"telomeropathies\" also include Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH) and Revesz syndrome, which are severe forms of dyskeratosis congenita, as well as a subset of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, aplastic anemia, and Coats' plus syndrome. Retinopathy has only rarely been reported in DC and HH, but is universally present in Coats' plus and Revesz syndromes. The care of these patients is typically a multidisciplinary effort, and this should include monitoring by an ophthalmologist.",

Revesz syndrome, a subtype of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) caused by TINF2 mutation, combines marrow failure with exudative retinopathy, intracranial calcifications, and neurocognitive impairment. As our patients manifested neither intracranial calcification nor significant neurocognitive impairment, we conclude that the c.2603A&gt;G TERT mutation may define a subtype of DC manifesting first as exudative retinopathy without other signs of DC. Children with exudative retinopathy should be periodically screened for macrocytosis and cytopenias to evaluate for underlying DC.",

In patients with dyskeratosis-related syndromes, non-neoplastic parenchymal brain lesions occur and gliosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis for progressive enhancing brain lesions.

We report the ophthalmologic findings, documented by examinations under anesthesia with clinical photography and fluorescein angiography, as well as the systemic manifestations and genetic and molecular testing, in identical twins with Revesz syndrome, and compare and contrast these features to those of other pediatric retinal vasculopathies. Both twins exhibited widespread avascularity and anomalous vasculature of the retinal periphery, retinal telangiectasias, and exudation. One twin developed a combination exudative/tractional/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, while the other exhibited a focal collection of buds of retinal neovascularization. Both twins developed bone marrow failure and were found to have cerebellar hypoplasia and widespread cerebral calcifications. Telomere testing in lymphocytes and granulocytes revealed telomere length less than the 1st percentile for age, and gene sequencing revealed a novel mutation in the TINF2 gene, resulting in the T284P TIN2 protein variant. We report ophthalmic findings in twins with Revesz syndrome due to a previously unreported mutation in TINF2 and propose that phenotypic and molecular overlaps between DKC spectrum disorders and pediatric retinal vasculopathies may reflect a shared pathophysiologic basis.",

BNN27 is a novel 17C spiroepoxy-DHEA derivative, which devoid of steroidogenic activity. The neuroprotective effects of BNN27 have been recently reported. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of BNN27 on recognition memory in rats. For this purpose, the novel object task (NOT), a procedure assessing non-spatial recognition memory and the novel location task (NLT), a procedure evaluating spatial recognition memory were used. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg) antagonized delay-dependent deficits in the NOT in the normal rat, suggesting that this DHEA derivative affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. In addition, BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted the scopolamine [0.2mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)]-induced non-spatial and spatial recognition memory deficits. These findings suggest that BNN27 may modulate different aspects of recognition memory, potentially interacting with the cholinergic system, relevant to cognition.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874668": "Developmental genes in metazoan genomes are surrounded by dense clusters of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs exhibit unexplained extreme levels of sequence conservation, with many acting as developmental long-range enhancers. Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Their function and distribution around important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to 3D conformation of these loci. Here, we show that clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements. Here, the authors provide evidence that these clusters coincide with distinct topologically associating domains in humans and Drosophila, revealing a conserved regulatory genomic architecture.",

Her condition deteriorated due to acute hydrocephalus in the following days. In this article, we discuss the clinical presentation, imaging, treatment, and prognosis of our patient and the other 22 patients of primary intradural MPNST, found in the literature.

The authors report their experience with 1 new case of a primary MPNST. A 33-year-old woman presented with low-back pain radiating to the right calf that progressed over 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed an intradural extramedullary lesion at the T12-L1 level. The patient was diagnosed with primary MPNST, underwent two surgical excisions and radiation therapy, and developed leptomeningeal metastases as well as brain metastases. The patient revisited the emergency room with sudden loss of consciousness. A brain CT scan displayed bilateral lateral ventricle enlargement, for which a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted. These symptoms have not been described in any previous report. Primary spinal MPNST is an exceedingly rare entity, and the overall prognosis is very poor. To the authors' knowledge, no standard of care for primary spinal MPNSTs has yet been established.

Healthy BCG-vaccinated volunteers were vaccinated with either 1\u00d710(7) or 1\u00d710(8)PFU of MVA85A. All adverse events were documented and antigen specific T cell responses were measured using an ex vivo IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. Safety and immunogenicity were compared between the 2 dose groups and with a previous trial in which a dose of 5\u00d710(7)PFU MVA85A had been administered. There were no serious adverse events recorded following administration of either 1\u00d710(7) or 1\u00d710(8)PFU of MVA85A. Systemic adverse events were more frequently reported following administration of 1\u00d710(8)PFU of MVA85A when compared to either 5\u00d710(7) or 1\u00d710(7)PFU of MVA85A but were mild or moderate in severity and resolved completely within 7 days of immunisation. Antigen specific T cell responses as measured by the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT were significantly higher following immunisation in adults receiving 1\u00d710(8)PFU compared to the 5\u00d710(7) and 1\u00d710(7) doses. Additionally, a broader range of Ag85A epitopes are detected following 1\u00d710(8)PFU of MVA85A. A higher dose of 1\u00d710(8)PFU of MVA85A is well-tolerated, increases the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells detected following immunisation and broadens the range of Ag85A epitopes detected.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726088": " HIV-1 infection is associated with increased risk of tuberculosis and a safe and effective vaccine would assist control measures. We assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a candidate tuberculosis vaccine, modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A), in adults infected with HIV-1. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of MVA85A in adults infected with HIV-1, at two clinical sites, in Cape Town, South Africa and Dakar, Senegal. Eligible participants were aged 18-50 years, had no evidence of active tuberculosis, and had baseline CD4 counts greater than 350 cells per \u03bcL if they had never received antiretroviral therapy or greater than 300 cells per \u03bcL (and with undetectable viral load before randomisation) if they were receiving antiretroviral therapy; participants with latent tuberculosis infection were eligible if they had completed at least 5 months of isoniazid preventive therapy, unless they had completed treatment for tuberculosis disease within 3 years before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four by randomly generated sequence to receive two intradermal injections of either MVA85A or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by antiretroviral therapy status and study site. Participants, nurses, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to group allocation. The second (booster) injection of MVA85A or placebo was given 6-12 months after the first vaccination. The primary study outcome was safety in all vaccinated participants (the safety analysis population). Safety was assessed throughout the trial as defined in the protocol. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease, assessed in the per-protocol population. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of participants at day 7 and day 28 after the first and second vaccination, and M tuberculosis infection and disease were assessed at the end of the study. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01151189\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01151189</a>. Between Aug 4, 2011, and April 24, 2013, 650 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned; 649 were included in the safety analysis (324 in the MVA85A group and 325 in the placebo group) and 645 in the per-protocol analysis (320 and 325). 513 (71%) participants had CD4 counts greater than 300 cells per \u03bcL and were receiving antiretroviral therapy; 136 (21%) had CD4 counts above 350 cells per \u03bcL and had never received antiretroviral therapy. 277 (43%) had received isoniazid prophylaxis before enrolment. Solicited adverse events were more frequent in participants who received MVA85A (288 [89%]) than in those given placebo (235 [72%]). 34 serious adverse events were reported, 17 (5%) in each group. MVA85A induced a significant increase in antigen 85A-specific T-cell response, which peaked 7 days after both vaccinations and was primarily monofunctional. The number of participants with negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube findings at baseline who converted to positive by the end of the study was 38 (20%) of 186 in the MVA85A group and 40 (23%) of 173 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 11\u00b77% (95% CI -41\u00b73 to 44\u00b79). In the per-protocol population, six (2%) cases of tuberculosis disease occurred in the MVA85A group and nine (3%) occurred in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 32\u00b78% (95% CI -111\u00b75 to 80\u00b73). MVA85A was well tolerated and immunogenic in adults infected with HIV-1. However, we detected no efficacy against M tuberculosis infection or disease, although the study was underpowered to detect an effect against disease. Potential reasons for the absence of detectable efficacy in this trial include insufficient induction of a vaccine-induced immune response or the wrong type of vaccine-induced immune response, or both.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330447": "The nuclear receptor Farnesoid x receptor (FXR) is a critical regulator of multiple genes involved in bile acid homeostasis. The coactivators attracted to promoters of FXR target genes and epigenetic modifications that occur after ligand binding to FXR have not been completely defined, and it is unknown whether these processes are disrupted during cholestasis. Using a microarray, we identified decreased expression of mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) lysine methyl transferase at 1 and 3 days of post-common bile duct ligation (CBDL) in mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) analysis revealed that H3K4me3 of transporter promoters by MLL3 as part of activating signal cointegrator-2 -containing complex (ASCOM) is essential for activation of bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2), and sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) genes by FXR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Knockdown of nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) or MLL3/MLL4 mRNAs by small interfering RNA treatment led to a decrease in BSEP and NTCP mRNA levels in hepatoma cells. Human BSEP promoter transactivation by FXR/RXR was enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by NCOA6 cDNA coexpression and decreased by AdsiNCOA6 infection in HepG2 cells. GST-pull down assays showed that domain 3 and 5 of NCOA6 (LXXLL motifs) interacted with FXR and that the interaction with domain 5 was enhanced by chenodeoxycholic acid. In vivo ChIP assays in HepG2 cells revealed ligand-dependent recruitment of ASCOM complex to FXR element in BSEP and GR element in NTCP promoters, respectively. ChIP analysis demonstrated significantly diminished recruitment of ASCOM complex components and H3K4me3 to Bsep and Mrp2 promoter FXR elements in mouse livers after CBDL. Taken together, these data show that the \"H3K4me3\" epigenetic mark is essential to activation of BSEP, NTCP, and MRP2 genes by nuclear receptors and is downregulated in cholestasis."
