Master regulator analysis identifies ZCCHC17 as normally supporting the expression of a network of synaptic genes, and predicts that ZCCHC17 dysfunction in AD leads to lower expression of these genes. We demonstrate that ZCCHC17 is normally expressed in neurons and is reduced early in the course of AD pathology. We show that ZCCHC17 loss in rat neurons leads to lower expression of the majority of the predicted synaptic targets and that ZCCHC17 drives the expression of a similar gene network in humans and rats. These findings support a conserved function for ZCCHC17 between species and identify ZCCHC17 loss as an important early driver of lower synaptic gene expression in AD.

Here we have implemented a novel meta-analysis approach to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in published datasets comprising 450 late onset AD (LOAD) brains and 212 controls. We found 3124 DEGs, many of which were highly correlated with Braak stage and cerebral atrophy. Pathway Analysis revealed the most perturbed pathways to be (a) nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages (NOROS), (b) NFkB and (c) mitochondrial dysfunction. NOROS was also up-regulated, and mitochondrial dysfunction down-regulated, in healthy ageing subjects. Upstream regulator analysis predicted the TLR4 ligands, STAT3 and NFKBIA, for activated pathways and RICTOR for mitochondrial genes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis emphasised the role of NFKB; identified a key interaction of CLU with complement; and linked TYROBP, TREM2 and DOK3 to modulation of LPS signalling through TLR4 and to phosphatidylinositol metabolism. We suggest that NEUROD6, ZCCHC17, PPEF1 and MANBAL are potentially implicated in LOAD, with predicted links to calcium signalling and protein mannosylation. Our study demonstrates a highly injurious combination of TLR4-mediated NFKB signalling, NOROS inflammatory pathway activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in LOAD.",

ADP-ribosylation is a PTM, in which ADP-ribosyltransferases use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) to modify target proteins with ADP-ribose. This modification can occur as mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation. The latter involves the synthesis of long ADP-ribose chains that have specific properties due to the nature of the polymer. ADP-Ribosylation is reversed by hydrolases that cleave the glycosidic bonds either between ADP-ribose units or between the protein proximal ADP-ribose and a given amino acid side chain. Here we discuss the properties of the different enzymes associated with ADP-ribosylation and the consequences of this PTM on substrates. Furthermore, the different domains that interpret either mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation and the implications for cellular processes are described.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29327913": "Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that is critically involved in many biological processes that are linked to cell stress responses. It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification. In this Perspective, we discuss these breakthroughs, including their technical development, and applications that provide a global view of the many biological processes regulated by this important protein modification.",

To date, a complete understanding of ADP-ribosylation targets and their modification sites in different tissues and disease states is still lacking. Identification of ADP-ribosylation sites is required to discern the molecular mechanisms regulated by this modification. This motivated us to develop a computational tool for the prediction of ADP-ribosylated sites. Here, we present ADPredict, the first dedicated computational tool for the prediction of ADP-ribosylated aspartic and glutamic acids. This predictive algorithm is based on (i) physicochemical properties, (ii) in-house designed secondary structure-related descriptors and (iii) three-dimensional features of a set of human ADP-ribosylated proteins that have been reported in the literature. ADPredict was developed using principal component analysis and machine learning techniques; its performance was evaluated both internally via intensive bootstrapping and in predicting two external experimental datasets. It outperformed the only other available ADP-ribosylation prediction tool, ModPred. Moreover, a novel secondary structure descriptor, HM-ratio, was introduced and successfully contributed to the model development, thus representing a promising tool for bioinformatics studies, such as PTM prediction.

However, the use of saline-based HES may lead to hyperchloremia. This study aimed to clarify the effects of saline-based HES on umbilical cord chloride level at delivery. We retrospectively analyzed 93 consecutive single-pregnancy patients who underwent cesarean section with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The patients were divided into two groups, depending on the use of 6% HES 130/0.4: group A (461 \u00b1 167 ml of saline-based HES was administered; 43 patients) and group B (HES not administered; 50 patients). The major outcome was umbilical cord chloride level at delivery. The volume infused from operating room admission until delivery was not significantly different between groups. The umbilical cord chloride level at delivery was statistically significantly higher in group A than in group B, but clinically similar (108 \u00b1 2 vs. 107 \u00b1 2 mmol/l, P = 0.02). No differences were observed in the Apgar score or other umbilical cord laboratory data at delivery (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, pH, base excess). In conclusion, we suggest that although the use of up to 500 ml of saline-based HES during cesarean section influences umbilical cord blood electrolytes, the effect is not of a clinically significant magnitude.",

However, opioids are not devoid of side effects. The aim of this study was to compare the side effects of subarachnoid sufentanil associated with bupivacaine to those caused by epidural sufentanil associated with ropivacaine in the doses used in the Anesthesiology Department in pregnant women undergoing labor analgesia. Sixty pregnant women, ASA physical status I and II, ages between 15 and 42 years, at term and with healthy fetuses, undergoing labor analgesia were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided in two groups: G1 - combined spinal epidural anesthesia - 0.5% bupivacaine (2.5 mg) and subarachnoid sufentanil (5 microg); G2 - Epidural Block - 0.2% ropivacaine (20 mg), and epidural sufentanil (10 microg). Complementary doses of 0.2% ropivacaine (12 mg) were administered whenever necessary, and 1% ropivacaine (50 mg) was administered for labor resolution. Patients were evaluated after analgesia (M1) regarding the presence of hypotension, maternal bradycardia, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and sedation. They were also evaluated postoperatively (M2) regarding the presence of nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, urinary retention, and pain. Newborns were evaluated by the Apgar score. The test t Student, Mann-Whitney test, and Chi-Square test were used for the statistical analysis. Both groups were similar regarding age, weight, height, duration of labor after analgesia, Apgar score of the newborns, hypotension, maternal bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention. Sedation was more frequent in patients in G2 at M1 (50%), which was statistically significant. Subarachnoid or epidural sufentanil, in the doses used in this study, associated with local anesthetics, had the same effect on the duration of labor after analgesia and in the Apgar score of newborns. Sedation was the most frequent side effect in patients receiving epidural sufentanil.",

Recent investigations have demonstrated functional adrenoreceptors on the cellular mediators of cutaneous wound healing and NE-induced phenotypic alterations in immune cells have been demonstrated in vitro. Despite this, there is little description of how NE might alter the phases of wound healing in vivo. The purpose of this study was to compare cutaneous wound healing in norepinephrine-intact and norepinephrine-depleted mice. Norepinephrine-depleted (NED) mice were generated by chemical axotomy with 6-hydroxydopamine and compared with norepinephrine-intact (NEI) animals (n = 6-12 per group, per time point). Using an excisional wound model, neutrophil recruitment was measured by myeloperoxidase assay. Macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis were measured by immunohistochemistry and re-epithelialization was determined histologically. The development of incisional wound disruption strength was determined over time. Finally, macrophage scavenger function was assessed by an in vitro latex bead phagocytosis assay. Wounds from NEI mice demonstrated greater neutrophil infiltration than NED wounds (24, 72 hours; p &lt; 0.05). Wound macrophage recruitment was initially higher in NEI animals (24 hours, p &lt; 0.05), but was eventually surpassed by that of NED animals (120 hours, p &lt; 0.05). Angiogenesis was decreased while re-epithelialization was accelerated in NEI animals (p &lt; 0.05). Wound disruption strength and macrophage scavenger function were unaltered between NED and NEI mice. Norepinephrine modulates the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing in a temporally defined, cell-specific manner. By increasing recruitment of innate immune cells and expediting wound closure, norepinephrine appears to play a protective role in defense against infection.",

Mice with genetic deletions of scavenger receptors, such as SR-A and MARCO, are susceptible to infection or inflammation from inhaled pathogens or dusts. However, the signaling pathways required for scavenger receptor-mediated phagocytosis of unopsonized particles have not been characterized. We developed a scanning cytometry-based high-throughput assay of macrophage phagocytosis that quantitates bound and internalized unopsonized latex beads. This assay allowed the testing of a panel of signaling inhibitors which have previously been shown to target opsonin-dependent phagocytosis for their effect on unopsonized bead uptake by human in vitro-derived alveolar macrophage-like cells. The non-selective scavenger receptor inhibitor poly(I) and the actin destabilizer cytochalasin D were used to validate the assay and caused near complete abrogation of bead binding and internalization, respectively. Microtubule destabilization using nocodazole dramatically inhibited bead internalization. Internalization was also significantly reduced by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (genistein and herbimycin A), protein kinase C (staurosporine, chelerythrine chloride and G\u00f6 6976), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (LY294002 and wortmannin), and the JNK and ERK pathways. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C by U-73122 had no effect. These data indicate the utility of scanning cytometry for the analysis of phagocytosis and that phagocytosis of unopsonized particles has both shared and distinct features when compared to opsonin-mediated phagocytosis.",

The technique allows rapid analysis of large numbers of samples, and requires only a small sample volume. Comparison of plate types demonstrated that opaque white 96-well luminostrips produced a 100 fold greater fluorescent output, and were more sensitive than black fluoroplates. Intraplate variability was also significantly lower using white luminostrips. For the phagocytic assay, fluorescein conjugated polystyrene beads were incubated with macrophage monolayers in white luminostrips. After incubation, cells were washed, lysed and phagocytosis quantified by determining the fluorescent intensity using a fluorescence plate reader. The number of beads phagocytized was determined from a standard curve of bead number versus fluorescent output.

Knockout (KO) of Gpx1 decreases Gpx1 activity to near zero and substantially reduces liver selenium (Se) levels, but has no overt effects in otherwise healthy mice. To investigate the impact of deletion of Gpx1 on Se metabolism, Se flux, and apparent Se requirements, KO, Gpx1 heterozygous (Het), and Gpx1 wild-type (WT) mice were fed Se-deficient diet for 17 weeks, then repleted with graded levels of Se (0-0.3 \u03bcg Se/g as Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>) for 7 days, and selenoprotein activities and transcripts were determined in blood, liver, and kidney. Se deficiency decreased the activities of plasma Gpx3, liver Gpx1, liver Txnrd, and liver Gpx4 to 3, 0.3, 11, and 50% of WT Se-adequate levels, respectively, but the Gpx1 genotype had no effect on growth or changes in activity or expression of selenoproteins other than Gpx1. Se repletion increased selenoprotein transcripts to Se-adequate levels after 7 days; Se response curves and apparent Se requirements for selenoprotein transcripts were similar to those observed in studies starting with Se-adequate mice. With short-term Se repletion, selenoenzyme activities resulted in three Se response curve patterns: (1) liver and kidney Gpx1, Gpx4, and Txnrd activities were sigmoidal or hyperbolic with breakpoints (0.08-0.19 \u03bcg Se/g) that were double those observed in studies starting with Se-adequate mice; (2) red blood cell Gpx1 activity was not significantly changed; and (3) plasma Gpx3 activity only increased substantially with 0.3 \u03bcg Se/g. Plasma Gpx3 is secreted from kidney. In this short-term study, kidney Gpx3 mRNA reached plateau levels at 0.1 \u03bcg Se/g, and other kidney selenoenzyme activities reached plateau levels at \u2264 0.2 \u03bcg Se/g, so sufficient Se should have been present in kidney. Thus, the delayed increase in plasma Gpx3 activity suggests that newly synthesized and secreted kidney Gpx3 is preferentially retained in kidney or rapidly cleared by binding to basement membranes in kidney or in other tissues. This repletion study shows that loss of capacity to incorporate Se into Gpx1 in Gpx1 KO mice does not dramatically alter expression of other Se biomarkers, nor the short-term flux of Se from intestine to liver to kidney.",

Recently, the cytosolic form of Gpx4 was identified as an upstream regulator of a novel form of non-apoptotic cell death, called ferroptosis, whereas the mitochondrial isoform of Gpx4 was previously shown to be crucial for male fertility. Here, we generated and analyzed mice with a targeted mutation of the active site selenocysteine of Gpx4 (Gpx4_U46S). Mice homozygous for Gpx4_U46S died at the same embryonic stage (E7.5) as Gpx4(-/-) embryos as expected. Surprisingly, male mice heterozygous for Gpx4_U46S presented subfertility. Subfertility was manifested in a reduced number of litters from heterozygous breeding and an impairment of spermatozoa to fertilize oocytes in vitro. Morphologically, sperm isolated from heterozygous Gpx4_U46S mice revealed many structural abnormalities particularly in the spermatozoa midpiece due to improper oxidation and polymerization of sperm capsular proteins and malformation of the mitochondrial capsule surrounding and stabilizing sperm mitochondria. These findings are reminiscent of sperm isolated from selenium-deprived rodents or from mice specifically lacking mitochondrial Gpx4. Due to a strongly facilitated incorporation of Ser in the polypeptide chain as compared with selenocysteine at the UGA codon, expression of the catalytically inactive Gpx4_U46S was found to be strongly increased. Because the stability of the mitochondrial capsule of mature spermatozoa depends on the moonlighting function of Gpx4 both as an enzyme oxidizing capsular protein thiols and as a structural protein, tightly controlled expression of functional Gpx4 emerges as a key for full male fertility.",

The gonadal tissue, with abundance of highly unsaturated fatty acids, high rates of cell division, and variety of testis enzymes results very vulnerable to the overexpression of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to address this risk, testis has developed a sophisticated array of antioxidant systems comprising both enzymes and free radical scavengers.

Recent advances in bisulfite sequencing allow detection of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) achieving high sensitivity, but accurately identifying heterozygous SNVs from partially C-to-T converted sequences remains challenging. We designed two methods, BayesWC and BinomWC, that substantially improved the precision of heterozygous SNV calls from \u223c80% to 99% while retaining comparable recalls. With these SNV calls, we provided functions for allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) analysis and visualizing the methylation status on reads. Applying ASM analysis to a previous dataset, we found that an average of 1.5% of investigated regions showed allelic methylation, which were significantly enriched in transposon elements and likely to be shared by the same cell-type. A dynamic fragment strategy was utilized for DMR analysis in low-coverage data and was able to find differentially methylated regions (DMRs) related to key genes involved in tumorigenesis using a public cancer dataset. Finally, we integrated 40 applications into the software package CGmapTools to analyze DNA methylomes.

Treatments include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and alternative therapies. Alternative therapies for excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors include yoga, aerobic exercise, acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis, and inositol and N-acetylcysteine, among others. Objective \u2022 This review article intended to review the current literature on the alternative therapies to provide a brief update on their benefits for the treatment of excoriation disorder for use in conjunction with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in the management of a challenging group of patients. Design \u2022 This review (focusing on literature published in the last 15 y, selected from a search of PubMed) critically considers the evidence for the use of alternative therapies in the treatment of excoriation disorder. Setting \u2022 This review was conducted at the National University of Asunci\u00f3n (San Lorenzo, Paraguay). Results \u2022 Results for yoga were as follows: This technique may influence the structure and functioning of the areas of emotional processing involved in the pathophysiology of excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania. Although still limited, the current research team's use of yoga as a treatment has given useful results. Results for aerobic exercise were as follows: People suffering from excoriation disorder and other-body focused repetitive behaviors generally have a worsening of their behaviors in times of negative mood and anxiety. As exercise has qualities that allow individuals to improve their mood and reduce their anxiety, it is likely that it also can help reduce behaviors like hair pulling or scratching, and it should be considered to be an adjunctive therapy. Results for acupuncture were as follows: The mechanism of action of acupuncture increases serotonergic activity and releases endorphins in the hypothalamus and limbic region, which could be beneficial in patients with trichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results for biofeedback were as follows: Several case reports have suggested the value of biofeedback in reducing tics, which bear some psychophysiological similarities to body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results for hypnosis were as follows: When used as a channel for other types of interventions, such as psychotherapy, hypnosis can help counteract the stress that triggers the picking behaviors in some patients. Results for inositol and N-acetylcysteine were as follows: Although more research is needed, these are promising drugs that may be helpful in reducing the picking behavior. Conclusions \u2022 The review indicates that yoga, aerobic exercise, acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis, and inositol and N-acetylcysteine all show promise in the treatment of excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania. In the current research team's experience, mainly yoga and aerobic exercise have been shown useful in combination with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Obtaining solid evidence about the long-term beneficial effects of these alternative therapies for the treatment of excoriation disorder requires more investigation.",

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been implicated in disease associations through overlaps between eQTLs and GWAS signals. However, the abundance of eQTLs and the strong correlation structure (LD) in the genome make it likely that some of these overlaps are coincidental and not driven by the same functional variants. In the present study, we propose an empirical methodology, which we call Regulatory Trait Concordance (RTC) that accounts for local LD structure and integrates eQTLs and GWAS results in order to reveal the subset of association signals that are due to cis eQTLs. We simulate genomic regions of various LD patterns with both a single or two causal variants and show that our score outperforms SNP correlation metrics, be they statistical (r(2)) or historical (D'). Following the observation of a significant abundance of regulatory signals among currently published GWAS loci, we apply our method with the goal to prioritize relevant genes for each of the respective complex traits. We detect several potential disease-causing regulatory effects, with a strong enrichment for immunity-related conditions, consistent with the nature of the cell line tested (LCLs). Furthermore, we present an extension of the method in trans, where interrogating the whole genome for downstream effects of the disease variant can be informative regarding its unknown primary biological effect. We conclude that integrating cellular phenotype associations with organismal complex traits will facilitate the biological interpretation of the genetic effects on these traits.",

RNA-Seq based quantification at whole-gene resolution, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is likely to account for this observed lack of colocalisation as subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons can be concealed. We performed integrative cis-eQTL analysis using association statistics from twenty autoimmune diseases (560 independent loci) and RNA-Seq data from 373 individuals of the Geuvadis cohort profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level resolution in lymphoblastoid cell lines. After stringently testing for a shared causal variant using both the Joint Likelihood Mapping and Regulatory Trait Concordance frameworks, we found that gene-level quantification significantly underestimated the number of causal cis-eQTLs. Only 5.0-5.3% of loci were found to share a causal cis-eQTL at gene-level compared to 12.9-18.4% at exon-level and 9.6-10.5% at junction-level. More than a fifth of autoimmune loci shared an underlying causal variant in a single cell type by combining all five quantification types; a marked increase over current estimates of steady-state causal cis-eQTLs. Causal cis-eQTLs detected at different quantification types localised to discrete epigenetic annotations. We applied a linear mixed-effects model to distinguish cis-eQTLs modulating all expression elements of a gene from those where the signal is only evident in a subset of elements. Exon-level analysis detected disease-associated cis-eQTLs that subtly altered transcription globally across the target gene. We dissected in detail the genetic associations of systemic lupus erythematosus and functionally annotated the candidate genes. Many of the known and novel genes were concealed at gene-level (e.g. IKZF2, TYK2, LYST). Our findings are provided as a web resource.",

We have adapted the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) score to measure the probability of eQTLs being active in multiple tissues and to calculate the probability that a GWAS-associated variant and an eQTL tag the same functional effect. By normalizing the GWAS-eQTL probabilities by the tissue-sharing estimates for eQTLs, we generate relative tissue-causality profiles for GWAS traits. Our approach not only implicates the gene likely mediating individual GWAS signals, but also highlights tissues where the genetic causality for an individual trait is likely manifested.",

Exposure to BPA leads to alterations in steroidogenesis of ovarian granulosa cells. Here, we analyzed the mechanism by which BPA alters progesterone biosynthesis in immature rat granulosa cells. BPA increased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in granulosa cells; however, BPA prevented the basal and the FSH-induced progesterone production. BPA caused sequestration of cholesterol to the perinuclear area, as evident by the Filipin staining. BPA decreased mRNA expression of ATP binding cassette transporter-A1 (Abca1) and increased level of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1. Addition of exogenous cell-permeable cholesterol restored the effect of BPA on Abca1 and Star mRNA expression and partially reversed BPA's effect on progesterone production.

Current diagnosis for NP-C is based on observation of the accumulated cholesterol in fibroblasts of affected individuals, using an invasive and time expensive test, called Filipin staining. Lately, two metabolites that are markedly increased in NP-C patients are arising as biomarkers for this disease screening: 7-ketocholesterol and cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol, both oxidized cholesterol products. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the performance of cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol analysis for the screening and monitoring of NPC patients, correlating it with chitotriosidase levels, Filipin staining and molecular analysis.

For Filipin staining, it was found 1 false positive, 7 false negative and 24 inconclusive cases, showing that this assay has important limitations for NP-C diagnosis. Besides, we found a significant decrease in cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol concentrations in NP-C patients under therapy with miglustat when compared to non-treated patients.

These thermosensor channels play a role in pain processing. We have provided evidence previously that lipid raft disruption influenced the TRP channel activation, and a carboxamido-steroid compound (C1) inhibited TRPV1 activation. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether this compound exerts its effect through lipid raft disruption and the steroid backbone (C3) or whether altered position of the carboxamido group (C2) influences the inhibitory action by measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients on isolated neurons and calcium-uptake on receptor-expressing CHO cells. Membrane cholesterol content was measured by filipin staining and membrane polarization by fluorescence spectroscopy. Both the percentage of responsive cells and the magnitude of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhancement evoked by the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin were significantly inhibited after C1 and C2 incubation, but not after C3 administration. C1 was able to reduce other TRP channel activation as well. The compounds induced cholesterol depletion in CHO cells, but only C1 induced changes in membrane polarization. The inhibitory action of the compounds on TRP channel activation develops by lipid raft disruption, and the presence and the position of the carboxamido group is essential.",

The most promising probe, a P1-BODIPY conjugate FP-5, was analysed in detail and showed an intensive labelling of cellular membranes followed by intracellular redistribution into various cholesterol rich organelles and vesicles. FP-5 displayed a stronger signal, with faster kinetics, than the commercial TF-Chol probe. In addition, cells with pharmacologically disrupted cholesterol transport, or with a genetic mutation of cholesterol transporting protein NPC1, exhibited strong and fast FP-5 signal in the endo/lysosomal compartment, co-localizing with filipin staining of cholesterol. Hence, FP-5 has high potential as a new probe for monitoring cholesterol trafficking and its disorders.",

Here, we identify TIAM1 as a critical antagonist of CRC progression through inhibiting TAZ and YAP, effectors of WNT signaling. We demonstrate that TIAM1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus antagonizing TAZ/YAP by distinct mechanisms in the two compartments. In the cytoplasm, TIAM1 localizes to the destruction complex and promotes TAZ degradation by enhancing its interaction with \u03b2TrCP. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion. Importantly, high nuclear TIAM1 in clinical specimens associates with increased CRC patient survival. Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity.",

We succeeded in establishing the Tiam1 knockdown colorectal cancer cell line using human immunodeficiency virus lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and found that the silencing of Tiam1 resulted in the effective inhibition of in vitro cell growth and of the invasive ability of colorectal cancer cells. Using an orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice, we confirmed that Tiam1 silencing could reduce tumor growth by subcutaneous injection and could suppress lung and liver metastases of colorectal cancer cells.

Simultaneous observation of fluorescently-labeled NLS-bearing proteins, lamin B receptor (LBR)-GFP, and Hoechst33342-stained chromosomes revealed that nuclear membranes reassembled around chromosomes by 5 minutes after the onset of anaphase (early telophase) whereas nuclear import function was recovered later, at 8 minutes. GFP-tagged emerin also accumulated on chromosomes 5 minutes after the onset of anaphase. Interestingly, emerin and LBR initially accumulated at distinct, separate locations, but then became uniform 8 minutes after the onset of anaphase, concurrent with the recovery of nuclear import function. We further determined the timing of NPC assembly by immunofluorescence staining of cells fixed at precise times after the onset of anaphase.

Failure to import Tf1-Gag into the nucleus in a nup124 null mutant resulted in complete loss of Tf1 transposition. Similarly, nuclear import of HIV-1 Vpr was impaired in nup124 null mutant strains and cells became resistant to Vpr's cell-killing activity. On the basis of protein domain similarity, the human nucleoporin Nup153 was identified as a putative homolog of Nup124p. We demonstrate that in vitro-translated Nup124p and Nup153 coimmunoprecipitate Tf1-Gag or HIV-1 Vpr. Though full-length Nup153 was unable to complement the Tf1 transposition defect in a nup124 null mutant, we provide evidence that both nucleoporins share a unique N-terminal domain, Nup124p(AA264-454) and Nup153(AA448-634) that is absolutely essential for Tf1 transposition. Epigenetic overexpression of this domain in a wild-type (nup124(+)) background blocked Tf1 activity implying that sequences from Nup124p and the human Nup153 challenged the same pathway affecting Tf1 transposition.

The scope of Nup153 function also extends beyond the canonical view of the pore as a trafficking gateway. During the transition into mitosis, Nup153 directs proteins involved in membrane remodeling to the nuclear envelope. As cells exit mitosis, Nup153 is recruited to the chromosomal surface, where nuclear pores are formed anew in a complicated process still under much experimental scrutiny. In addition, Nup153 is targeted for protease cleavage during apoptosis and in response to certain viral infections, providing molecular insight into pore reconfiguration during cell response.

Using foci formation of 53BP1 as a readout in two human cell lines, we performed an siRNA-based functional high-content microscopy screen for modulators of cellular response to ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we provide the complete results of this screen as an information resource, and validate and functionally characterize one of the identified 'hits': a nuclear pore component NUP153 as a novel factor specifically required for 53BP1 nuclear import. Using a range of cell and molecular biology approaches including live-cell imaging, we show that knockdown of NUP153 prevents 53BP1, but not several other DDR factors, from entering the nuclei in the newly forming daughter cells. This translates into decreased IR-induced 53BP1 focus formation, delayed DNA repair and impaired cell survival after IR. In addition, NUP153 depletion exacerbates DNA damage caused by replication stress. Finally, we show that the C-terminal part of NUP153 is required for effective 53BP1 nuclear import, and that 53BP1 is imported to the nucleus through the NUP153-importin-\u03b2 interplay. Our data define the structure-function relationships within this emerging 53BP1-NUP153/importin-\u03b2 pathway and implicate this mechanism in the maintenance of genome integrity.",

In this study, we have used thin-section transmission electron microscopy to determine the structural consequences of altering the expression of Nup153 in human cells. We show that the assembly and integrity of the nuclear basket is not affected by Nup153 depletion, whereas its integrity is perturbed in cells expressing high concentrations of the zinc-finger domain of Nup153. Moreover, even mild over-expression of Nup153 is coinciding with massive changes in nuclear organization and it is the excess of the zinc-finger domain of Nup153 that is sufficient to induce these rearrangements.

Notably, a number of cardiovascular disorders have been linked to alterations in epigenetic mechanisms. Here we aimed to determine the contribution of Nup153 to the epigenetic alterations occurring in cardiomyopathy of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice (C57BL/10ScSn-Dmd mdx /J). Nup153 was lysine-acetylated and its expression was significantly increased at protein level in mdx hearts compared with controls. Accordingly, lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) activity associated with Nup153 was higher in mdx hearts paralleling increased binding with the lysine acetylases P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and p300. Interestingly, Nup153 silencing in mdx organotypic heart tissue slices caused a reduction in PCAF- and p300-specific activities. Remarkably, the level of nitric oxide (NO), which is reduced in mdx mice, was important for KAT-dependent regulation of Nup153. In fact, treatment of mdx heart tissue with an NO donor or the KAT inhibitor anacardic acid normalized Nup153 protein expression. Nup153 was recruited to chromatin and regulated the transcription of genes involved in cardiac remodelling, including the actin-binding protein nexilin. Accordingly, nexilin protein expression was abrogated by Nup153 silencing in mdx organotypic cultures. Electrophysiological and molecular experiments revealed that Nup153 overexpression in normal cardiomyocytes increases Ca v 1.2 calcium channel expression and function. Alterations in Nup153 protein expression and intracellular localization were also found in dystrophic cardiomyocytes derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, Nup153 up-regulation and increased acetylation were also found in the heart of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Our data indicate that Nup153 is an epigenetic regulator which, upon altered NO signalling, mediates the activation of genes potentially associated with early dystrophic cardiac remodelling.",

The balance between NHEJ and HR depends, in part, on whether 53BP1 predominates in binding to damage sites, where it protects the DNA ends from resection. The nucleoporin Nup153 has been implicated in the DNA damage response, attributed to a role in promoting nuclear import of 53BP1. Here, we define a distinct requirement for Nup153 in 53BP1 intranuclear targeting to damage foci and report that Nup153 likely facilitates the role of another nucleoporin, Nup50, in 53BP1 targeting. The requirement for Nup153 and Nup50 in promoting 53BP1 recruitment to damage foci induced by either etoposide or olaparib is abrogated in cells deficient for BRCA1 or its partner BARD1, but not in cells deficient for BRCA2. Together, our results further highlight the antagonistic relationship between 53BP1 and BRCA1, and place Nup153 and Nup50 in a molecular pathway that regulates 53BP1 function by counteracting BRCA1-mediated events.",

This protein exhibits a tripartite structure consisting of a zinc finger domain flanked by large (60-70 kD) NH2- and COOH-terminal domains. When full-length human Nup153 is expressed in BHK cells, it accumulates appropriately at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. Targeting information for Nup153 resides in the NH2-terminal domain since this region of the molecule can direct an ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, to the nuclear face of the nuclear pore complex. Overexpression of Nup153 results in the dramatic accumulation of nuclear poly (A)+ RNA, suggesting an inhibition of RNA export from the nucleus. This is not due to a general decline in nucleocytoplasmic transport or to occlusion or loss of nuclear pore complexes since nuclear protein import is unaffected. While overexpression of certain Nup153 constructs was found to result in the formation of unusual intranuclear membrane arrays, this structural phenotype could not be correlated with the effects on poly (A)+ RNA distribution. The RNA trafficking defect was, however, dependent upon the Nup153 COOH-terminal domain which contains most of the XFXFG repeats. It is proposed that this region of Nup153, lying within the distal ring of the nuclear basket, represents a docking site for mRNA molecules exiting the nucleus.",

Unfortunately, this treatment is frequently limited by cytopenias, precluding a high-risk group characterized by baseline thrombocytopenia. Additionally, there are no approved treatments for patients who have progressed while receiving ruxolitinib. Pacritinib is a novel JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor associated with less treatment-related myelosuppression that has the potential to fill these unmet treatment needs. Areas covered: This review will describe the preclinical rationale for JAK2/FLT3 inhibition, review the pharmacology of pacritinib, and detail available clinical data for pacritinib treatment of myelofibrosis. The circumstances surrounding the full clinical hold temporarily placed on pacritinib will also be explored. Expert commentary: Pacritinib has demonstrated promising results in patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia. Improvements in splenomegaly and symptom burden were observed with the 200 mg twice-daily dose in PERSIST-2, including those with platelet counts &lt;50,000 mm. Safety concerns pertaining to cardiovascular events and bleeding that arose in an early analysis of PERSIST-2 were likely related to the advanced disease state enrolled rather than clear attribution to pacritinib. The results of an ongoing dose-finding, phase II study are eagerly awaited in order to move this promising myelofibrosis therapy forward.",

However, the association of ruxolitinib therapy with myelosuppression indicates the continued need for optimal treatment choices in myelofibrosis. Pacritinib, a dual JAK2 and FLT3 inhibitor, improves disease-related symptoms and signs with manageable gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with myelofibrosis with splenomegaly and high-risk features, without causing overt myelosuppression, and therefore may provide an important treatment option for a range of patients with myelofibrosis.

This multicenter phase 2 study further characterized the safety and efficacy of pacritinib in the treatment of patients with MF. Eligible patients had clinical splenomegaly poorly controlled with standard therapies or were newly diagnosed with intermediate- or high-risk Lille score. Patients with any degree of cytopenia were eligible. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. At entry, 40% had hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL and 43% had platelets &lt;100 000\u00d7 10(9)/L.

MF is often characterised by debilitating symptoms and JAK inhibitors (JAKIs) have revolutionised available therapeutic options. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and 2 inhibitor, is the only currently approved agent. Several other JAKIs are undergoing evaluation in the clinical trial setting and Pacritinib , a novel JAK2 and FLT3 inhibitor, is at an advanced stage of investigation with recent completion of a Phase III trial and another ongoing. Within this article we focus on pacritinib, summarising the development, preclinical and up-to-date results from the Phase I - III trials. We present the most recent data on efficacy and safety and indirectly compare this novel JAKI with ruxolitinib. The kinome array data for pacritinib suggests that it has a range of targets differing to those for ruxolitinib. Pacritinib appears to be an effective agent for the control of MF-related symptoms and splenomegaly with potentially fewer haematological side-effects when compared with ruxolitinib and seems a particularly promising agent for anaemic and thrombocytopenic patients. It is also an attractive drug for potential combination studies due to its good tolerability.",

But there are shortcomings: Many recombinant proteins are quickly degraded by proteolytic enzymes or are rapidly cleared by kidney filtration resulting in a short circulating half-life. Additionally they are prone to be recognized by the immune system resulting in the generation of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. PEGylation, a process by which polyethylene glycol chains are attached to protein and peptide drugs, can overcome these and other shortcomings. By increasing the molecular mass of proteins and peptides and shielding them from proteolytic enzymes, PEGylation primarily improves pharmacokinetics and helps to prevent adverse drug reactions.",

Then the degrees and the patterns of DNA methylation in the leaves were measured on the 14th day using Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) technique. The results showed that the DNA methylated profile of I. sinensis was affected by Pb and Cd stress. There was no significant difference in the amount of DNA methylation among control check (CK), Pb stress group, and Cd stress group (CK 46.96%, Pb 48.23%, and Cd 48.1%). However, full-methylation level of Pb stress group (28.34%) and Cd stress group (20.25%) was lower than control (33.91%), in contrast, hemi-methylation level Pb stress group (19.89%) and Cd stress group (27.85%) were higher than control (13.04%). The change of patterns from no methylation or hemi-methylation of internal and external cytosines into full-methylation of internal and external cytosines accounted for a large proportion in enhanced methylation aspects. The full-methylation into no methylation or hemi- or full-methylation of internal and external cytosines occupied most of demethylation. The proportion of DNA methylation (including hypermethylation) by both Pb and Cd stresses is nearly equal (39.04% and 39.71%), but the proportion of DNA demethylation by Cd is higher than that by Pb (46.86% than 33.92%).",

However, its physiological responses for heavy metal remain to be elucidated. Here, through employing proteomics approach, we found that excess Cu significantly induced the expressions of four DNA methylation related proteins in H. verticillata, which were the homologues of two domains rearranged methyltransferases (DRM), a methyltransferases chromomethylase (CMT) and a histone H3 lysine-9 specific SUVH6-like (SUVH6). Consistently, a dramatic change in DNA methylation patterns was detected in excess Cu-exposed H. verticillata. Surprisingly, administration of the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMZ) that block production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could trigger the remethylation of genomic sites that were demethylated by excess Cu, indicating that Cu-induced ROS might be another way to affect DNA methylation. Further analysis suggested this changed DNA methylation may be owing to the ROS-induced DNA damage. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that two different ways to influence DNA methylation in excess Cu-treated H. verticillata.",

Most of the entropy of short read data lies not in the sequence of read bases themselves but in their Quality Scores-the confidence measurement that each base has been sequenced correctly. Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses. We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy. Our model leverages a corpus of k-mers to reduce the entropy of the quality scores and thereby the compressibility of these data (in FASTQ or SAM/BAM/CRAM files), resulting in compression ratios that significantly exceeds those of other methods. Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy. In addition to extensive empirical evaluation, we also derive novel theoretical insights that explain the empirical performance and pitfalls of corpus-based quality score compression schemes in general. Finally, we show that as a positive side effect of compression, the model can lead to improved genotyping accuracy.

Particular attention has focused on the binding of plasminogen (Plg) to bacterial surfaces, as it has been shown that this interaction contributes to bacterial adhesion to host cells, invasion of host tissues, and evasion of the immune system. Several bacterial proteins are known to serve as receptors for Plg including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a cytoplasmic enzyme that appears on the cell surface in this moonlighting role. Although Plg typically binds to these receptors via several lysine-binding domains, the specific interactions that occur have not been documented in all cases. However, identification of the relevant residues could help define strategies for mitigating the virulence of important human pathogens, such as <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (Sp). To shed light on this question, we have described a combination of peptide-spot array screening, competition and SPR assays, high-resolution crystallography, and mutational analyses to characterize the interaction between SpGAPDH and Plg. We identified three SpGAPDH lysine residues that were instrumental in defining the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction. Altogether, the integration of the data presented in this work allows us to propose a structural model for the molecular interaction of the SpGAPDH-Plg complex.",

Previous studies have shown that D. immitis can use their excretory/secretory (ES) and surface antigens to enhance fibrinolysis, which could limit the formation of clots in its surrounding environment. Moreover, several isoforms of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and galectin (GAL) were identified in both antigenic extracts as plasminogen-binding proteins. The aim of this work is to study the interaction of the GAPDH and GAL of D. immitis with the fibrinolytic system of the host. This study includes the cloning, sequencing and expression of the recombinant forms of the GAPDH and GAL of D. immitis (rDiGAPDH and rDiGAL) and the analysis of their capacity as plasminogen-binding proteins. The results indicate that rDiGAPDH and rDiGAL are able to bind plasminogen and stimulate plasmin generation by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This interaction needs the involvement of lysine residues, many of which are located externally in both proteins as have been shown by the molecular modeling of their secondary structures. In addition, we show that rDiGAPDH and rDiGAL enhance the expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) on canine endothelial cells in culture and that both proteins are expressed on the surface of D. immitis in close contact with the blood of the host. These data suggest that D. immitis could use the associated surface GAPDH and GAL as physiological plasminogen receptors to shift the fibrinolytic balance towards the generation of plasmin, which might constitute a survival mechanism to avoid the clot formation in its intravascular habitat.",

To date a role for extracellular GAPDH in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteria has not been described. The aim of this study was to analyze the extracellular localization of GAPDH in enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli strains and to examine its interaction with host components that could be related to the infection mechanism. Recombinant E. coli GAPDH was purified and polyclonal antibodies were obtained. Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy showed that GAPDH is located on the bacterial surface and released to the culture medium of EHEC and EPEC strains. GAPDH export in these Gram-negative pathogens depends on the external medium, is not mediated by vesicles and leads to an extracellular active enzyme. Non-pathogenic E. coli strains do not secrete GAPDH. Two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis showed that in E. coli GAPDH is present at least in two major forms with different isoelectric points. Of these forms, the more basic is secreted. Purified GAPDH was found to bind human plasminogen and fibrinogen in Far-Western blot and ELISA-based assays. In addition, GAPDH remained associated with colonic Caco-2 epithelial cells after adhesion of EHEC or EPEC. These observations indicate that exported GAPDH may act as a virulence factor which could contribute to EHEC and EPEC pathogenesis. This is the first description of an extracellular localization for this enzyme, with a function other than its glycolytic role in Gram-negative pathogens.",

WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C&gt;T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C&gt;T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C&gt;T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling.

CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m<sup>2</sup>). We developed a population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the liposome. The PK model demonstrates prolonged exposure to cytarabine and daunorubicin without increases in non-hematologic toxicity that indicates retention of the drugs within the liposome. The unique pharmacology of this formulation may allow for simplified regimens and improved outcomes.",

Studies on a null mutation in mice previously revealed that Nup133 is essential for embryonic development but not for mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) proliferation. Using single-pore detection and average NE-fluorescence intensity, we find that Nup133 is dispensable for interphase and postmitotic NPC scaffold assembly in pluripotent mESCs. However, loss of Nup133 specifically perturbs the formation of the nuclear basket as manifested by the absence of Tpr in about half of the NPCs combined with altered dynamics of Nup153. We further demonstrate that its central domain mediates Nup133's role in assembling Tpr and Nup153 into a properly configured nuclear basket. Our findings thus revisit the role of the Y-complex in pore biogenesis and provide insights into the interplay between NPC scaffold architecture, nuclear basket assembly, and the generation of heterogeneity among NPCs.",

Here we show that the NPC basket proteins Nup1 and Nup60 directly induce membrane curvature by amphipathic helix insertion into the lipid bilayer. In a cell-free system, both Nup1 and Nup60 transform spherical liposomes into highly curved membrane structures. In vivo, high levels of the Nup1/Nup60 amphipathic helices cause deformation of the yeast nuclear membrane, whereas adjacent helical regions contribute to anchoring the basket to the NPC core. Basket amphipathic helices are functionally linked to distinct transmembrane nucleoporins of the NPC core, suggesting a key contribution to the membrane remodeling events that underlie NPC assembly.",

The transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) was suggested to interact with NXF1 and to shuttle between transcription sites and the NPC. Here, we characterize the dynamics of human TREX-2 and show that it stably associates with the NPC basket. Moreover, the association of TREX-2 with the NPC requires the basket nucleoporins NUP153 and TPR, but is independent of transcription. Differential profiles of mRNA nuclear accumulation reveal that TREX-2 functions similarly to basket nucleoporins, but differently from NXF1. Thus, our results show that TREX-2 is an NPC-associated complex in mammalian cells and suggest that it is involved in putative NPC basket-related functions.",

We report that yeast Esc1, a non-NPC nuclear envelope protein, is required both for proper assembly of the nuclear basket, a structure extending into the nucleus from the NPC, and for normal NPC localization of the Ulp1 SUMO protease. In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Loss of Esc1 (or Nup60) alters SUMO conjugate accumulation and enhances ulp1 mutant defects. Similar to previous findings with Mlp1, both Esc1 and Ulp1 help retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. Therefore, these proteins are essential for proper nuclear basket function, which includes mRNA surveillance and regulation of SUMO protein dynamics. The results raise the possibility that NPC-localized protein desumoylation may be a key regulatory event preventing inappropriate pre-mRNA export.",

Here, Nup153 is localized by immunogold electron microscopy to a position on the nuclear ring of the NPC. Nuclear reconstitution is used to investigate the role of Nup153 in nucleo- cytoplasmic transport and NPC architecture. NPCs assembled in the absence of Nup153 lacked several nuclear basket components, were unevenly distributed in the NE and, unlike wild-type NPCs, were mobile within the NE. Importin alpha/beta-mediated protein import into the nucleus was strongly reduced in the absence of Nup153, while transportin-mediated import was unaffected. This was due to a reduction in import complex translocation rather than to defective receptor recycling. Our results therefore reveal functions for Nup153 in NPC assembly, in anchoring NPCs within the NE and in mediating specific nuclear import events.",

Here, one SLAP is identified as the nuclear pore complex protein Nup153, one member of the F/GXFG motif-containing nucleoporins. In vitro translated Nup153 and lamin B(3) co-immunoprecipitate, and lamin B(3) interacts specifically with the C-terminal domain of Nup153. During nuclear envelope assembly, other F/GXFG-containing nucleoporins are incorporated into the nuclear envelope preceding lamina assembly. Incorporation of Nup153 occurs at the same time as lamina assembly. When lamina assembly is prevented using the dominant-negative mutant XlaminB delta 2+, Nup153 does not appear at the nuclear envelope, while other F/GXFG-containing nucleoporins and Nup93 are recruited normally. When the lamina of pre-assembled nuclei is disrupted using the same dominant-negative mutant, the distribution of other nucleoporins is unaffected. However, Nup153 recruitment at the nuclear envelope is lost. Our results indicate that both the recruitment and maintenance of Nup153 at the pore are dependent upon the integrity of the lamina.",

Using light and EM immunolocalization, we determined that mammalian Tpr is concentrated within the nuclear basket of the pore complex in a distribution similar to Nup153 and Nup98. Antibody localization together with imaging of GFP-Tpr in living cells revealed that Tpr is in discrete foci inside the nucleus similar to several other nucleoporins but is not present in intranuclear filamentous networks (Zimowska et al., 1997) or in long filaments extending from the pore complex (Cordes et al., 1997) as proposed. Injection of anti-Tpr antibodies into mitotic cells resulted in depletion of Tpr from the nuclear envelope without loss of other pore complex basket proteins. Whereas nuclear import mediated by a basic amino acid signal was unaffected, nuclear export mediated by a leucine-rich signal was retarded significantly. Nuclear injection of anti-Tpr antibodies in interphase cells similarly yielded inhibition of protein export but not import. These results indicate that Tpr is a nucleoporin of the nuclear basket with a role in nuclear protein export.",

Herein we have identified a vertebrate nucleoporin, Nup93, in both human and Xenopus that has proved to be an evolutionarily related homologue of the yeast nucleoporin Nic96p. Polyclonal antiserum to human Nup93 detects corresponding proteins in human, rat, and Xenopus cells. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy localize vertebrate Nup93 at the nuclear basket and at or near the nuclear entry to the gated channel of the pore. Immunoprecipitation from both mammalian and Xenopus cell extracts indicates that a small fraction of Nup93 physically interacts with the nucleoporin p62, just as yeast Nic96p interacts with the yeast p62 homologue. However, a large fraction of vertebrate Nup93 is extracted from pores and is also present in Xenopus egg extracts in complex with a newly discovered 205-kDa protein. Mass spectrometric sequencing of the human 205-kDa protein reveals that this protein is encoded by an open reading frame, KIAAO225, present in the human database. The putative human nucleoporin of 205 kDa has related sequence homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The analyze the role of the Nup93 complex in the pore, nuclei were assembled that lack the Nup93 complex after immunodepletion of a Xenopus nuclear reconstitution extract. The Nup93-complex-depleted nuclei are clearly defective for correct nuclear pore assembly. From these experiments, we conclude that the vertebrate and yeast pore have significant homology in their functionally important cores and that, with the identification of Nup93 and the 205-kDa protein, we have extended the knowledge of the nearest-neighbor interactions of this core in both yeast and vertebrates.",

Assembly of a nuclear pore complex requires the organization of many soluble sub-complexes into a final massive structure embedded in the nuclear envelope. By use of a LacI/LacO reporter system, we were able to assess nucleoporin (Nup) interactions, show that they occur with a high level of specificity, and identify nucleoporins sufficient for initiation of the complex process of NPC assembly in vivo. Eleven nucleoporins from different sub-complexes were fused to LacI-CFP and transfected separately into a human cell line containing a stably integrated LacO DNA array. The LacI-Nup fusion proteins, which bound to the array, were examined for their ability to recruit endogenous nucleoporins to the intranuclear LacO site. Many could recruit nucleoporins of the same sub-complex and a number could also recruit other sub-complexes. Strikingly, Nup133 and Nup107 of the Nup107/160 subcomplex and Nup153 and Nup50 of the nuclear pore basket recruited a near full complement of nucleoporins to the LacO array. Furthermore, Nup133 and Nup153 efficiently targeted the LacO array to the nuclear periphery. Our data support a hierarchical, seeded assembly pathway and identify Nup133 and Nup153 as effective \"seeds\" for NPC assembly. In addition, we show that this system can be applied to functional studies of individual nucleoporin domains as well as to specific nucleoporin disease mutations. We find that the R391H cardiac arrhythmia/sudden death mutation of Nup155 prevents both its subcomplex assembly and nuclear rim targeting of the LacO array.",

To characterize Nup60p further, Nup60p-coated beads were used to capture its interacting proteins from extracts. We find that Nup60p binds to Nup2p and serves as a docking site for Kap95p-Kap60p heterodimers and Kap123p. Nup60p also binds Gsp1p-GTP and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Prp20p, and functions as a Gsp1p guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor by reducing the activity of Prp20p. Yeast lacking Nup60p exhibit minor defects in nuclear export of Kap60p, nuclear import of Kap95p-Kap60p-dependent cargoes, and diffusion of small proteins across the NPC. Yeast lacking Nup60p also fail to anchor Nup2p at the NPC, resulting in the mislocalization of Nup2p to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Purified Nup60p and Nup2p bind each other directly, but the stability of the complex is compromised when Kap60p binds Nup2p. Gsp1p-GTP enhances by 10-fold the affinity between Nup60p and Nup2p, and restores binding of Nup2p-Kap60p complexes to Nup60p. The results suggest a dynamic interaction, controlled by the nucleoplasmic concentration of Gsp1p-GTP, between Nup60p and Nup2p at the NPC.",

By postembedding immunoelectron microscopy, we have mapped the positions of several human NPC proteins relative to the NPC core and its associated basket, including Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, Nup153, Nup205, and the coiled coil-dominated 267-kDa protein Tpr. To further assess their contributions to NPC and basket architecture, the genes encoding Nup93, Nup96, Nup107, and Nup205 were posttranscriptionally silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, complementing recent RNAi experiments on Nup153 and Tpr. We show that Nup96 and Nup107 are core elements of the NPC proper that are essential for NPC assembly and docking of Nup153 and Tpr to the NPC. Nup93 and Nup205 are other NPC core elements that are important for long-term maintenance of NPCs but initially dispensable for the anchoring of Nup153 and Tpr. Immunogold-labeling for Nup98 also results in preferential labeling of NPC core regions, whereas Nup153 is shown to bind via its amino-terminal domain to the nuclear coaxial ring linking the NPC core structures and Tpr. The position of Tpr in turn is shown to coincide with that of the nuclear basket, with different Tpr protein domains corresponding to distinct basket segments. We propose a model in which Tpr constitutes the central architectural element that forms the scaffold of the nuclear basket.",

To understand how the vital process of nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs, the contribution of individual pore proteins must be elucidated. One such protein, the nucleoporin Nup153, is localized to the nuclear basket of the pore complex and has been shown to be a central component of the nuclear transport machinery. Perturbation of Nup153 function was demonstrated previously to block the export of several classes of RNA cargo. Moreover, these studies also showed that Nup153 can stably associate with RNA in vitro. In this study, we have mapped a domain within Nup153, encompassing amino acids 250-400 in human Nup153, that is responsible for RNA association. After cloning this region of Xenopus Nup153, we performed a cross-species analysis. Despite variation in sequence conservation between Drosophila, Xenopus, and human, this domain of Nup153 displayed robust RNA binding activity in each case, indicating that this property is a hallmark feature of Nup153 and pointing toward a subset of amino acid residues that are key to conferring this ability. We have further determined that a recombinant fragment of Nup153 can bind directly to RNA and that this fragment can interact with endogenous RNA targets. Our findings identify a functionally conserved domain in Nup153 and suggest a role for RNA binding in Nup153 function at the nuclear pore.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of this nuclear pore-dependent mRNA quality control, including the sumoylated targets of Ulp1, have remained unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that the apparent 'pre-mRNA leakage' phenotype arising upon ULP1 inactivation is shared by sumoylation mutants of the THO complex, an early mRNP biogenesis factor. Importantly, we establish that alteration of THO complex activity differentially impairs the expression of intronless and intron-containing reporter genes, rather than triggering bona fide 'pre-mRNA leakage'. Indeed, we show that the presence of introns within THO target genes attenuates the effect of THO inactivation on their transcription. Epistasis analyses further clarify that different nuclear pore components influence intron-containing gene expression at distinct stages. Ulp1, whose maintenance at nuclear pores depends on the Nup84 complex, impacts on THO-dependent gene expression, whereas the nuclear basket-associated Mlp1/Pml39 proteins prevent pre-mRNA export at a later stage, contributing to mRNA quality control. Our study thus highlights the multiplicity of mechanisms by which nuclear pores contribute to gene expression, and further provides the first evidence that intronic sequences can alleviate early mRNP biogenesis defects.",

We evaluated lucatumumab in a phase I clinical trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg. Four patients at doses of 4.5 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days. Saturation of CD40 receptor on CLL cells was uniform at all doses post-treatment but also persisted at trough time points in the 3.0 mg/kg or greater cohorts. At the MTD, the median half-life of lucatumumab was 50 h following the first infusion, and 124 h following the fourth infusion. In summary, lucatumumab had acceptable tolerability, pharmacokinetics that supported chronic dosing and pharmacodynamic target antagonism at doses of 3.0 mg/kg, but demonstrated minimal single-agent activity. Future efforts with lucatumumab in CLL should focus on combination-based therapy.",

The HSPA (Hsp70) multigene family includes the widely studied HSPA1A (Hsp70-1) and the little studied HSPA6 (Hsp70B') which is present in the human genome and not in mouse and rat. The effect of knockdown of HSPA6 and HSPA1A expression was examined in relation to the ability of differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells to tolerate thermal stress. Low dose co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol, which induces Hsps, enhanced the ability of differentiated neurons to survive heat shock. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of HSPA6 and HSPA1A resulted in loss of the protective effect of co-application of celastrol/arimoclomol. More pronounced effects on neuronal viability were apparent at 44 \u00b0C heat shock compared to 43 \u00b0C. siRNA knockdown suggests that HSPA6 and HSPA1A contribute to protection of differentiated human neuronal cells from cellular stress.",

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with rapidly progressive <i>SOD1</i>-mutant ALS were randomized 1:1 to receive arimoclomol 200 mg tid or matching placebo for up to 12 months. Study procedures were performed using a mix of in-person and remote assessments. Primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome was efficacy, with survival as the principal measure. Additional efficacy measures were the rates of decline of the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 6 seconds (FEV6), and the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS). Thirty-eight participants were randomized. Thirty-six (19 placebo, 17 arimoclomol) were included in the prespecified intent-to-treat analysis. Apart from respiratory function, groups were generally well-balanced at baseline. Adverse events occurred infrequently, and were usually mild and deemed unlikely or not related to study drug. Adjusting for riluzole and baseline ALSFRS-R, survival favored arimoclomol with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-1.80). ALSFRS-R and FEV6 declined more slowly in the arimoclomol group, with treatment differences of 0.5 point/month (95% CI -0.63 to 1.63) and 1.24 percent predicted/month (95% CI -2.77 to 5.25), respectively, and the CAFS similarly favored arimoclomol. This study provides Class II evidence that arimoclomol is safe and well-tolerated at a dosage of 200 mg tid for up to 12 months.

GBA mutations commonly affect GCase function by perturbing its protein homeostasis rather than its catalytic activity. Heat shock proteins are well known cytoprotective molecules with functions in protein homeostasis and lysosomal function and their manipulation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for GD. The investigational drug arimoclomol, which is in phase II/III clinical trials, is a well-characterized HSP amplifier and has been extensively clinically tested. Importantly, arimoclomol efficiently crosses the blood-brain-barrier presenting an opportunity to target the neurological manifestations of GD, which remains without a disease-modifying therapy. We used a range of biological and biochemical in vitro assays to assess the effect of arimoclomol on GCase activity in ex vivo systems of primary fibroblasts and neuronal-like cells from GD patients. We found that arimoclomol induced relevant HSPs such as ER-resident HSP70 (BiP) and enhanced the folding, maturation, activity, and correct cellular localization of mutated GCase across several genotypes including the common L444P and N370S mutations in primary cells from GD patients. These effects where recapitulated in a human neuronal model of GD obtained by differentiation of multipotent adult stem cells. These data demonstrate the potential of HSP-targeting therapies in GCase-deficiencies and strongly support the clinical development of arimoclomol as a potential therapeutic option for the neuronopathic forms of GD.

HSP70 treatment reversed lysosomal pathology in primary fibroblasts from 14 patients with eight different LSDs. HSP70 penetrated effectively into murine tissues including the CNS and inhibited glycosphingolipid accumulation in murine models of Fabry disease (Gla(-/-)), Sandhoff disease (Hexb(-/-)), and Niemann-Pick disease type C (Npc1(-/-)) and attenuated a wide spectrum of disease-associated neurological symptoms in Hexb(-/-) and Npc1(-/-) mice.

Using rat myoblast cultures, we found that up-regulation of the heat shock response with arimoclomol reduced key pathological markers of sIBM in vitro. Furthermore, in mutant valosin-containing protein (VCP) mice, which develop an inclusion body myopathy, treatment with arimoclomol ameliorated disease pathology and improved muscle function. We therefore evaluated arimoclomol in an investigator-led, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial in sIBM patients and showed that arimoclomol was safe and well tolerated.

Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, there is evidence for the involvement of proteasome dysfunction and heat shock proteins in the disease. We have previously shown that treatment with a co-inducer of the heat shock response called arimoclomol is effective in the SOD(G93A) mouse model of ALS, delaying disease progression and extending the lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice (Kieran et al. 2004). However, this previous study only examined the effects arimoclomol when treatment was initiated in pre- or early symptomatic stages of the disease. Clearly, to be of benefit to the majority of ALS patients, any therapy must be effective after symptom onset. In order to establish whether post-symptomatic treatment with arimoclomol is effective, in this study we carried out a systematic assessment of different treatment regimes in SOD(G93A) mice. Treatment with arimoclomol from early (75 days) or late (90 days) symptomatic stages significantly improved muscle function. Treatment from 75 days also significantly increased the lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice, although treatment from 90 days has no significant effect on lifespan. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression. Interestingly, this up-regulation in Hsp70 was accompanied by a decrease in the number of ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the spinal cord of treated SOD(G93A) mice, suggesting that arimoclomol directly effects protein aggregation and degradation.",

Arimoclomol has been found to be neuroprotective in a number of neurodegenerative disease models, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and in mutant Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) mice that model ALS, Arimoclomol rescues motor neurons, improves neuromuscular function and extends lifespan. The therapeutic potential of Arimoclomol is currently under investigation in a Phase II clinical trial for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. In this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by Arimoclomol and other inducers of the Heat Shock Response. ALS is a complex, multifactorial disease affecting a number of cell types and intracellular pathways. Cells and pathways affected by ALS pathology and which may be targeted by a heat shock protein-based therapy are also discussed in this review. For example, protein aggregation is a characteristic pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. Enhanced heat shock protein expression not only affects protein aggregation directly, but can also lead to more effective clearance of protein aggregates via the unfolded protein response, the proteasome-ubiquitin system or by autophagy. However, compounds such as Arimoclomol have effects beyond targeting protein mis-handling and can also affect additional pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress. Therefore, by targeting multiple pathological mechanisms, compounds such as Arimoclomol may be particularly effective in the development of a disease-modifying therapy for ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) mitigates against the accumulation of misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins and synaptic dysfunction, which is recognized as an early event in neurodegenerative diseases. Enhanced induction of a set of Hsps in differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells was observed following co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol, compared to their individual application. The dosages employed did not affect cell viability or neuronal process morphology. The induced Hsps included the little studied HSPA6 (Hsp70B'), a potentially neuroprotective protein that is present in the human genome but not in rat and mouse and hence is missing in current animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Enhanced induction of HSPA1A (Hsp70-1), DNAJB1 (Hsp40), HO-1 (Hsp32), and HSPB1 (Hsp27) was also observed. Celastrol activates heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of Hsp gene transcription, and also exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Arimoclomol is a co-activator that prolongs the binding of activated HSF1 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of inducible Hsp genes. Elevated Hsp levels peaked at 10 to 12 h for HSPA6, HSPA1A, DNAJB1, and HO-1 and at 24 h for HSPB1. Co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol induced higher Hsp levels compared to heat shock paired with arimoclomol. The co-application strategy of celastrol and arimoclomol targets multiple neurodegenerative disease-associated pathologies including protein misfolding and protein aggregation, inflammatory and oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction.",

Pathologically, the disease is defined by selective loss of spinal and bulbar motor neurons causing bulbar, facial and limb weakness. Although the precise disease pathophysiology is largely unknown, it appears to be related to abnormal accumulation of the pathogenic androgen receptor protein within the nucleus, leading to disruption of cellular processes. Using a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy that exhibits many of the characteristic features of the human disease, in vivo physiological assessment of muscle function revealed that mice with the pathogenic expansion of the androgen receptor develop a motor deficit characterized by a reduction in muscle force, abnormal muscle contractile characteristics, loss of functional motor units and motor neuron degeneration. We have previously shown that treatment with arimoclomol, a co-inducer of the heat shock stress response, delays disease progression in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal motor neuron disease. We therefore evaluated the therapeutic potential of arimoclomol in mice with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Arimoclomol was administered orally, in drinking water, from symptom onset and the effects established at 18 months of age, a late stage of disease. Arimoclomol significantly improved hindlimb muscle force and contractile characteristics, rescued motor units and, importantly, improved motor neuron survival and upregulated the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor which possess neurotrophic activity.

We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. STEF down-regulation also reduces perinuclear pMLC and decreases myosin-generated tension at the nuclear envelope, suggesting that STEF-mediated Rac1 activity regulates NMMIIB activity to promote stabilisation of the perinuclear actin cap.

During a 30-min incubation with dbcAMP, Rac1 activity gradually increased throughout the cells and remained at its maximal level. There was no change in PIP(3) concentration. After a 5-h incubation with dbcAMP, Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated at the protruding tips of neurites without PIP(3) accumulation. dbcAMP-induced Rac1 activation was principally mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) and Sif- and Tiam1-like exchange factor (STEF)/Tiam2. STEF depletion drastically reduced dbcAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. PKA phosphorylates STEF at three residues (Thr-749, Ser-782, Ser-1562); Thr-749 phosphorylation was critical for dbcAMP-induced Rac1 activation and neurite extension. During dbcAMP-induced neurite outgrowth, PKA activation at the plasma membrane became localized to neurite tips; this localization may contribute to local Rac1 activation at the same neurite tips.

Plasmalemmal TC10 activity decreased abruptly after cAMP addition in neuronal cells. TC10 was locally inactivated at extending neurite tips in cAMP-treated PC12 cells. TC10 depletion led to a decrease in cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. Constitutively active TC10 could not rescue this growth reduction, supporting our model for a role of GTP hydrolysis of TC10 in neuritogenesis by accelerating vesicle fusion. The cAMP-induced TC10 inactivation was mediated by PKA. Considering cAMP-induced RhoA inactivation, we found that p190B, but not p190A, mediated inactivation of TC10 and RhoA. Upon cAMP treatment, p190B was recruited to the plasma membrane. STEF depletion and Rac1-N17 expression reduced cAMP-induced TC10 inactivation.

For this investigation, a probable case was defined as onset of fever and generalized maculopapular rash, plus \u22651 of the following symptoms: Coryza, conjunctivitis, or cough. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case plus identification of measles-specific IgM in serum. For case-finding, we reviewed patients' medical records and conducted in-home patient examination. In a case-control study, we compared exposures of case-patients and controls matched by age and village of residence.

We found no statistically significant effects on vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral Doppler (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.49), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.14), or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.54). Subgroup analysis showed that these consolidated results were stable at different doses, different times to start of treatment, and different courses of treatment in all included RCTs. Sensitivity analysis showed that the STASH trial, which had a large population, did not influence the consolidated results of all three outcomes. Conclusions Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or all-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. We conclude that patients with SAH should not be treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of simvastatin versus placebo on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were delayed ischaemic deficit and delayed cerebral infarction. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model. Six RCTs involving 1053 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control intervention, simvastatin intervention had no influence on delayed ischaemic deficit (RR=0.99; 95% CI=0.78 to 1.27; P=0.96), delayed cerebral infarction (RR=1.17; 95% CI=0.60 to 2.29; P=0.65), mRS\u22642 (RR=0.97; 95% CI=0.87 to 1.09; P=0.61), vasospasm (RR=0.79; 95% CI=0.49 to 1.29; P=0.35), ICU stay (Std. mean difference=0.04; 95% CI=-0.54 to 0.63; P=0.88), hospital stay (Std. mean difference=0.01; 95% CI=-0.13 to 0.14; P=0.90) and mortality (RR=0.71; 95% CI=0.25 to 2.05; P=0.53) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

We present an update of recent literature on the current status of prevention and treatment strategies for DCI after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. A systematic literature search of three databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Embase) was performed. Human clinical trials assessing treatment strategies, published in the last 5 yr, were included based on full-text analysis. Study data were extracted using tables depicting study type, sample size, and outcome variables. We identified 49 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Clazosentan, magnesium, and simvastatin have been tested in large high-quality trials but failed to show a beneficial effect. Cilostazol, eicosapentaenoic acid, erythropoietin, heparin, and methylprednisolone yield promising results in smaller, non-randomized or retrospective studies and warrant further investigation. Topical application of nicardipine via implants after clipping has been shown to reduce clinical and angiographic vasospasm. Methods to improve subarachnoid blood clearance have been established, but their effect on outcome remains unclear. Haemodynamic management of DCI is evolving towards euvolaemic hypertension. Endovascular rescue therapies, such as percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial spasmolysis, are able to resolve angiographic vasospasm, but their effect on outcome needs to be proved. Many novel therapies for preventing and treating DCI after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage have been assessed, with variable results. Limitations of the study designs often preclude definite statements. Current evidence does not support prophylactic use of clazosentan, magnesium, or simvastatin. Many strategies remain to be tested in larger randomized controlled trials. This systematic review was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews. CRD42015019817.",

This study was designed as a prospective observational cohort study. Its subjects were aneurysmal SAH patients who had undergone aneurysm clipping or coiling. They were assigned to 1 of 3 groups : the 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg simvastatin groups. The primary end-point was the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm. The clinical outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score after 1 month and 3 months. The risk factors of the development of vasospasm were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Ninety nine patients with aneurysmal SAH were treated and screened. They were sequentially assigned to the 20 mg (n=22), 40 mg (n=34), and 80 mg (n=31) simvastatin groups. Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 36.4% of the 20 mg group, 8.8% of the 40 mg group, and 3.2% of the 80 mg group (p=0.003). The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that poor Hunt-Hess grades (OR=5.4 and 95% CI=1.09-26.62) and high-dose (80 mg) simvastatin (OR=0.09 and 95% CI=0.1-0.85) were independent factors of symptomatic vasospasm.

Two randomized placebo-controlled pilot trials that used the highest clinically approved dose of simvastatin (80 mg daily) gave positive results despite the fact that a lower dose of simvastatin (40 mg daily) did not improve clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that a high dose of 80 mg of simvastatin daily for 3 weeks would reduce the incidence of delayed ischemic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with a lower dose (40 mg of simvastatin daily) and lead to improved clinical outcomes. The study design was a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (presenting within 96 hours of the ictus) from 6 neurosurgical centers were recruited for 3 years. The primary outcome measure was the presence of delayed ischemic deficits, and secondary outcome measures included a modified Rankin disability score at 3 months and an analysis of cost-effectiveness.

The primary objective of this study was to determine acceptability of The Ottawa Rules app among emergency department clinicians. The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of publicity efforts on uptake of The Ottawa Rules app. The Ottawa Rules app was developed and publicly released for free on iOS and Android operating systems in April 2016. Local and national news and academic media coverage coincided with app release. This study was conducted at a large tertiary trauma care center in Ottawa, Canada. The study was advertised through posters and electronically by email. Emergency department clinicians were approached in person to enroll via in-app consent for a 1-month study during which time they were encouraged to use the app when evaluating patients with suspected knee, foot, or neck injuries. A 23-question survey was administered at the end of the study period via email to determine self-reported frequency, perceived ease of use of the app, and participant Technology Readiness Index scores. A total of 108 emergency department clinicians completed the study including 42 nurses, 33 residents, 20 attending physicians, and 13 medical students completing emergency department rotations. The median Technology Readiness Index for this group was 3.56, indicating a moderate degree of openness for technological adoption. The majority of survey respondents indicated favorable receptivity to the app including finding it helpful to applying the rules (73/108, 67.6%), that they would recommend the app to colleagues (81/108, 75.0%), and that they would continue using the app (73/108, 67.6%).

It is important to further investigate the LRAR and compare them with the already validated Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) to potentially curb healthcare costs and decrease unnecessary radiation exposure without compromising diagnostic accuracy. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 980 qualifying patients ages 12months to 18years presenting with ankle injury to a commonly staffed 310 bed children's hospital and auxiliary site pediatric emergency department. There were 28 high-risk fractures identified. The Ottawa Ankle Rules had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 87.7-100), specificity of 33.1% (95% CI 30.1-36.2), and would have reduced the number of ankle radiographs ordered by 32.1%.

The OARs met the criteria for radiographs in 100 of the 124 cases, of which 38 were actually referred for imaging. Based on radiographic findings in an acute setting, the OARs (n = 38) had a high sensitivity (.88) and are good predictors to rule out the presence of a fracture. Low specificity (0.00) results led to a high number of false positives and low positive predictive values (.18). When applied during the first hour after injury the OARs significantly overestimate the need for radiographs. However, a negative finding rules out the need to obtain radiographs.

In 193 patients with malleolar pain, the sensitivity for malleolar fracture (with 95% confidence intervals) was 100% (78-100%) and specificity was 45% (43-46%). In 24 patients with midfoot pain, sensitivity was 100% (65-100%) and specificity was 35% (21-49%). Thirty-five percent of radiographic series (76 of 217) were foregone for a cost savings of almost $6000. One hundred percent follow-up on those patients for whom x-rays were obtained found no missed fractures and they were subjectively satisfied with their care. The OAR reduced radiography in acute ankle/midfoot injury and saved money in relatively younger patients in the outpatient sports urgent care setting without missing any clinically significant fractures.

However, past work has not accounted for the diversity of functionally distinct cell types that make up the immune response. The aim of this study was to determine whether differences in the cellular composition of the immune infiltrate in breast tumours influence survival and treatment response, and whether these effects differ by molecular subtype. We applied an established computational approach (CIBERSORT) to bulk gene expression profiles of almost 11,000 tumours to infer the proportions of 22 subsets of immune cells. We investigated associations between each cell type and survival and response to chemotherapy, modelling cellular proportions as quartiles. We found that tumours with little or no immune infiltration were associated with different survival patterns according to oestrogen receptor (ER) status. In ER-negative disease, tumours lacking immune infiltration were associated with the poorest prognosis, whereas in ER-positive disease, they were associated with intermediate prognosis. Of the cell subsets investigated, T regulatory cells and M0 and M2 macrophages emerged as the most strongly associated with poor outcome, regardless of ER status. Among ER-negative tumours, CD8+ T cells (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p = 0.02) and activated memory T cells (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97; p = 0.01) were associated with favourable outcome. T follicular helper cells (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.57; p &lt; 0.001) and memory B cells (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.0-1.39; p = 0.04) were associated with pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative disease, suggesting a role for humoral immunity in mediating response to cytotoxic therapy. Unsupervised clustering analysis using immune cell proportions revealed eight subgroups of tumours, largely defined by the balance between M0, M1, and M2 macrophages, with distinct survival patterns by ER status and associations with patient age at diagnosis. The main limitations of this study are the use of diverse platforms for measuring gene expression, including some not previously used with CIBERSORT, and the combined analysis of different forms of follow-up across studies. Large differences in the cellular composition of the immune infiltrate in breast tumours appear to exist, and these differences are likely to be important determinants of both prognosis and response to treatment. In particular, macrophages emerge as a possible target for novel therapies. Detailed analysis of the cellular immune response in tumours has the potential to enhance clinical prediction and to identify candidates for immunotherapy.",

Germline APOBEC3B deletion is more common in East Asian women and confers a modest risk to breast cancer in both East Asian and Caucasian women. Analysis of tumour samples from women of European descent has shown that germline APOBEC3B deletion is associated with an increased propensity to develop somatic mutations and with an enrichment for immune response-related gene sets. However, this has not been examined in Asian tumour samples, where population differences in genetic and dietary factors may have an impact on the immune system. In this study, we determined the prevalence of germline APOBEC3B deletion and its association with breast cancer risk in a cross-sectional hospital-based Asian multi-ethnic cohort of 1451 cases and 1442 controls from Malaysia. We compared gene expression profiles of breast cancers arising from APOBEC3B deletion carriers and non-carriers using microarray analyses. Finally, we characterised the overall abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells in breast cancers from TCGA and METABRIC using ESTIMATE and relative frequency of 22 immune cell subsets in breast cancers from METABRIC using CIBERSORT. The minor allelic frequency of APOBEC3B deletion was estimated to be 0.35, 0.42 and 0.16 in female populations of Chinese, Malay and Indian descent, respectively, and that germline APOBEC3B deletion was associated with breast cancer risk with odds ratios of 1.23 (95 % CI: [1.05, 1.44]) for one-copy deletion and 1.38 (95 % CI: [1.10, 1.74]) for two-copy deletion compared to women with no deletion. Germline APOBEC3B deletion was not associated with any clinicopathologic features or the expression of any APOBEC family members but was associated with immune response-related gene sets (FDR q values &lt; 0.05). Analysis of breast cancers from METABRIC revealed breast cancers from APOBEC3B deletion carriers to have significantly higher abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (P &lt; 0.001). Taken together, our data suggests that tumour-infiltrating immune cells may be an important feature of breast cancers arising in women with APOBEC3B germline deletion, and that this may be of particular interest in Asian women where the germline deletion is more common.",

While a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking. Here we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific DNAse Hypersensitive Site (DHS) information from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap to construct an improved reference DNA methylation database. We show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. We conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. Instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. We call the combined algorithm which uses DHS data and robust partial correlations for inference, EpiDISH (Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample Heterogeneity). Finally, we demonstrate the added value of EpiDISH in an EWAS of smoking. Estimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in EWAS may benefit from the use of non-constrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.",

We hypothesized that since cytotoxic T cells release cytolytic proteins such as perforin (PRF1) and pro-apoptotic granzymes (GZMA) to attack cancer cells, a cytolytic activity score (CYT) would be a useful tool to assess anticancer immunity. Genomic expression data were obtained from 456 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CYT was defined by GZMA and PRF1 expression, and CIBERSORT was used to evaluate intratumoral immune cell composition. High CYT was associated with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), as well as high levels of activated memory CD4+T cells, gamma-delta T cells, and M1 macrophages. CYT-high CRC patients had improved overall survival (p = 0.019) and disease-free survival (p = 0.016) compared with CYT-low CRC patients, especially in TIL-positive tumors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CYT- high associates with improved survival independently after controlling for age, lymphovascular invasion, colonic location, microsatellite instability, and TIL positivity. The levels of immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs)-programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM3), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)-correlated significantly with CYT (p &lt; 0.0001); with improved survival in CYT-high and ICM-low patients, and poorer survival in ICM-high patients. High CYT within CRC is associated with improved survival, likely due to increased immunity and cytolytic activity of T cells and M1 macrophages. High CYT is also associated with high expression of ICMs; thus, further studies to elucidate the role of CYT as a predictive biomarker of the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade are warranted.",

New insights into the role of tumor-infiltrating immune cells suggest that their composition, as well as their functionality, might serve as a biomarker to enable optimal patient selection for current systemic therapies and upcoming treatment options such as immunotherapy. We performed several complementary unbiased in silico analyses on gene expression profiles of 7270 unrelated tumor samples of nonmetastatic breast cancer patients with known clinical follow-up. CIBERSORT was used to estimate the fraction of 22 immune cell types to study their relations with pathological complete response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). In addition, we used four previously reported immune gene signatures and a CD8+ T-cell exhaustion signature to assess their relationships with breast cancer outcome. Multivariable binary logistic regression and multivariable Cox regression were used to assess the association of immune cell-type fractions and immune signatures with pCR and DFS/OS, respectively. Increased fraction of regulatory T-cells in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors was associated with a lower pCR rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03 to 0.69), as well as shorter DFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.23 to 7.98) and OS (HR = 7.69, 95% CI = 3.43 to 17.23). A higher fraction of M0 macrophages in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors was associated with worse DFS (HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.33) and, in ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors, with worse OS (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.61). Increased fractions of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells in all breast cancer patients related to a higher pCR rate (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.01 to 2.38), prolonged DFS (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.98), and, in HER2-positive tumors, with prolonged OS (HR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.73).

The composition of relevant immune cell types frequently differed per breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, a high CD8+ T-cell exhaustion signature score was associated with shortened DFS in patients with ER-positive tumors regardless of HER2 status (HR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.07 to 3.04).

Immunohistochemical analysis of patient samples confirmed the reduced frequency of mast cells in human HCC tumor tissue as compared to tumor adjacent tissue. Our data demonstrate that deconvolution of gene expression data by CIBERSORT provides valuable information about immune cell composition of HCC patients.",

Considering the fact that immune responses are heterogenous and that the clinical outcome could be influenced by the interplay of various immune cell types, it is imperative to evaluate multiple intra-tumoral immune cell types in the same set of patients. <b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the individual and combined effects of diverse intra-tumoral immune cell types on recurrence after complete surgical resection in early stage lung adenocarcinoma. <b>Methods:</b> We obtained NCBI GEO datasets for lung adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent histological subtype of NSCLC and re-analyzed the gene expression data of 292 patients with early stage cancer (IA/IB). CIBERSORT was used to resolve 22 immune cell types from the tumor transcriptomes. Survival analysis was carried out to assess the effect of immune cell types and genes associated with recurrence. <b>Results:</b> Out of the 22 cell types, a high proportion of Tregs and monocyte-macrophages in the tumors were associated with significantly increased probability of recurrence. Conversely, increased proportion of non-Treg CD4+ T cells and plasma cells were associated with a lower probability of recurrence. The higher expression of <i>CCL20</i> (which can direct the migration of cells of B cell lineage), <i>XCL1</i> (associated with prototypical Th1 responses) and the immunoglobulin chains <i>IGHV4.34</i> and <i>IGLV6.57</i> were associated with a significantly lower probability of recurrence. Importantly, the intra-tumoral immune phenotype comprising these four cell types varied among patients and differentially associated with recurrence depending on net levels of positive and negative prognostic factors. Despite a high level of intra-tumoral plasma cells, a concomitant high level of monocyte-macrophages reduced the freedom from recurrence from ~80 to ~50% at 80 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, stratification of the patients on the basis of a score estimated from the levels of four cell types enabled the identification of patients with significantly increased probability of recurrence (~50%) after surgery. <b>Significance:</b> Our analysis suggests that concomitant levels of macrophages and plasma cells, in addition to the T regs and non-TregCD4+ T cells in tumors can identify patients with early stage lung cancer at greater risk of recurrence.",

The approval was granted by the US FDA under its Accelerated Approval Program based on the results of the JGDG phase II trial (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01185964\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01185964</a>). In addition, the EMA granted conditional approval for olaratumab in this indication in November 2016 following a review under the EMA's Accelerated Assessment Program. An international, confirmatory phase III trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma is ongoing (ANNOUNCE; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02451943\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02451943</a>). Olaratumab has also been investigated in phase II trials in several other cancers. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of olaratumab leading to this first approval, for use in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults.",

Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody that has antitumour activity in human sarcoma xenografts. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaratumab plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. We did an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 study of doxorubicin plus olaratumab treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma at 16 clinical sites in the USA. For both the phase 1b and phase 2 parts of the study, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma not previously treated with an anthracycline, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, and available tumour tissue to determine PDGFR\u03b1 expression by immunohistochemistry. In the phase 2 part of the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either olaratumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1 and day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)) or doxorubicin alone (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to eight cycles. Randomisation was dynamic and used the minimisation randomisation technique. The phase 1b primary endpoint was safety and the phase 2 primary endpoint was progression-free survival using a two-sided \u03b1 level of 0.2 and statistical power of 0.8. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01185964\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01185964</a>. 15 patients were enrolled and treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin in the phase 1b study, and 133 patients were randomised (66 to olaratumab plus doxorubicin; 67 to doxorubicin alone) in the phase 2 trial, 129 (97%) of whom received at least one dose of study treatment (64 received olaratumab plus doxorubicin, 65 received doxorubicin). Median progression-free survival in phase 2 was 6.6 months (95% CI 4.1-8.3) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 4.1 months (2.8-5.4) with doxorubicin (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 0.44-1.02, p=0.0615). Median overall survival was 26.5 months (20.9-31.7) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 14.7 months (9.2-17.1) with doxorubicin (stratified HR 0.46, 0.30-0.71, p=0.0003). The objective response rate was 18.2% (9.8-29.6) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 11.9% (5.3-22.2) with doxorubicin (p=0.3421). Steady state olaratumab serum concentrations were reached during cycle 3 with mean maximum and trough concentrations ranging from 419 \u03bcg/mL (geometric coefficient of variation in percentage [CV%] 26.2) to 487 \u03bcg/mL (CV% 33.0) and from 123 \u03bcg/mL (CV% 31.2) to 156 \u03bcg/mL (CV% 38.0), respectively. Adverse events that were more frequent with olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone included neutropenia (37 [58%] vs 23 [35%]), mucositis (34 [53%] vs 23 [35%]), nausea (47 [73%] vs 34 [52%]), vomiting (29 [45%] vs 12 [18%]), and diarrhoea (22 [34%] vs 15 [23%]). Febrile neutropenia of grade 3 or higher was similar in both groups (olaratumab plus doxorubicin: eight [13%] of 64 patients vs doxorubicin: nine [14%] of 65 patients). This study of olaratumab with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma met its predefined primary endpoint for progression-free survival and achieved a highly significant improvement of 11.8 months in median overall survival, suggesting a potential shift in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), encoded by TNF-\u03b1 gene has an important role in the apoptotic mechanisms of autoimmune diseases. Recently, TNF-\u03b1 polymorphisms and autoimmune/psychiatric disorders have been reported to be related. In this regard, we focused on to investigate a possible relation between the TNF-\u03b1 gene promoter region-308 G/A and - 850 C/T polymorphisms and PANDAS. In this study, ages of PANDAS patient and control groups were ranging from 4 years to 12-year-old. Patient group includes childhood onset PANDAS patients (n = 42) and control group includes healthy children (n = 58). Diagnoses have been carried out according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV) criteria with Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime (KSAD-S-PL) and Children Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Moreover, PANDAS criteria established by the American National Psychiatry Institute have been employed for diagnoses. For identifying polymorphisms; Polymerase Chain Reaction, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and Polyacrylamid Gel Electrophoresis were used. For -308 polymorphism, 37 of 42 PANDAS patients' results and for -850 C/T polymorphism, 38 of 42 PANDAS patients' results were obtained. According to our statistical analysis there is a positive relationship between PANDAS patients for -308 G/A polymorphism but not for -850 C/T polymorphism. There is no positive relationship between -308 G/A polymorphism and antistrep-tolysin O (ASO) titers and no relationship between -850 C/T polymorphism and ASO titers. We found, however, positive relationship between genders of patients (boys) and the disease. According to our results, we propose that the AA polymorphism of -308 G/A polymorphism can be used as a molecular indicator for PANDAS.",

Seventy-seven consecutive patients (59 males, 18 females; mean age 6.3\u00b12.5 years, range 2.0-14.5 years) strictly fulfilling the clinical criteria for PANDAS diagnosis were recruited. In all subjects we evaluated serum concentrations of free-T3, free-T4, thyrotropin, and the following auto-antibodies: anti-thyroperoxidase, anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyrotropin receptor, anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium, anti-tissue transglutaminase, anti-nuclear, anti-smooth muscle, anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-phospholipid, plus lupus-like anticoagulant. The results were compared with those obtained from 197 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (130 males, 67 females; mean age 6.8\u00b12.9 years, range 2.3-14.8 years). The frequencies of subclinical (3.8% vs 3.6%) and overt hypothyroidism (1.2% vs 0%), autoimmune thyroiditis (2.46% vs 1.14%), celiac disease (1.2% vs 0.05%), and positivity of organ- and nonorgan-specific autoantibodies (5.1% vs 4.8%) were not statistically significant between patients with PANDAS and controls. Evaluating the overall disease duration, we did not observe any significant difference between patients with (3.4\u00b12.15 years) and without (3.4\u00b12.89 years) autoimmune abnormalities. However, PANDAS patients with autoimmune diseases or positivity for any organ- and nonorgan-specific antibodies showed significantly higher anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNAse B titers, as well as a history of more frequent throat infections than controls (p&lt;0.0001). Abnormalities of thyroid function and thyroid autoimmune diseases, as well as the association with celiac disease or organ- and nonorgan-specific autoimmunity seem not more frequent in children and adolescents with PANDAS than in healthy controls. A potential relationship between autoimmunity and PANDAS should be assessed further in larger studies.

Of recent interest, a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders known collectively as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS) is believed to be secondary to central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity that occurs in relation to group A streptococcal infection. Thus, we hypothesized that a sample of children with OCD and/or tics would have an increased maternal risk for an autoimmune response relative to population norms. We also expected maternal prevalence of various autoimmune diseases to be higher among those participants that met the putative criteria for PANDAS. We examined, via structured interview, the medical history of the biological mothers of 107 children with OCD and/or tics. Autoimmune disorders were reported in 17.8% of study mothers, which is significantly greater than the general prevalence among women in the United States (approximately 5%). Further, study mothers were more likely to report having an autoimmune disease if their children were considered \"likely PANDAS\" cases versus \"unlikely PANDAS\" cases. The results offer preliminary support for hypothesized links between maternal autoimmune disease and both OCD/tics and PANDAS in youth. Further research is necessary to clarify these general associations; links to specific autoimmune disease; and relevance of autoimmune disease in other family members (e.g., fathers).",

Moreover, longitudinal retrospective studies suggest that a recent exposure to GABHS might be a risk factor for the onset of tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. However, further evidence from longitudinal prospective research is needed to verify whether a temporal association between GABHS infections and symptom exacerbations is a useful and reliable criterion for the diagnosis of PANDAS. In addition, preliminary results suggest that the PANDAS spectrum might be enlarged to include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although a number of immunological biomarkers have been proposed as markers of the PANDAS variant, at present, none of these has been conclusively proved useful to diagnose and monitor disease course in children with a suspicion of PANDAS. Finally, despite their empirical use in community settings, we still lack conclusive, evidence-based data regarding the usefulness of antibiotic and immunomodulatory treatments in children with PANDAS.

Despite the insertion of vast amounts of additional membrane, the phagosomal surface area remains approximately constant, implying active ongoing fission. To investigate the mechanisms underlying phagosomal fission we monitored the fate of Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR), which are known to be cleared from the phagosome during maturation. FcgammaR, which show a continuous distribution throughout the membrane of nascent phagosomes were found at later times to cluster into punctate, vesicular structures, before disappearing. In situ photoactivation of receptors tagged with a light-sensitive fluorescent protein revealed that some of these vesicles detach, whereas others remain associated with the phagosome. By fusing FcgammaR to pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins, we observed that the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors enters an acidic compartment, indicative of inward budding and formation of multivesicular structures. The topology of the receptor was confirmed by flow cytometry of purified phagosomes. Phagosomal proteins are ubiquitylated, and ubiquitylation was found to be required for formation of acidic multivesicular structures. Remarkably, proteasomal function is also involved in the vesiculation process. Preventing the generation of multivesicular structures did not impair the acquisition of late endosomal and lysosomal markers, indicating that phagosomal fusion and fission are controlled separately.",

Ubiquitination often leads to the alteration of protein stability, subcellular localization, or interaction with other proteins. Given the importance of ubiquitination in the regulation of host immunity, it is not surprising that many infectious agents have evolved strategies to interfere with the ubiquitination network with sophisticated mechanisms such as functional mimicry. The facultative intracellular pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. <i>L. pneumophila</i> is phagocytosed by macrophages and is able to replicate within a niche called Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The biogenesis of LCV is dependent upon the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system which delivers more than 330 effector proteins into host cytosol. The optimal intracellular replication of <i>L. pneumophila</i> requires the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. Furthermore, membranes of the bacterial phagosome are enriched with ubiquitinated proteins in a way that requires its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system, suggesting the involvement of effectors in the manipulation of the host ubiquitination machinery.

The disease is vaccine preventable and eradication of the virus is considered feasible, in principle. However, a herd immunity exceeding 95% is required to prevent sporadic viral outbreaks in a population. Declining disease prevalence, combined with public anxiety over the vaccination's safety, has led to increased vaccine refusal, especially in Europe. This has led to the resurgence of measles in some areas. This article discusses whether synergizing effective measles therapeutics with the measles vaccination could contribute to finally eradicating measles. The authors identify key elements in a desirable drug profile and review current disease management strategies and the state of experimental inhibitor candidates. The authors also evaluate the risk associated with viral escape from inhibition, and consider the potential of measles therapeutics in the management of persistent central nervous system (CNS) viral infection. Finally, the authors contemplate the possible impact of therapeutics in controlling the threat imposed by closely related zoonotic pathogens of the same genus as measles. Efficacious therapeutics used for post-exposure prophylaxis of high-risk social contacts of confirmed index cases may aid measles eradication by closing herd immunity gaps; this is due to vaccine refusal or failure in populations with overall good vaccination coverage. The envisioned primarily prophylactic application of measles therapeutics to a predominantly pediatric and/or adolescent population, dictates the drug profile.

The A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are among the most prominent sheddases, being widely expressed in many tissues, frequently overexpressed in cancer, and promiscuously cleaving diverse substrates. It is increasingly clear that the proteolytic shedding of transmembrane receptors impacts pathophysiology and drug response. Receptor substrates of sheddases include the cytokine receptors TNFR1 and IL6R; the Notch receptors; type-I and -III TGF\u03b2 receptors; receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as HER2, HER4, and VEGFR2; and, in particular, MET and TAM-family RTKs AXL and Mer (MerTK). Activation of receptor shedding by mechanical cues, hypoxia, radiation, and phosphosignaling offers insight into mechanisms of drug resistance. This particularly holds for kinase inhibitors targeting BRAF (such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK (such as trametinib and cobimetinib), along with direct sheddase inhibitors.

In the present study, we demonstrate that AXL, but not TYRO3 or MERTK, is efficiently and sequentially cleaved by \u03b1- and \u03b3-secretases in various types of cancer cell lines. Proteolytic processing of AXL redirected signaling toward a secretase-mediated pathway, away from the classic, well-known, ligand-dependent canonical RTK signaling pathway. The AXL intracellular domain cleavage product, but not full-length AXL, was further shown to translocate into the nucleus <i>via</i> a nuclear localization sequence that harbored a basic HRRKK motif.

In this chapter, we first provide a comprehensive review of the structure, regulation, biologic functions, and downstream signaling pathways of these receptors. In addition, we discuss recent evidence which suggests a role for TAM receptors in oncogenic mechanisms as family members are overexpressed in a spectrum of human cancers and have prognostic significance in some. Possible strategies for targeted inhibition of the TAM family in the treatment of human cancer are described. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the full clinical implications of TAM family expression and activation in cancer.",

Rather than functioning as oncogenic drivers, their induction in tumour cells predominately promotes survival, chemoresistance and motility. The unique mode of maximal activation of this RTK family requires an extracellular lipid\u2013protein complex. For example, the protein ligand, growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6), binds to phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) that is externalized on apoptotic cell membranes, which activates MERTK on macrophages. This triggers engulfment of apoptotic material and subsequent anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. In tumours, autocrine and paracrine ligands and apoptotic cells are abundant, which provide a survival signal to the tumour cell and favour an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive microenvironment. Thus, TAM kinase inhibition could stimulate antitumour immunity, reduce tumour cell survival, enhance chemosensitivity and diminish metastatic potential.",

Gas6 was cloned and characterized in 1993 and found to be similar to the plasma anticoagulant protein S. Soon after it was recognized as a growth factor-like molecule, as it interacted with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the TAM family; Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK. Since then, the role of Gas6, protein S, and the TAM receptors has been found to be important in inflammation, hemostasis, and cancer, making this system an interesting target in biomedicine. Gas6 employs a unique mechanism of action, interacting through its vitamin K-dependent Gla module with phosphatidylserine-containing membranes and through its carboxy-terminal LG domains with the TAM membrane receptors.

We report the synthesis of several series of purine analogues of BMS-777607. The structural diversity of the designed inhibitors was expected to modify the interactions formed in the binding site and consequently to modulate their selectivity profiles. The most potent inhibitor 6g exhibits Kds of 39, 42, 65 and 200 nM against Axl, Mer, Met and Tyro3 respectively. Analysis of the affinity of 6g for active and inactive forms of Abl1, an RTK protein that does not belong to the TAM subfamily, together with the binding modes of 6g predicted by docking studies, indicates that 6g displays some selectivity for the TAM family and may act as a type II inhibitor.",

Macrophages are one of the key mediators which regulate the progress of hepatic inflammation. Increasing evidence shows that the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) family of RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), which is expressed in macrophages, alleviates inflammatory responses through a negative feedback loop. However, the functional contribution of each TAM family member to the progression of hepatic inflammation remains elusive. In this study, we explore the role of individual TAM family proteins during autophagy induction and evaluate their contribution to hepatic inflammation. Among the TAM family of RTKs, AXL (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase) only induces autophagy in macrophages after interaction with its ligand, GAS6 (growth arrest specific 6). Based on our results, autophosphorylation of 2 tyrosine residues (Tyr815 and Tyr860) in the cytoplasmic domain of AXL in mice is required for autophagy induction and AXL-mediated autophagy induction is dependent on MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)14 activity. Furthermore, induction of AXL-mediated autophagy prevents CASP1 (caspase 1)-dependent IL1B (interleukin 1, \u03b2) and IL18 (interleukin 18) maturation by inhibiting NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation. In agreement with these observations, axl<sup>-/-</sup> mice show more severe symptoms than do wild-type (Axl<sup>+/+</sup>) mice following acute hepatic injury induced by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>). Hence, GAS6-AXL signaling-mediated autophagy induction in murine macrophages ameliorates hepatic inflammatory responses by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

As the most abundant protein in the body, collagen is essential to maintain the normal structure and strength of connective tissue, such as bones, skin, cartilage, and blood vessels. Mammals, birds, and fish can synthesize: (1) glycine from threonine, serine, choline, and Hyp; (2) proline from arginine; and (3) Hyp from proline residues in collagen, in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. In addition, livestock (e.g., pigs, cattle, and sheep) produces proline from glutamine and glutamate in the small intestine, but this pathway is absent from birds and possibly most fish species. Results of the recent studies indicate that endogenous synthesis of glycine, proline, and Hyp is inadequate for maximal growth, collagen production, or feed efficiency in pigs, chickens, and fish. Although glycine, proline and Hyp, and gelatin can be used as feed additives in animal diets, these ingredients except for glycine are relatively expensive, which precludes their inclusion in practical rations. Alternatively, hydrolyzed feather meal (HFM), which contains 9% glycine, 5% Hyp, and 12% proline, holds great promise as a low cost but abundant dietary source of glycine, Hyp, and proline for ruminants and nonruminants. Because HFM is deficient in most AAs, future research efforts should be directed at improving the bioavailability of its AAs and the balance of AAs in HFM-supplemented diets. Finally, HFM may be used as a feed additive to prevent or ameliorate connective tissue disorders in domestic and aquatic animals.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18288197": "Phosphoinositides are a family of lipid signalling molecules that regulate many cellular functions in eukaryotes. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2), the central component in the phosphoinositide signalling circuitry, is generated primarily by type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIPKIalpha, PIPKIbeta and PIPKIgamma). In addition to functions in the cytosol, phosphoinositides are present in the nucleus, where they modulate several functions; however, the mechanism by which they directly regulate nuclear functions remains unknown. PIPKIs regulate cellular functions through interactions with protein partners, often PtdIns4,5P2 effectors, that target PIPKIs to discrete subcellular compartments, resulting in the spatial and temporal generation of PtdIns4,5P2 required for the regulation of specific signalling pathways. Therefore, to determine roles for nuclear PtdIns4,5P2 we set out to identify proteins that interacted with the nuclear PIPK, PIPKIalpha. Here we show that PIPKIalpha co-localizes at nuclear speckles and interacts with a newly identified non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, which we have termed Star-PAP (nuclear speckle targeted PIPKIalpha regulated-poly(A) polymerase) and that the activity of Star-PAP can be specifically regulated by PtdIns4,5P2. Star-PAP and PIPKIalpha function together in a complex to control the expression of select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding the key cytoprotective enzyme haem oxygenase-1 (refs 8, 9) and other oxidative stress response genes by regulating the 3'-end formation of their mRNAs. Taken together, the data demonstrate a model by which phosphoinositide signalling works in tandem with complement pathways to regulate the activity of Star-PAP and the subsequent biosynthesis of its target mRNA. The results reveal a mechanism for the integration of nuclear phosphoinositide signals and a method for regulating gene expression.",

These associated kinases act as coactivators of Star-PAP that regulates its activity and specificity toward mRNAs, yet the mechanism of control of these interactions are not defined. We identified a phosphorylated residue (serine 6, S6) on Star-PAP in the zinc finger region, the domain required for PIPKI\u03b1 interaction. We show that S6 is phosphorylated by CKI\u03b1 within the nucleus which is required for Star-PAP nuclear retention and interaction with PIPKI\u03b1. Unlike the CKI\u03b1 mediated phosphorylation at the catalytic domain, Star-PAP S6 phosphorylation is insensitive to oxidative stress suggesting a signal mediated regulation of CKI\u03b1 activity.

Visual snow is a persistent visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots throughout the visual field. Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous \"double-pulse\" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response. We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (N = 5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine. In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls. These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.",

In the last 4 years, this has grown to approximately 200 cases and there has been a concentrated effort to better understand and characterize this condition. It has become apparent that patients who see visual snow frequently have additional visual and non-visual symptoms, and the consistency of these symptoms has led to proposed criteria for visual snow syndrome. When seeing a patient with visual snow, it is important to rule out a possible underlying secondary etiology.

Sixty percent of patients with VSS also experience migraine, with or without aura. This entity often is considered psychogenic in nature, to the detriment of the patient's best interests, but the high frequency of similar visual symptoms argues for an organic deficit. The purpose of this review is to clarify VSS as a true entity and elaborate the nature of individual symptoms and their relationship to each other. The literature was reviewed with specific regard to the clinical presentation and psychophysical, neurophysiological, and functional imaging studies in patients with defined visual disturbances that comprise VSS. Consideration of the individual symptoms suggests that multiple factors are potentially involved in the development of VSS, including subcortical network malfunction and cortical hyperexcitation. Although there is substantial overlap between VSS and migraine syndromes in terms of co-occurring symptoms, both neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies provide substantial evidence of separate abnormalities of processing, supporting these as separate syndromes. VSS is likely associated with either hyperactive visual cortices or, alternatively, impaired processing of simultaneous afferent information projecting to cortex. VSS likely results from widespread disturbance of sensory processing resulting in sensory misperception. There may be a number of syndromes associated with impaired sensory processing resulting in sensory misperception, including migraine, persistent perceptual postural dizziness, and tinnitus, which overlap with VSS.

FfIBP is an ice-binding protein encoded by the Antarctic bacterium Flavobacterium frigoris PS1. The X-ray crystal structure of FfIBP was determined to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution to gain insight into its ice-binding mechanism. The refined structure of FfIBP shows an intramolecular disulfide bond, and analytical ultracentrifugation and analytical size-exclusion chromatography show that it behaves as a monomer in solution. Sequence alignments and structural comparisons of IBPs allowed two groups of IBPs to be defined, depending on sequence differences between the \u03b12 and \u03b14 loop regions and the presence of the disulfide bond. Although FfIBP closely resembles Leucosporidium (recently re-classified as Glaciozyma) IBP (LeIBP) in its amino-acid sequence, the thermal hysteresis (TH) activity of FfIBP appears to be tenfold higher than that of LeIBP. A comparison of the FfIBP and LeIBP structures reveals that FfIBP has different ice-binding residues as well as a greater surface area in the ice-binding site. Notably, the ice-binding site of FfIBP is composed of a T-A/G-X-T/N motif, which is similar to the ice-binding residues of hyperactive antifreeze proteins. Thus, it is proposed that the difference in TH activity between FfIBP and LeIBP may arise from the amino-acid composition of the ice-binding site, which correlates with differences in affinity and surface complementarity to the ice crystal.

However, their use was largely hampered by the lack of the large-scale recombinant production system. In this study, the codon-optimized IBP from Leucosporidium sp. (LeIBP) was constructed and subjected to high-level expression in methylotrophic Pichia pastoris system. In a laboratory-scale fermentation (7 L), the optimal induction temperature and pH were determined to be 25 \u00b0C and 6.0, respectively. Further, employing glycerol fed-batch phase prior to methanol induction phase enhanced the production of recombinant LelBP (rLeIBP) by \u223c100 mg/l. The total amount of secreted proteins at these conditions (25 \u00b0C, pH 6.0, and glycerol fed-batch phase) was \u223c443 mg/l, 60 % of which was rLeIBP, yielding \u223c272 mg/l. In the pilot-scale fermentation (700 L) under the same conditions, the yield of rLeIBP was 300 mg/l. To our best knowledge, this result reports the highest production yield of the recombinant IBP. More importantly, the rLeIBP secreted into culture media was stable and active for 6 days of fermentation. The thermal hysteresis (TH) activity of rLeIBP was about 0.42 \u00b0C, which is almost the same to those reported previously. The availability of large quantities of rLeIBP may accelerate further application studies.",

LeIBP is a member of a large class of ice-binding proteins, the structures of which are unknown. Here, we report the crystal structures of non-glycosylated LeIBP and glycosylated LeIBP at 1.57- and 2.43-\u00c5 resolution, respectively. Structural analysis of the LeIBPs revealed a dimeric right-handed \u03b2-helix fold, which is composed of three parts: a large coiled structural domain, a long helix region (residues 96-115 form a long \u03b1-helix that packs along one face of the \u03b2-helix), and a C-terminal hydrophobic loop region ((243)PFVPAPEVV(251)). Unexpectedly, the C-terminal hydrophobic loop region has an extended conformation pointing away from the body of the coiled structural domain and forms intertwined dimer interactions. In addition, structural analysis of glycosylated LeIBP with sugar moieties attached to Asn(185) provides a basis for interpreting previous biochemical analyses as well as the increased stability and secretion of glycosylated LeIBP. We also determined that the aligned Thr/Ser/Ala residues are critical for ice binding within the B face of LeIBP using site-directed mutagenesis. Although LeIBP has a common \u03b2-helical fold similar to that of canonical hyperactive antifreeze proteins, the ice-binding site is more complex and does not have a simple ice-binding motif. In conclusion, we could identify the ice-binding site of LeIBP and discuss differences in the ice-binding modes compared with other known antifreeze proteins and ice-binding proteins.",

Owing to their unique characteristics, IBPs have been studied for applications in food, pharmaceuticals, and medicine, as well as from a general scientific point of view. In this study, we have used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Raman spectroscopy as tools to understand the ice binding activity of the Arctic-yeast-originating extracellular ice binding glycoprotein (LeIBP) isolated from Leucosporidium sp. AY30. From the DSC results, an increase in the specific heat capacity was confirmed for 1 mg/mL LeIBP, which suggested that additional heat flow was required for the change in temperature. In addition, the temperature corresponding to the phase change of the solution was measured, and Raman spectroscopy was carried out on the frozen and molten phases, respectively. From the results of Raman analysis, we confirmed that the helical vibrations related to the ice binding sites on LeIBP were dramatically suppressed when the LeIBP solution was frozen. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) of the Raman spectra yielded the contrast factor between the freezing and melting states. Both DSC and Raman spectroscopy are widely used to study the ice binding activity and the structural changes associated with molecular vibrations in cryobiology.",

BSCR is also associated with endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), an enzyme involved in processing HLA class I ligands, thus implicating the A*29:02 peptidome in this disease. To investigate the relationship between both risk factors we employed label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the effects of ERAP2 on the A*29:02-bound peptidome. An ERAP2-negative cell line was transduced with lentiviral constructs containing GFP-ERAP2 or GFP alone, and the A*29:02 peptidomes from both transduced cells were compared. A similar analysis was performed with two additional A*29:02-positive, ERAP1-concordant, cell lines expressing or not ERAP2. In both comparisons the presence of ERAP2 affected the following features of the A*29:02 peptidome: 1) Length, with increased amounts of peptides &gt;9-mers, and 2) N-terminal residues, with less ERAP2-susceptible and more hydrophobic ones. The paradoxical effects on peptide length suggest that unproductive binding to ERAP2 might protect some peptides from ERAP1 over-trimming. The influence on N-terminal residues can be explained by a direct effect of ERAP2 on trimming, without ruling out and improved processing in concert with ERAP1. The alterations in the A*29:02 peptidome suggest that the association of ERAP2 with BSCR is through its effects on peptide processing. These differ from those on the ankylosing spondylitis-associated HLA-B*27. Thus, ERAP2 alters the peptidome of distinct HLA molecules as a function of their specific binding preferences, influencing different pathological outcomes in an allele-dependent way.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102239": " Use of wearable ECG devices for arrhythmia screening is limited due to poor signal quality, small number of leads and short records, leading to incorrect recognition of pathological events. This paper introduces a novel approach to classification (normal/'N', atrial fibrillation/'A', other/'O', and noisy/'P') of short single-lead ECGs recorded by wearable devices. Various rhythm and morphology features are derived from the separate beats ('local' features) as well as the entire ECGs ('global' features) to represent short-term events and general trends respectively. Various types of atrial and ventricular activity, heart beats and, finally, ECG records are then recognised by a multi-level approach combining a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and threshold-based rules. The proposed features are suitable for the recognition of 'A'. The method is robust due to the noise estimation involved. A combination of radial and linear SVMs ensures both high predictive performance and effective generalisation. Cost-sensitive learning, genetic algorithm feature selection and thresholding improve overall performance. The generalisation ability and reliability of this approach are high, as verified by cross-validation on a training set and by blind testing, with only a slight decrease of overall F1-measure, from 0.84 on training to 0.81 on the tested dataset. 'O' recognition seems to be the most difficult (test F1-measures: 0.90/'N', 0.81/'A' and 0.72/'O') due to high inter-patient variability and similarity with 'N'. These study results contribute to multidisciplinary areas, focusing on creation of robust and reliable cardiac monitoring systems in order to improve diagnosis, reduce unnecessary time-consuming expert ECG scoring and, consequently, ensure timely and effective treatment.",

Preclinical data suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway could be involved in its progression. This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial recruited chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced BTC displaying a wild-type (WT) KRAS status. Patients were randomized to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) ) with (arm A) or without (arm B) panitumumab (6 mg/kg) for up to 12 cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) analyzed in an intention-to-treat fashion. Eighty-nine patients (45 in arm A and 44 in arm B) were enrolled between June 2010 and September 2013. After a median follow-up of 10.1 months, the median PFS was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval, 3.3-7.2 months) in arm A and 4.4 months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.2 months) in arm B (P = .27). No survival differences were observed: the median overall survival was 9.9 months in arm A and 10.2 months in arm B (P = .42). In a subgroup analysis, no differences in PFS according to the site of the primary tumor were observed; patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with panitumumab may have had a survival benefit in comparison with the control group (15.1 vs 11.8 months, P = .13).

Recent studies identified miRNAs as important regulators of learning and memory in model organisms. So far, no mutations in specific miRNA genes have been associated with impaired cognitive functions. In three sibs and two unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID), overlapping 1p21.3 deletions were detected by genome-wide array analysis. The shortest region of overlap included dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and microRNA 137 (MIR137). DPYD is involved in autosomal recessive dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. Hemizygous DPYD deletions were previously suggested to contribute to a phenotype with autism spectrum disorder and speech delay. Interestingly, the mature microRNA transcript microRNA-137 (miR-137) was recently shown to be involved in modulating neurogenesis in adult murine neuronal stem cells. Therefore, this study investigated the possible involvement of MIR137 in the 1p21.3-deletion phenotype. The patients displayed a significantly decreased expression of both precursor and mature miR-137 levels, as well as significantly increased expression of the validated downstream targets microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila, Homologue 2 (EZH2), and the newly identified target Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). The study also demonstrated significant enrichment of miR-137 at the synapses of cortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role of miR-137 in regulating local synaptic protein synthesis machinery. This study showed that dosage effects of MIR137 are associated with 1p21.3 microdeletions and may therefore contribute to the ID phenotype in patients with deletions harbouring this miRNA. A local effect at the synapse might be responsible.",

The PAM50 method, based on the expression levels of 50 genes, uses a single sample predictor model to assign subtype labels to samples. Intrinsic errors reported within this assay demonstrate the challenge of identifying and understanding the breast cancer groups. In this study, we aim to: a) identify novel biomarkers for subtype individuation by exploring the competence of a newly proposed method named CM1 score, and b) apply an ensemble learning, as opposed to the use of a single classifier, for sample subtype assignment. The overarching objective is to improve class prediction. The microarray transcriptome data sets used in this study are: the METABRIC breast cancer data recorded for over 2000 patients, and the public integrated source from ROCK database with 1570 samples. We first computed the CM1 score to identify the probes with highly discriminative patterns of expression across samples of each intrinsic subtype. We further assessed the ability of 42 selected probes on assigning correct subtype labels using 24 different classifiers from the Weka software suite. For comparison, the same method was applied on the list of 50 genes from the PAM50 method. The CM1 score portrayed 30 novel biomarkers for predicting breast cancer subtypes, with the confirmation of the role of 12 well-established genes. Intrinsic subtypes assigned using the CM1 list and the ensemble of classifiers are more consistent and homogeneous than the original PAM50 labels. The new subtypes show accurate distributions of current clinical markers ER, PR and HER2, and survival curves in the METABRIC and ROCK data sets. Remarkably, the paradoxical attribution of the original labels reinforces the limitations of employing a single sample classifiers to predict breast cancer intrinsic subtypes.",

This machine learning method, which distinguishes sensitivity vs. resistance in breast cancer cell lines and validates predictions in patients; was also used to derive gene signatures of other HT (tamoxifen) and CT agents (methotrexate, epirubicin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil) used in METABRIC. Paclitaxel gene signatures exhibited the best performance, however the other agents also predicted survival with acceptable accuracies.

In this study, we employed the CM1 score to identify the most discriminative probes for each group, and an ensemble learning technique to assess the ability of these probes on assigning subtype labels using 24 different classifiers. Our analysis is comprised of an iterative computation of these methods and statistical measures performed on a set of over 2000 samples. The refined labels assigned using this iterative approach revealed to be more consistent and in better agreement with clinicopathological markers and patients' overall survival than those originally provided by the PAM50 method.

IntClust subtypes were significantly associated with histological type, tumour grade, receptor status, and lymphocytic infiltration (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Lymph node status and Nottingham Prognostic Index [NPI] categories were also significantly associated with IntClust subtype. IntClust 3 was enriched for tubular and lobular carcinomas, the latter largely accounting for the association with <i>CDH1</i> mutations in this cluster. Mucinous carcinomas were not present in IntClusts 5 or 10, but did not show an association with any of the remaining IntClusts. In contrast, medullary-like cancers were associated with IntClust 10 (15/26). Hormone receptor-positive tumours were scattered across all IntClusts. IntClust 5 was dominated by HER2 positivity (127/151), including both hormone receptor-positive (60/72) and hormone receptor-negative tumours (67/77). Triple-negative tumours comprised the majority of IntClust 10 (132/159) and around a quarter of IntClust 4 (52/217).

We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), Nottingham early stage oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT; n=697), the Nottingham anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-NeoACT; n=200), the MD Anderson taxane plus anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (MD Anderson-NeoACT; n=508), and the multicentre phase 2 neoadjuvant clinical trial cohort (phase 2 NeoACT; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00455533\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT00455533</a>; n=253). In the METABRIC cohort, we detected SPAG5 gene gain or amplification at the Ch17q11.2 locus in 206 (10%) of 1980 patients overall, 46 (19%) of 237 patients with a PAM50-HER2 phenotype, and 87 (18%) of 488 patients with PAM50-LumB phenotype. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b750, 95% CI 1\u00b718-1\u00b792, p=0\u00b700010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b740-2\u00b701, p&lt;0\u00b70001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b732-2\u00b712, p&lt;0\u00b70001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\u00b762, 95% CI 1\u00b703-2\u00b753, p=0\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b702-1\u00b758, p=0\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\u00b734, 1\u00b724-4\u00b742, p=0\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\u00b773, 1\u00b723-2\u00b746, p=0\u00b70020).

Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7031). In multivariable analysis, both high SPAG5 transcript and high SPAG5 protein concentrations were independent predictors for a higher proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response after combination cytotoxic chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: OR 1\u00b771, 95% CI, 1\u00b707-2\u00b774, p=0\u00b7024; Nottingham-ACT: 8\u00b775, 2\u00b742-31\u00b762, p=0\u00b70010). SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.

Affymetrix CEL files were downloaded and analyzed with Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis Console 3.0. Functional genomics was implemented with David Bioinformatics Resources 6.8. Data contained at Oncomine were used to identify genes upregulated in basal-like cancer compared to normal breast tissue. Data contained at cBioportal were used to assess for molecular alterations. The KMPlotter online tool, METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets were used to associate gene signatures with clinical outcome. 1564 upregulated genes were identified as differentially expressed between normal and basal-like tumors. Of these, 16 genes associated with immune function were linked with clinical outcome. HLA-C, HLA-F, HLA-G and TIGIT were associated with both improved relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The combination of HLA-F/TIGIT and HLA-C/HLA-F/TIGIT showed the most favorable outcome (HR for RFS 0.44, p&lt;0.001; HR for OS 0.22, p&lt;0.001; and HR for RFS 0.46, p&lt;0.001; HR for OS 0.15, p&lt;0.001; respectively). The association of HLA-C/HLA-F with outcome was confirmed using the METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets. No copy number alterations of these genes were identified.

Concordance index was used to measure the probability of prognostic score agreement with outcome. The EarlyR score and categorical risk strata (EarlyR-Low, EarlyR-Int, EarlyR-High) derived from expression of ESPL1, MKI67, SPAG5, PLK1 and PGR was prognostic of 8-year distant recurrence-free interval in Affymetrix (categorical P = 3.5 \u00d7 10<sup>-14</sup>; continuous P = 8.8 \u00d7 10<sup>-15</sup>) and METABRIC (categorical P &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>-16</sup>; continuous P &lt; 10<sup>-16</sup>) data sets of ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. Similar results were observed for the breast cancer-free interval end point. At most 13% of patients were intermediate risk and at least 66% patients were low risk in both ER<sup>+</sup> cohorts. The EarlyR score was significantly prognostic (distant recurrence-free interval; P &lt; .001) in both lymph node-negative and lymph node-positive patients and was independent from clinical factors. EarlyR and surrogates of current molecular signatures were comparable in prognostic significance by concordance index. The 5-gene EarlyR score is a robust prognostic assay that identified significantly fewer patients as intermediate risk and more as low risk than currently available assays.

To explore the contribution of cellular metabolism to cancer heterogeneity, we analyse the Metabric dataset, a landmark genomic and transcriptomic study of 2,000 individual breast tumours, in the context of the human genome-scale metabolic network. We create personalized metabolic landscapes for each tumour by exploring sets of active reactions that satisfy constraints derived from human biochemistry and maximize congruency with the Metabric transcriptome data. Classification of the personalized landscapes derived from 997 tumour samples within the Metabric discovery dataset reveals a novel poor prognosis cluster, reproducible in the 995-sample validation dataset. We experimentally follow mechanistic hypotheses resulting from the computational study and establish that active serotonin production is a major metabolic feature of the poor prognosis group.

To better personalize patients treatment it is critical to identify subgroups that would mostly benefit from it. We hypothesize that complex alterations of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway might be implicated in resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and aim to investigate whether signatures of Rb loss-of-function would identify breast cancer cell lines resistant to palbociclib. We established a gene expression signature of Rb loss-of-function (RBsig) by identifying genes correlated with E2F1 and E2F2 expression in breast cancers within The Cancer Genome Atlas. We assessed the RBsig prognostic role in the METABRIC and in a comprehensive breast cancer meta-dataset. Finally, we analyzed whether RBsig would discriminate palbociclib-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells in a large RNA sequencing-based dataset. The RBsig was associated with RB1 genetic status in all tumors (p &lt;7e-32) and in luminal or basal subtypes (p &lt; 7e-11 and p &lt; 0.002, respectively). The RBsig was prognostic in the METABRIC dataset (discovery: HR = 1.93 [1.5-2.4] p = 1.4e-08; validation: HR = 2.01 [1.6-2.5] p = 1.3e-09). Untreated and endocrine treated patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer expressing high RBsig had significantly worse recurrence free survival compared to those with low RBsig (HR = 2.37 [1.8 - 3.2] p = 1.87e-08 and HR = 2.62 [1.9- 3.5] p = 8.6e-11, respectively). The RBsig was able to identify palbociclib resistant and sensitive breast cancer cells (ROC AUC = 0,7778). Signatures of RB loss might be helpful in personalizing treatment of patients with HR+/HER2neg breast cancer. Further validation in patients receiving palbociclib is warranted.",

We evaluated whether incorporating TP53 mutation analysis can further enhance their prognostic accuracy. We examined TP53 mutation and the IHC4 score in tumors of 605 patients diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer at National Taiwan University Hospital (the NTUH cohort). We obtained information regarding TP53 mutation and PAM50 subtypes in 699 tumors from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort. We found that TP53 mutation was significantly associated with high-risk IHC4 group and with luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like subtypes. Despite the strong associations, TP53 mutation independently predicted shorter relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63, P = 0.007) in the NTUH cohort and shorter breast cancer-specific survival (HR = 2.35, P = &lt;0.001) in the METABRIC cohort. TP53 mutational analysis added significant prognostic information in addition to the IHC4 score (\u2206 LR-\u03c7(2) = 8.61, P = 0.002) in the NTUH cohort and the PAM50 subtypes (\u2206 LR-\u03c7(2) = 18.9, P = &lt;0.001) in the METABRIC cohort.

To determine how NF-\u03baB builds transcriptional control networks, we need to obtain a topographic map of the factor bound to the genome and correlate it with global gene expression. We used a ChIP cloning technique and identified novel NF-\u03baB target genes in response to virus infection. We discovered that most of the NF-\u03baB-bound genomic sites deviate from the consensus and are located away from conventional promoter regions. Remarkably, we identified a novel abundant NF-\u03baB-binding site residing in specialized Alu-repetitive elements having the potential for long range transcription regulation, thus suggesting that in addition to its known role, NF-\u03baB has a primate-specific function and a role in human evolution. By combining these data with global gene expression profiling of virus-infected cells, we found that most of the sites bound by NF-\u03baB in the human genome do not correlate with changes in gene expression of the nearby genes and they do not appear to function in the context of synthetic promoters. These results demonstrate that repetitive elements interspersed in the human genome function as common target sites for transcription factors and may play an important role in expanding the repertoire of binding sites to engage new genes into regulatory networks.",

Weighted TFBS contributions to putative gene regulation are integrated to derive an NF-\u03baB gene network. A de novo motif enrichment analysis uncovers secondary TFBSs (AP1, SP1) at characteristic distances from NF-\u03baB/RelA TFBSs. Comparison with experimental ENCODE ChIP-Seq data indicates that experimental TFBSs highly correlate with predicted sites. We observe that RelA-SP1-enriched promoters have distinct expression profiles from that of RelA-AP1 and are enriched in introns, CpG islands and DNase accessible sites. Sixteen novel NF-\u03baB/RelA-regulated genes and TFBSs were experimentally validated, including TANK, a negative feedback gene whose expression is NF-\u03baB/RelA dependent and requires a functional interaction with the AP1 TFBSs. Our probabilistic method yields more accurate NF-\u03baB/RelA-regulated networks than a traditional, distance-based approach, confirmed by both analysis of gene expression and increased informativity of Genome Ontology annotations. Our analysis provides new insights into how co-occurring TFBSs and local chromatin context orchestrate activation of NF-\u03baB/RelA sub-pathways differing in biological function and temporal expression patterns.",

Immortalized PTCs obtained from HO-1<sup>+/+</sup> and HO-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were treated with erastin or RSL3, ferroptosis inducers, in the presence or absence of antioxidants, an iron source, or an iron chelator.

Ferroptosis has recently been reported as a mechanism of iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death. However, ferroptosis in the heart is not well understood. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protects the heart against pathological stimuli such as ischemia. To define the role of cardiac mTOR on cell survival in iron-mediated cell death, we examined cardiomyocyte (CM) cell viability under excess iron and ferroptosis conditions. Adult mouse CMs were isolated from cardiac-specific mTOR transgenic mice, cardiac-specific mTOR knockout mice, or control mice. CMs were treated with ferric iron [Fe(III)]-citrate, erastin, a class 1 ferroptosis inducer, or Ras-selective lethal 3 (RSL3), a class 2 ferroptosis inducer. Live/dead cell viability assays revealed that Fe(III)-citrate, erastin, and RSL3 induced cell death. Cotreatment with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, inhibited cell death in all conditions. mTOR overexpression suppressed Fe(III)-citrate, erastin, and RSL3-induced cell death, whereas mTOR deletion exaggerated cell death in these conditions. 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production showed that erastin-induced ROS production was significantly lower in mTOR transgenic versus control CMs. These findings suggest that ferroptosis is a significant type of cell death in CMs and that mTOR plays an important role in protecting CMs against excess iron and ferroptosis, at least in part, by regulating ROS production. Understanding the effects of mTOR in preventing iron-mediated cell death will provide a new therapy for patients with myocardial infarction.

Over the last 2 decades, LHM has become the primary form of treatment in many centers. However, since the first description of POEM in 2010, this technique has widely disseminated, despite the absence of long-term results and randomized trials. A systematic Medline literature search of articles on LHM and POEM for the treatment of achalasia was performed. The main outcomes measured were improvement of dysphagia and posttreatment gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Linear regression was used to model the effect of each procedure on the different outcomes. Fifty-three studies reported data on LHM (5834 patients), and 21 articles examined POEM (1958 patients). Mean follow-up was significantly longer for studies of LHM (41.5 vs. 16.2 mo, P &lt; 0.0001). Predicted probabilities for improvement in dysphagia at 12 months were 93.5% for POEM and 91.0% for LHM (P = 0.01), and at 24 months were 92.7% for POEM and 90.0% for LHM (P = 0.01). Patients undergoing POEM were more likely to develop GERD symptoms (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.33-2.14, P &lt; 0.0001), GERD evidenced by erosive esophagitis (OR 9.31, 95% CI 4.71-18.85, P &lt; 0.0001), and GERD evidenced by pH monitoring (OR 4.30, 95% CI 2.96-6.27, P &lt; 0.0001).

However, peri-esophageal anti-reflux barriers are preserved in POEM, which might prevent GERD. Hence, we sought to compare the objective esophageal pH study findings in achalasia patients after POEM and LHM. Achalasia patients undergoing POEM from 2014 to 2015 at our institution were matched 1:3 with LHM patients using propensity score matching. Demographics, prior interventions, pre-treatment and 2-month post-treatment timed barium esophagram (TBE), high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) and 24-h esophageal pH study findings were compared between the two groups. Thirty-one patients in the POEM group and 88 patients in the LHM group were included. Larger proportion of POEM patients had prior interventions for achalasia as compared to LHM patients (overall: 71% vs. 44.3%; p = 0.012). Esophageal acid exposure was significantly higher in POEM as compared to LHM patients (abnormal total acid exposure: 48.4% vs. 13.6%; p &lt; 0.001, abnormal DeMeester score 54.8% vs. 17.4%; p = 0.005 respectively). In sub-group analysis, similar results were noted on 24-h pH study after exclusion of the POEM patients with prior LHM and corresponding matches. There was no significant difference in the rate of GERD symptoms between POEM and LHM. There was no significant correlation between the post-treatment basal lower esophageal sphincter pressure and integrated relaxation pressure with abnormal acid exposure in either POEM or LHM. In patients with achalasia, POEM leads to significantly higher rates of abnormal esophageal acid exposure, without an increase in the rate of GERD symptoms, when compared to LHM with fundoplication. Interestingly, prior LHM has no impact on post-POEM pH study findings. Potential of increased esophageal acid exposure and possible consequences should be discussed with all patients prior to POEM.

Thirteen patients who underwent POEM were compared with 18 patients who received LHM. These patients were similar in age, sex, symptoms duration, Eckardt score, and previous therapy (all P&gt;0.05). Mean myotomy lengths were similar (P=0.73). Operation time was shorter in the POEM group (P=0.001). One patient (7.7%) developed pneumothorax after POEM and 1 patient (5.6%) experienced postoperative infection after LHM (P=1.00). Treatment success was achieved in 83.3% (9/12) of POEM patients and 80.0% (12/15) of LHM patients (P=1.00). Both POEM and LHM significantly reduced Eckardt score (both P=0.00). GERD rate was similar (8.3% vs. 6.7%, P=1.00). There was no difference in all aspects of quality of life between the 2 groups. Long-term outcomes indicate that POEM is an effective treatment that is comparable with LHM. More data of randomized trials comparing POEM with LHM will enrich the existing evidence.",

The incorporation of robotic technology can improve many limitations of laparoscopic surgery, through, for example, the availability of three-dimensional vision, increasing the degrees of movement, avoiding the fulcrum effect and optimizing ergonomics. The aim of this study was to compare robotic-assisted laparoscopic Heller myotomy (RAHM) with laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) in terms of efficacy and safety. Thirty-one patients with diagnosis of achalasia confirmed by esophagogram and manometry were included. Dysphagia and weight loss were the main complaints in both groups. 18 patients were treated with LHM and 13 patients with RAHM. There was no difference in mean operative time (76 \u00b1 13 vs. 79 \u00b1 20 min; P = 0.73). Intraoperative complications were less frequent in the robotic-assisted procedures (5.5% vs. 0%); however, this was a non-significant difference. 94.5-100% of patients had relief of their symptoms. We conclude that RAHM is a safe and effective procedure. The operative time is no longer than in LHM, but it is necessary to evaluate the technique in randomized clinical trials to determine its advantages in terms of intraoperative complications.",

However, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is providing good short-term results. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the safety and efficacy of LHM and POEM. A search of PubMed, Cochrane database, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, and current contents for English-language articles comparing LHM and POEM between 2007 and 2016 was performed. Variables analyzed included prior endoscopic treatment, prior medical treatment, prior Heller myotomy, operative time, overall complications rate, postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), length of hospital stay, postoperative pain score, and long-term GERD. Seven trials consisting of 483 (LHM=250, POEM=233) patients were analyzed. Preoperative variables, for example, prior endoscopic treatment [odds ratio (OR), 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-4.61; P=0.96], prior medical treatment [weighted mean difference (WMD), 1.22; 95% CI, 0.52-2.88; P=0.65], and prior Heller myotomy (WMD, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.13-1.67; P=0.25) were comparable. Operative time was 26.28 minutes, nonsignificantly longer for LHM (WMD, 26.28; 95% CI, -11.20 to 63.70; P=0.17). There was a comparable overall complication rate (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.56-2.77; P=0.59), postoperative GERD rate (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.70-2.30; P=0.44), length of hospital stay (WMD, 0.30; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.85; P=0.28), postoperative pain score (WMD, -0.26; 95% CI, -1.58 to 1.06; P=0.70), and long-term GERD (WMD, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.27-4.1; P=0.08) for both procedures. There was a significantly higher short-term clinical treatment failure rate for LHM (OR, 9.82; 95% CI, 2.06-46.80; P&lt;0.01). POEM compares favorably to LHM for achalasia treatment in short-term perioperative outcomes. However, there was a significantly higher clinical treatment failure rate for LHM on short-term postoperative follow-up. Presently long-term postoperative follow-up data for POEM beyond 1 year are unavailable and eagerly awaited.",

Patient demographics, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, time to resume diet and analgesic requirement were recorded. Clinical outcomes including recurrence of dysphagia, need for reintervention, and occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were recorded. From 2001 to 2014, 33 patients underwent POEM whereas 23 patients received LHM. Patients LHM had with longer mean operative time (P = 0.02), more blood loss (P = 0.001) and higher requirement for analgesics (P = 0.009) than those treated by POEM. Hospital stay and time to resume diet were similar. Both POEM and LHM achieved similar dysphagia scores at postoperative 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. Twenty-six percent of LHM patients and 15.2% of POEM patients sustained gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after treatment (P = 0.311). Six patients required regular proton pump inhibitor three after POEM and three after LHM (P = 0.639). Thirteen percent of LHM patients sustained recurrent dysphagia and one required reintervention. There was no recurrence in the POEM group. Follow-up duration (mean [SD]) for the LHM group was significantly longer (60 [42] months vs 6 [4] months; P = 0.001). There was also no difference in all four aspects of GERD-related quality of life outcomes. Compared to LHM, POEM achieved shorter operative time, less blood loss and pain. POEM is comparable to LHM for treatment of achalasia with similar incidence of GERD after the procedure.",

However, there are no large studies evaluating the results of LHM in the pediatric population, and the need of a concomitant fundoplication remains unclear. The aim of the study is to appraise the results of LHM based on a systematic literature review. MEDLINE search of the English literature was performed for \"achalasia,\" \"children,\" \"laparoscopy,\" \"Heller,\" \"myotomy,\" and \"cardiomyotomy.\" Frequency of postoperative symptoms was grouped to calculate the percentage of patients with symptoms improvement. Incidence of postoperative gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and dysphagia between patients with and without fundoplication at the time of LHM was compared by Fisher's Exact Test. P &lt; .05 was regarded as significant. Twenty-one studies were analyzed (331 children, 1-19 years). All studies were retrospective case-series reviews. Intraoperative complications occurred in 33 patients (10%), with esophageal perforations in 31 (9%), and conversion to open procedure in 9 (2.7%). Fundoplication was performed in 271 (82%): Dor (n = 205, 76%), Toupet (n = 49, 18%), Thal (n = 13, 4.5%), and Nissen (n = 4, 1.5%). Incidence of postoperative GER and dysphagia was similar between children with and without fundoplication (P = 1). Forty-nine (15%) required re-intervention: pneumatic dilatations (n = 30, 9%), redo-surgery (n = 23, 7%), botox injection (n = 1, 0.3%), and medical therapy (n = 5, 1.5%). LHM for achalasia is effective in 85% of children. Revision surgery is required in 7%. There is no difference in incidence of GER and dysphagia between patients with and without fundoplication. Routine use of an additional fundoplication might not be justified.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29218664": " Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has recently emerged as a viable option relative to the classic approach of laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for the treatment of esophageal achalasia. In this cost-utility analysis of POEM and LHM, we hypothesized that POEM would be cost-effective relative to LHM. A stochastic cost-utility analysis of treatment for achalasia was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of POEM relative to LHM. Costs were estimated from the provider perspective and obtained from our institution's cost-accounting database. The measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) which were estimated from direct elicitation of utility using a visual analog scale. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was assessed by bootstrapping the sample and computing the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). Patients treated within an 11-year period (2004-2016) were recruited for participation (20 POEM, 21 LHM). During the index admission, the mean costs for POEM ($8630 \u00b1 $2653) and the mean costs for LHM ($7604 \u00b1 $2091) were not significantly different (P = 0.179). Additionally, mean QALYs for POEM (0.413 \u00b1 0.248) were higher than that associated with LHM (0.357 \u00b1 0.338), but this difference was also not statistically significant (P = 0.55). The ICER suggested that it would cost an additional $18,536 for each QALY gained using POEM. There was substantial uncertainty in the ICER; there was a 48.25% probability that POEM was cost-effective at the mean ICER. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, there was a 68.31% probability that POEM was cost-effective relative to LHM. In the treatment of achalasia, POEM appears to be cost-effective relative to LHM depending on one's willingness-to-pay for an additional QALY.",

Although laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) is the current gold standard management for type III achalasia, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is conceivably superior because it allows for a longer myotomy. Our aims were to compare the efficacy and safety of POEM with LHM for type III achalasia patients. A retrospective study of 49 patients who underwent POEM for type III achalasia across eight centers were compared to 26 patients who underwent LHM at a single institution. Procedural data were abstracted and pre- and post-procedural symptoms were recorded. Clinical response was defined by improvement of symptoms and decrease in Eckardt stage to \u2264 1. Secondary outcomes included length of myotomy, procedure duration, length of hospital stay, and rate of adverse events. Clinical response was significantly more frequent in the POEM cohort (98.0 % vs 80.8 %; P = 0.01). POEM patients had significantly shorter mean procedure time than LHM patients (102 min vs 264 min; P &lt; 0.01) despite longer length of myotomy (16 cm vs 8 cm; P &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference between POEM and LHM in the length of hospital stay (3.3 days vs 3.2 days; P = 0.68), respectively. Rate of adverse events was significantly less in the POEM group (6 % vs 27 %; P &lt; 0.01). POEM allows for a longer myotomy than LHM, which may result in improved clinical outcomes.

Previous literature comparing POEM to LHM has focused primarily on postoperative outcome parameters such as complications, dysphagia scores and gastro-esophageal reflux severity. This study specifically compares postoperative pain following POEM to pain following LHM, the current gold-standard operation. A retrospective review of all patients undergoing POEM or LHM for achalasia was performed from 2006 to 2015. Data collection included demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS) and pain scores (arrival to the recovery room, 1 h postoperative, average first 24 h and upon discharge). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and Chi-square test. Forty-four POEM patients and 122 LHM patients were identified. The average age (52.2 \u00b1 20.75 vs 50.9 \u00b1 17.89 years, p = 0.306) and BMI (28.1 \u00b1 7.62 vs 27.6 \u00b1 7.07 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.824) did not differ between the POEM and LHM groups, respectively; however, the American Society of Anesthesiology scores were higher in the POEM patients (2.43 \u00b1 0.62 vs 2.11 \u00b1 0.71, p = 0.011). There were no differences in rates of smoking, diabetes, cardiac disease or pulmonary disease. The average pain scores upon arrival to the recovery room and 1 h postoperatively were lower in the POEM group (2.3 \u00b1 3.014 vs 3.61 \u00b1 3 0.418, p = 0.025 and 2.2 \u00b1 2.579 vs 3.46 \u00b1 3.063, p = 0.034, respectively).

After standardizing opioid administration against 10 mg of oral morphine, the POEM group used significantly less narcotics that the LHM group (35.8 vs 101.8 mg, p &lt; 0.001) while hospitalized. The average LOS for the POEM group was 31.2 h and 55.79 for the LHM group (p &lt; 0.0001). At discharge, fewer POEM patients required a prescription for a narcotic analgesic (6.81 vs 92.4 %, p &lt; 0.0001). POEM demonstrated significantly less postoperative pain upon arrival to the recovery room and 1 h postoperatively. To achieve similar pain scores during the first 24 h and at discharge, LHM patients required more narcotic analgesic administration. Despite a significantly shorter LOS, fewer POEM patients require a prescription for narcotic analgesics compared to LHM. POEM is a less painful procedure for achalasia than LHM, permitting earlier hospital discharge with little need for home narcotic use.",

Data of pediatric patients with EA, who underwent LHM and POEM from February 2009 to December 2013 in two centers, were collected. Eighteen patients (9 male, mean age: 11.6 years; range: 2-17 years) were included. Nine patients (6 male, mean age: 10.7 years; range: 2-16 years) underwent LHM, and the other 9 (3 males, mean age: 12.2 years; range: 6-17 years) underwent POEM procedure. Mean operation time was shorter in POEM group compared with LHM group (62/149 minutes). Myotomy was longer in POEM group than in LHM group (11/7 cm). One major complication occurred after LHM (esophageal perforation). No clinical and manometric differences were observed between LHM and POEM in follow-up. The incidence of iatrogenic gastroesophageal reflux disease was low (1 patient in both groups). Results of a midterm follow-up show that LHM and POEM are safe and effective treatments also in children. Besides, POEM is a mini-invasive technique with an inferior execution timing compared to LHM.

We reviewed demographic and procedure-related data for patients who underwent either LHM or POEM for achalasia between January 2011 and May 2016. Phone interviews were conducted assessing post-procedure achalasia symptoms via the Eckardt score and achalasia severity questionnaire (ASQ). Demographics, disease factors, and survey results were compared between LHM and POEM patients using univariate analysis. Significant predictors of procedure failure were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. There were no serious complications in 110 consecutive patients who underwent LHM or POEM during the study period, and 96 (87%) patients completed phone surveys. There was a nonsignificant trend toward better patient-reported outcomes with POEM. There were significant differences in patient characteristics including sex, achalasia type, mean residual lower esophageal pressure (rLESP), and follow-up time. The only univariate predictors of an unsatisfactory Eckardt score or ASQ were longer follow-up and lower rLESP, with follow-up length being the only predictor on multivariate analysis. There were significant demographic and clinical differences in patient selection for POEM vs LHM in our group. Although the 2 procedures have similar patient-reported effectiveness, subjective outcomes seem to decline as a result of time rather than procedure type.",

The overproduction of immature myeloblasts (white blood cells) is the characteristic feature of AML, thus flooding the bone marrow and reducing its capacity to produce normal blood cells. USFDA on August 1, 2017, approved a drug named Enasidenib formerly known as AG-221 which is being marketed under the name Idhifa to treat R/R AML with IDH2 mutation. The present review depicts the broad profile of enasidenib including various aspects of chemistry, preclinical, clinical studies, pharmacokinetics, mode of action and toxicity studies. Various reports and research articles have been referred to summarize different aspects related to chemistry and pharmacokinetics of enasidenib. Clinical data was collected from various recently published clinical reports including clinical trial outcomes. The various findings of enasidenib revealed that it has been designed to allosterically inhibit mutated IDH2 to treat R/R AML patients. It has also presented good safety and efficacy profile along with 9.3 months overall survival rates of patients in which disease has relapsed. The drug is still under study either in combination or solely to treat hematological malignancies. Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket. Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and calcium levels, etc. Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.",

The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antimyeloma activity. Twenty-eight patients, enrolled using a standard '3 + 3' dose escalation, received one or two (n = 3) cycles of lucatumumab 1\u00b70, 3\u00b70, 4\u00b75 or 6\u00b70 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. Common lucatumumab-related adverse events were reversible, mild-to-moderate infusion reactions. Severe adverse events were anaemia, chills, hypercalcaemia and pyrexia (7% each). DLTs included grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase and grade 4 increased lipase (n = 1 each). The MTD was 4\u00b75 mg/kg. At doses \u22653\u00b70 mg/kg, sustained receptor occupancy (\u226587%), observed throughout weekly infusions up to 5 weeks after the last infusion, correlated with an estimated half-life of 4-19 d.

Data on 4000 episodes of self-harm presenting to Emergency Departments (ED) between 2010 and 2012 were obtained from four established monitoring systems in England. Episodes were assigned a risk category for each scale and followed up for 6 months. The episode-based repeat rate was 28% (1133/4000) and the incidence of suicide was 0.5% (18/3962). The MSHR and ReACT performed with high sensitivity (98% and 94% respectively) and low specificity (15% and 23%). The SPS and the MSPS performed with relatively low sensitivity (24-29% and 9-12% respectively) and high specificity (76-77% and 90%). The area under the curve was 71% for both MSHR and ReACT, 51% for SPS and 49% for MSPS. Differences in predictive accuracy by subgroup were small.

Psychiatric outpatients (n = 153) with a lifetime history of suicide ideation/attempt and their treating clinicians (n = 67) were evaluated at intake. Clinicians completed a standard suicide risk instrument (modified SAD PERSONS scale), a 10-point Likert scale assessment of judgment of patient suicide risk (Clinician Prediction Scale), and a measure of their emotional responses to the patient (Therapist Response Questionnaire-Suicide Form). The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were administered at a one-month follow-up assessment (n = 114, 74.5%). Clinician judgment of risk significantly predicted suicidal thoughts and behaviors at follow-up. Both the standard suicide risk instrument and clinician emotional responses contributed independently to the clinician assessment of risk, which, in turn, mediated their relationships with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Our findings validate the importance of clinical judgment in assessing suicide risk. Clinical judgment appears to be informed both by concrete risk factors and clinicians' emotional responses to suicidal patients, highlighting emotional awareness as a promising area for research and training.",

Scale <i>a priori</i> cut-offs were evaluated using diagnostic accuracy statistics. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine optimal cut-offs and compare global accuracy.<b>Results</b>In total, 483 episodes of self-harm were included in the study. The episode-based 6-month repetition rate was 30% (<i>n</i> = 145). Sensitivity ranged from 1% (95% CI 0-5) for the SAD PERSONS scale, to 97% (95% CI 93-99) for the Manchester Self-Harm Rule.

The SAD PERSONS suicide risk assessment scale is widely implemented in clinical settings despite limited supporting evidence. This article aims to determine the ability of the SAD PERSONS scale (SPS) to predict future suicide in the emergency department. Five thousand four hundred sixty-two consecutive adults were seen by psychiatry consultation teams in two tertiary emergency departments with linkage to population-based administrative data to determine suicide deaths within 6 months, 1, and 5 years. Seventy-seven (1.4%) individuals died by suicide during the study period. When predicting suicide at 12 months, medium- and high-risk scores on SPS had a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 60%; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.9 and 99%, respectively. Half of the suicides at both 6- and 12-month intervals were classified as low risk by SPS at index visit. The area under the curve at 12 months for the Modified SPS was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] range 0.51-0.67). High-risk scores (compared to low risk) were significantly associated with death by suicide over the 5-year study period using the SPS (hazard ratio 2.49; 95% CI 1.34-4.61) and modified version (hazard ratio 2.29; 95% CI 1.24-2.29).

The objective of this study was to examine the ability of the scale in predicting suicide attempts. Participants consisted of consecutive referrals (N=4,019) over 2 years (January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010) to psychiatric services in the emergency departments of the 2 largest tertiary care hospitals in the province of Manitoba, Canada. SAD PERSONS and Modified SAD PERSONS (MSPS) scale scores were recorded for individuals at their index and all subsequent presentations. The 2 main outcome measures in the study included current suicide attempts (at index presentation) and future suicide attempts (within the next 6 months). The ability of the scales to predict suicide attempts was evaluated with logistic regression, sensitivity and specificity analyses, and receiver operating characteristic curves. 566 people presented with suicide attempts (14.1% of the sample). Both SAD PERSONS and MSPS showed poor predictive ability for future suicide attempts. Compared to low risk scores, high risk baseline scores had low sensitivity (19.6% and 40.0%, respectively) and low positive predictive value (5.3% and 7.4%, respectively). SAD PERSONS did not predict suicide attempts better than chance (area under the curve =0.572; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.64; P value nonsignificant). Stepwise regression identified 5 original scale items that accounted for the greatest proportion of future suicide attempt variance. High risk scores using this model had high sensitivity (93.5%) and were associated with a 5-fold higher likelihood of future suicide attempt presentation (odds ratio =5.58; 95% CI, 2.24-13.86; P&lt;.001).

A brief rating scale to assess repetition risk of self-harm is important for high-risk identification and early interventions in suicide prevention. The study aimed to examine the validity of the Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale (CSPS) and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical settings. One hundred and forty-seven patients with self-harm were recruited from the Emergency Department and assessed at baseline and the sixth month. The controls, 284 people without self-harm from the Family Medicine Department in the same hospital were recruited and assessed concurrently. The psychometric properties of the CSPS were examined using baseline and follow-up measurements that assessed a variety of suicide risk factors. Clinical feasibility and applicability of the CSPS were further evaluated by a group of general nurses who used case vignette approach in CSPS risk assessment in clinical settings. An open-ended question inquiring their opinions of scale adaptation to hospital inpatient assessment for suicide risks were also analyzed using content analysis. The CSPS was significantly correlated with other scales measuring depression, hopelessness and suicide ideation. A cut-off point of the scale was at 4/5 in predicting 6-month self-harm repetition with the sensitivity and specificity being 65.4% and 58.1%, respectively. Based on the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, the predictive validity of the scale showed a better performance than the other scales. Fifty-four nurses, evaluating the scale using case vignette found it a useful tool to raise the awareness of suicide risk and a considerable tool to be adopted into nursing care. The Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale is a brief instrument with acceptable psychometric properties for self-harm prediction. However, cautions should be paid to level of therapeutic relationships during assessment, staff workload and adequate training for wider clinical applications.",

Short sleep was defined by self-assessment as \u2264 5 h per day. The MINI and the DSM-IV version of the International Personality Disorder Examination Screening Questionnaire were used to diagnose Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, respectively. Suicide intent and lethality were evaluated through the Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS) and the Risk-Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS), respectively.

Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses explored frequencies of short sleep in 3 samples. Chi-square tests explored whether or not suicide intent, lethality and risk were greater in SAs with short-sleep versus those without short-sleep. Short sleep was more prevalent in SAs than in psychiatric controls only in males. In female SAs, short sleep was significantly associated with several SIS items and high scores in the SAD PERSONS.

Subjects completed a series of depression/suicide screening tools: the Columbia Suicide Severity Scale, SAD PERSONS scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Clinicians were also asked about their impression on likelihood of patient admission. Outcome measures were as follows: need for psychiatric hospital admission, prolonged stay at psychiatric facility, and any adverse events during ED stay including need for unscheduled psychiatric or sedating medications, need for physical restraints, and need for intervention by security staff. The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and Columbia Suicide Severity Scale did not significantly predict within-ED adverse events or admissions to psychiatric facilities. Wald test for individual parameters at an \u03b1 of .10 level found that patients who were screened positive by their nurse had 3.37 times the odds of adverse within-ED events; patients with a positive SAD PERSONS score had 8.18 times the odds of psychiatric admission greater than 5 days. However, at the \u03b1 of .05 level, no screening tools correlated with patient ED course or likelihood of psychiatric admission.

Computer-aided diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear, previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in classification. Our results indicate that segmentation border enlargement produces, to a certain degree, better results across all metrics of interest when using a convolutional based classifier built using the transfer learning paradigm. Consequently, preprocessing methods which produce borders larger than the actual lesion can potentially improve classifier performance, more than both perfect segmentation, using dermatologist created ground truth masks, and no segmentation altogether.",

While designing a diagnostic model for general handheld imaging systems is an emerging trend, this article proposes a computer-aided decision support system for macro images captured by a general-purpose camera. General imaging conditions are adversely affected by nonuniform illumination, which further affects the extraction of relevant information. To mitigate it, we process an image to define a smooth illumination surface using the multistage illumination compensation approach, and the infected region is extracted using the proposed multimode segmentation method. The lesion information is numerated as a feature set comprising geometry, photometry, border series, and texture measures. The redundancy in feature set is reduced using information theory methods, and a classification boundary is modeled to distinguish benign and malignant samples using support vector machine, random forest, neural network, and fast discriminative mixed-membership-based naive Bayesian classifiers. Moreover, the experimental outcome is supported by hypothesis testing and boxplot representation for classification losses. The simulation results prove the significance of the proposed model that shows an improved performance as compared with competing arts.",

However, the accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e., lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to refine the coarse classification results by calculating the distance heat-map. A straight-forward CNN is proposed for the dermoscopic feature extraction task. The proposed deep learning frameworks were evaluated on the ISIC 2017 dataset.

In order to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers) can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data. First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for accurate skin lesion segmentation, and further enhance its capability by incorporating a multi-scale contextual information integration scheme. Finally, we seamlessly integrate the proposed FCRN (for segmentation) and other very deep residual networks (for classification) to form a two-stage framework. This framework enables the classification network to extract more representative and specific features based on segmented results instead of the whole dermoscopy images, further alleviating the insufficiency of training data. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on ISBI 2016 Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance gains of the proposed framework, ranking the first in classification and the second in segmentation among 25 teams and 28 teams, respectively.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either lithium or matched placebo tablets. Randomisation was via an online system done at the level of the individual by block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes, stratified by study centre and site of disease onset (limb or bulbar). All patients and assessing study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the rate of survival at 18 months and was analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with Eudract, number 2008-006891-31. Between May 26, 2009, and Nov 10, 2011, 243 patients were screened, 214 of whom were randomly assigned to receive lithium (107 patients) or placebo (107 patients). Two patients discontinued treatment and one died before the target therapeutic lithium concentration could be achieved. 63 (59%) of 107 patients in the placebo group and 54 (50%) of 107 patients in the lithium group were alive at 18 months. The survival functions did not differ significantly between groups (Mantel-Cox log-rank \u03c7(2) on 1 df=1\u00b764; p=0\u00b720). After adjusting for study centre and site of onset using logistic regression, the relative odds of survival at 18 months (lithium vs placebo) was 0\u00b771 (95% CI 0\u00b740-1\u00b724). 56 patients in the placebo group and 61 in the lithium group had at least one serious adverse event. We found no evidence of benefit of lithium on survival in patients with ALS, but nor were there safety concerns, which had been identified in previous studies with less conventional designs. This finding emphasises the importance of pursuing adequately powered trials with clear endpoints when testing new treatments.

This clinical study was published in addition with basic (in vitro) and pre-clinical (in vivo) data demonstrating a defect of autophagy as a final common pathway in the genesis of ALS. In fact, lithium was used as an autophagy inducer. In detailing the protective effects of lithium we found for the first time that this drug stimulates the biogenesis of mitochondria in the central nervous system and, uniquely in the spinal cord, it induces neuronogenesis and neuronal differentiation. In particular, the effects induced by lithium can be summarized as follows: (i) the removal of altered mitochondria and protein aggregates; (ii) the biogenesis of well-structured mitochondria; (iii) the suppression of glial proliferation; (iv) the differentiation of newly formed neurons in the spinal cord towards a specific phenotype. In this addendum we focus on defective autophagy as a \"leit motif\" in ALS and the old and novel features of lithium which bridge autophagy activation to concomitant effects that may be useful for the treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the biogenesis of mitochondria and the increase of calbindin D 28K-positive neurons, which are likely to support powerful neuroprotection towards autophagy failure, mitochondriopathy and neuronal loss in the spinal cord.",

We performed a multicenter trial with lithium carbonate to assess its tolerability, safety, and efficacy in patients with ALS, comparing 2 different target blood levels (0.4-0.8 mEq/L, therapeutic group [TG], vs 0.2-0.4 mEq/L, subtherapeutic group [STG]). The study was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized, dose-finding trial, conducted from May 2008 to November 2009 in 21 Italian ALS centers. The trial was registered with the public database of the Italian Agency for Drugs (http://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it/) (EudraCT number 2008-001094-15). As of October 2009, a total of 171 patients had been enrolled, 87 randomized to the TG and 84 to the STG. The interim data analysis, performed per protocol, showed that 117 patients (68.4%) discontinued the study because of death/tracheotomy/severe disability, adverse events (AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs), or lack of efficacy. The Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial on November 2, 2009. Lithium was not well-tolerated in this cohort of patients with ALS, even at subtherapeutic doses. The 2 doses were equivalent in terms of survival/severe disability and functional data. The relatively high frequency of AEs/SAEs and the reduced tolerability of lithium raised serious doubts about its safety in ALS. The study provides Class II evidence that therapeutic (0.4-0.8 mEq/L) vs subtherapeutic (0.2-0.4 mEq/L) lithium carbonate did not differ in the primary outcome of efficacy (survival/loss of autonomy) in ALS. Both target levels led to dropouts in more than 30% of participants due to patient-perceived lack of efficacy and AEs.",

In the present study, we found that daily doses of lithium, leading to plasma levels ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mEq/liter, delay disease progression in human patients affected by ALS. None of the patients treated with lithium died during the 15 months of the follow-up, and disease progression was markedly attenuated when compared with age-, disease duration-, and sex-matched control patients treated with riluzole for the same amount of time. In a parallel study on a genetic ALS animal model, the G93A mouse, we found a marked neuroprotection by lithium, which delayed disease onset and duration and augmented the life span. These effects were concomitant with activation of autophagy and an increase in the number of the mitochondria in motor neurons and suppressed reactive astrogliosis. Again, lithium reduced the slow necrosis characterized by mitochondrial vacuolization and increased the number of neurons counted in lamina VII that were severely affected in saline-treated G93A mice. After lithium administration in G93A mice, the number of these neurons was higher even when compared with saline-treated WT. All these mechanisms may contribute to the effects of lithium, and these results offer a promising perspective for the treatment of human patients affected by ALS.",

The excellent results of this pilot study engendered considerable optimism among patients, their families, patients' associations, and the scientific community. This report sparked numerous phase ii clinical trials. Many patients who were not included in these studies used all resources at their disposal to access the drug as treatment under a compassionate use programme.

Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EudraCT (January 1996-August 2012). To date, we have information on more 1100 patients treated with lithium. Unfortunately, the results do not confirm the positive effect described in the pilot study, which suggests that this drug is not effective at slowing disease progression. Two trials had to be suspended before the scheduled completion date due to the ineffectiveness of the drug as well as numerous adverse effects. A recently published study also ruled out any possible modest effect. There is evidence to suggest that lithium has no short-term benefits in ALS. A comparison of the group of patients treated with lithium+riluzole and the control group treated with riluzole alone showed no statistically significant differences in rates of functional decline, deterioration of respiratory function, or survival time. Furthermore, there was no evidence that it was more effective than the placebo.",

It seems imperative to explore new possibilities of treatment based on targetable alterations known to be present in GB. Among others, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor or EGFR (HER1) mutations or amplifications are the most prevalent alterations in GB. In fact, around 40% of GB cases show amplification of EGFR gene, and half of these patients carry the EGFRvIII mutation, a deletion that generates a continuous activation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor. Areas covered: We review the current knowledge about Dacomitinib, an oral, irreversible, second-generation, pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in the treatment of glioblastoma. Dacomitinib has noteworthy antiglioma activity in preclinical models and has been tested in one phase II trial in patients with recurrent GB with EGFR amplification. Expert opinion: Despite the poor global results of Dacomitinib in recurrent GB shown in a phase II trial, some patients had a significant benefit. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the knowledge about the mechanisms of failure or resistance to EGFR inhibitors in GB.",

Patients with first recurrence were enrolled in 2 cohorts. Cohort A included patients with EGFR gene amplification without EGFRvIII mutation. Cohort B included patients with EGFR gene amplification and EGFRvIII mutation. Dacomitinib was administered (45 mg/day) until disease progression/unacceptable adverse events (AEs). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS; RANO criteria) at 6 months (PFS6). Thirty patients in Cohort A and 19 in Cohort B were enrolled. Median age was 59 years (range 39-81), 65.3% were male, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0/1/2 were 10.2%/65.3%/24.5%, respectively. PFS6 was 10.6% (Cohort A: 13.3%; Cohort B: 5.9%) with a median PFS of 2.7 months (Cohort A: 2.7 mo; Cohort B: 2.6 mo). Four patients were progression free at 6 months and 3 patients were so at 12 months. Median overall survival was 7.4 months (Cohort A: 7.8 mo; Cohort B: 6.7 mo). The best overall response included 1 complete response and 2 partial responses (4.1%). Stable disease was observed in 12 patients (24.5%: eight in Cohort A and four in Cohort B). Diarrhea and rash were the most common AEs; 20 (40.8%) patients experienced grade 3-4 drug-related AEs. Dacomitinib has a limited single-agent activity in recurrent GB with EGFR amplification.

However, NK cell function has been shown to be potentially diminished by factors common in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we assessed the synergistic potential of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and killer immunoglobin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand mismatched NK cells to potentiate NK cell antitumor reactivity in multiple myeloma (MM). Hypoxia, lactate, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or combinations were selected to mimic the TME. To investigate this, NK cells from healthy donors were isolated and NK cell ADCC capacity in response to MM cells was assessed in flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity and degranulation (CD107a) assays in the presence of TME factors. Hypoxia, lactate and PGE2 reduced cytotoxicity of NK cells against myeloma target cells. The addition of daratumumab (anti-CD38 antibody) augmented NK-cell cytotoxicity against target cells expressing high CD38, but not against CD38 low or negative target cells also in the presence of TME. Co-staining for inhibitory KIRs and NKG2A demonstrated that daratumumab enhanced degranulation of all NK cell subsets. Nevertheless, KIR-ligand mismatched NK cells were slightly better effector cells than KIR-ligand matched NK cells. In summary, our study shows that combination therapy using strategies to maximize activating NK cell signaling by triggering ADCC in combination with an approach to minimize inhibitory signaling through a selection of KIR-ligand mismatched donors, can help to overcome the NK-suppressive TME. This can serve as a platform to improve the clinical efficacy of NK cells.",

Administering folic acid prior to the administration of (99m)Tc-EF has been shown to improve SPECT images. Here, we conducted a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and radiation dosimetry of (99m)Tc-EF injection following pre-administration of folic acid in healthy Japanese male adults. Six healthy Japanese male adults were enrolled in the study. Folic acid was intravenously administered, followed 1-3 min later by an intravenous injection of (99m)Tc-EF (740 MBq \u00b1 20 %). Assessments of subjective symptoms and objective findings, electrocardiograms, physical examination, and laboratory tests were performed before and up to 7 days after the injection to assess the safety of (99m)Tc-EF. Blood and urine collections and whole-body planar imaging were conducted at various time points up to 24 h after the injection to assess the pharmacokinetics of (99m)Tc-EF. The internal radiation dosimetry was calculated based on the pharmacokinetics results using the MIRD method. Five adverse events were observed in three subjects (50 %) after administration of the folic acid and (99m)Tc-EF, while these events were mild and non-serious. Of those five events, three were considered to be related to the administered agents. The radioactivity in blood rapidly decreased and showed a biphasic profile. The activity of (99m)Tc-EF at 5 min post injection was largest in the bone marrow, followed by the liver and kidneys, and had decreased within 24 h in all organs/tissues without appreciable retention. The pharmacokinetics results suggested that (99m)Tc-EF was mainly eliminated by kidney. The results also suggested that when administered at 925 MBq of (99m)Tc-EF, which is the maximum dose generally used for clinical trials in other countries, the corresponding effective dose of (99m)Tc-EF is equal to or less than those determined for the current radioactive diagnostic imaging agents. The results of this study assessing the safety and radiation dosimetry of (99m)Tc-EF with folic acid pre-administration suggested that folic acid and (99m)Tc-EF should be appropriate for further studies. No pharmacokinetics concerns were noted.",

In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FR\u03b1-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FR\u03b1 tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent, (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion diagnostic with the FR\u03b1-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to identify patients whose tumors express FR\u03b1. Vintafolide is a folic acid conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FR\u03b1-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization. (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FR\u03b1 expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors, indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FR\u03b1 and FR\u03b2 in complex with folates and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders.",

The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole body after injection of Etarfolatide. Scans and knee radiographs were scored blinded to clinical information including knee and other joint site pain severity. Measures of association controlled for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and employed repeated measures to adjust for correlation between knees. Activated macrophages were present in the majority (76%) of knees. The quantity of knee-related macrophages was significantly associated with knee pain severity (R = 0.60, P &lt; 0.0001) and radiographic knee OA severity including joint space narrowing (R = 0.68, P = 0.007), and osteophyte (R = 0.66, P = 0.001). Macrophages were also localized to joints commonly affected by OA including hand finger joints (12%), thumb bases (28%), shoulders (26%), great toes (18%) and ankles (12%). The presence of joint pain at fingers, wrists, ankles and great toes was significantly positively associated with presence of activated macrophages at these sites (P &lt; 0.0001-0.04). This study provides the first direct in vivo evidence for macrophage involvement in OA in a substantial proportion of human knees. The association of quantity of activated macrophages with radiographic knee OA severity and joint symptoms suggests that drugs targeting macrophages and macrophage-associated inflammatory pathways may have the potential to be both symptom and structure modifying.",

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plays a critical role in fibrinolysis. PAI-1 expression is increased in both experimental APAP-induced liver injury and patients with acute liver failure. Prior studies have shown that PAI-1 prevents intrahepatic hemorrhage and mortality after APAP challenge, but the downstream mechanisms are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that PAI-1 limits liver-related morbidity after APAP challenge by reducing tPA-dependent fibrinolysis. Compared with APAP-challenged (300 mg/kg) wild-type mice, hepatic deposition of cross-linked fibrin was reduced, with intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage increased in PAI-1-deficient mice 24 hours after APAP overdose. Administration of recombinant wild-type human PAI-1 reduced intrahepatic hemorrhage 24 hours after APAP challenge in PAI-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas a mutant PAI-1 lacking antiprotease function had no effect. Of interest, tPA deficiency alone did not affect APAP-induced liver damage. In contrast, fibrinolysis, intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage, and mortality driven by PAI-1 deficiency were reduced in APAP-treated tPA<sup>-/-</sup>/PAI-1<sup>-/-</sup> double-knockout mice. The results identify PAI-1 as a critical regulator of intrahepatic fibrinolysis in experimental liver injury.

Highly induced during luteolysis, it acts as a natural anti-angiogenic, proapoptotic compound. THBS1 expression is regulated in bovine luteal endothelial cells (LECs) by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) acting in an opposite manner. Here we sought to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting THBS1 and investigate their possible involvement in FGF2 and TGFB1-mediated THBS1 expression. Several miRNAs predicted to target THBS1 mRNA (miR-1, miR-18a, miR-144, miR-194, and miR-221) were experimentally tested. Of these, miR-221 was shown to efficiently target THBS1 expression and function in LECs. We found that this miRNA is highly expressed in luteal cells and in mid-cycle CL. Consistent with the inhibition of THBS1 function, miR-221 also reduced Serpin Family E Member 1 [SERPINE1] in LECs and promoted angiogenic characteristics of LECs. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the gene product of SERPINE1, inhibited cell adhesion, suggesting that PAI-1, like THBS1, has anti-angiogenic properties. Importantly, FGF2, which negatively regulates THBS1, elevates miR-221. Conversely, TGFB1 that stimulates THBS1, significantly reduces miR-221. Furthermore, FGF2 enhances the suppression of THBS1 caused by miR-221 mimic, and prevents the increase in THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. In contrast, TGFB1 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-221 mimic on THBS1, and enhances the upregulation of THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. These data support the contention that FGF2 and TGFB1 modulate THBS1 via miR-221. These in vitro data propose that dynamic regulation of miR-221 throughout the cycle, affecting THBS1 and SERPINE1, can modulate vascular function in the CL.",

Preclinical models provide evidence of immunotherapy-radiotherapy (IM-RT) synergy. The exposure to ionizing radiation turns tumor in an in-situ vaccine, primes the innate immune system, increases immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of immune-resistant tumors and promotes a systemic, out-of-field antitumor T-cell-mediated response called abscopal effect. The immunomodulatory and abscopal effects of radiotherapy can be further enhanced by combining with systemic immunotherapies. The phase III START trial proved that liposomal vaccine - tecemotide (L-BLP25) administered as maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LA-NSCLC prolongs survival. In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Inhibitors of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can unleash anti-tumor immunity and mediate cancer regressions.

However, early animal studies have demonstrated that after CTLA-4 inhibition and PD-1 deletion autoimmune myocarditis can occur. Moreover, PD-1 and PD-L1 can be expressed in rodent and human cardiomyocytes. During the last years several cases of fatal heart failure have been documented in melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors. The recent experience with cardiovascular toxic effects associated with checkpoint inhibitors introduces important concepts biologically and clinically relevant for future oncology trials and clinical practice.",

A search using clinicaltrials.gov was conducted to identify studies for atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. English language phase I to III studies assessing PD-1 and PD-L1 in UC were incorporated. Atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicities in patients with metastatic UC with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies may provide overall survival advantage; these are currently being evaluated in ongoing phase 3 studies. Greater objective response rates seem to be observed in PD-L1-positive patients versus PD-L1-negative patients, but methodologies in this assessment differ among clinical trials. The identification of biomarkers that provide greater insight into patients who positively respond to PD-1/PD-L1 therapies are needed. Treatment options for metastatic UC have expanded to include PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. These agents should be strongly considered as second-line therapy over single-agent chemotherapy for patients who fail or progress after platinum-based treatment.",

An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. A formal systematic analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2.2). Clinical and demographic characteristics, response, and toxicity data were compared between both groups. A total of 23 studies reported between 2013 and 2016 were eligible for analysis. The total number of patients evaluated for toxicities was 3284 patients in the PD-1 group and 2460 patients in the PD-L1 group. The baseline patient characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, although there was a trend toward increased squamous histology in the group treated with PD-L1 (32% vs 25%; P = .6). There was no difference in response rate noted between PD-1 (19%) and PD-L1 (18.6%) inhibitors (P = .17). The incidence of overall adverse events (AEs) was comparable between the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors (64% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 63%-66%] vs 66% [95% CI, 65%-69%]; P = .8). Fatigue was the most frequently reported AE with both classes of drugs. Patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were found to have a slightly increased rate of immune-related AEs (16% [95% CI, 14%-17%] vs 11% [95% CI, 10%-13%]; P = .07) and pneumonitis (4% [95% CI, 3%-5%] vs 2% [95% CI, 1%-3%]; P = .01) compared with patients who received PD-L1 inhibitors.

We hypothesize the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, durvalumab, olaparib, or cediranib combinations are tolerable and active in recurrent women's cancers. Patients and Methods This phase I study tested durvalumab doublets in parallel 3 + 3 dose escalations. Durvalumab was administered at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1,500 mg every 4 weeks with either olaparib tablets twice daily or cediranib on two schedules. The primary end point was the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Response rate and pharmacokinetic analysis were secondary end points. Results Between June 2015 and May 2016, 26 women were enrolled. The RP2D was durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks with olaparib 300 mg twice a day, or cediranib 20 mg, 5 days on/2 days off. No dose-limiting toxicity was recorded with durvalumab plus olaparib. The cediranib intermittent schedule (n = 6) was examined because of recurrent grade 2 and non-dose-limiting toxicity grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) on the daily schedule (n = 8). Treatment-emergent AEs included hypertension (two of eight), diarrhea (two of eight), pulmonary embolism (two of eight), pulmonary hypertension (one of eight), and lymphopenia (one of eight). Durvalumab plus intermittent cediranib grade 3 and 4 AEs were hypertension (one of six) and fatigue (one of six). Exposure to durvalumab increased cediranib area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration on the daily, but not intermittent, schedules. Two partial responses (\u226515 months and \u2265 11 months) and eight stable diseases \u2265 4 months (median, 8 months [4 to 14.5 months]) were seen in patients who received durvalumab plus olaparib, yielding an 83% disease control rate. Six partial responses (\u2265 5 to \u2265 8 months) and three stable diseases \u2265 4 months (4 to \u2265 8 months) were seen in 12 evaluable patients who received durvalumab plus cediranib, for a 50% response rate and a 75% disease control rate. Response to therapy was independent of PD-L1 expression. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first reported anti-PD-L1 plus olaparib or cediranib combination therapy. The RP2Ds of durvalumab plus olaparib and durvalumab plus intermittent cediranib are tolerable and active. Phase II studies with biomarker evaluation are ongoing.",

Combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab might provide greater antitumour activity than either drug alone. We aimed to assess durvalumab plus tremelimumab in patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We did a multicentre, non-randomised, open-label, phase 1b study at five cancer centres in the USA. We enrolled immunotherapy-naive patients aged 18 years or older with confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. We gave patients durvalumab in doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, or 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and tremelimumab in doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks for six doses then every 12 weeks for three doses. The primary endpoint of the dose-escalation phase was safety. Safety analyses were based on the as-treated population. The dose-expansion phase of the study is ongoing.

At the time of this analysis (June 1, 2015), median follow-up was 18\u00b78 weeks (IQR 11-33). The maximum tolerated dose was exceeded in the cohort receiving durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 3 mg/kg, with two (30%) of six patients having a dose-limiting toxicity (one grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and one grade 4 increased lipase). The most frequent treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (11 [11%]), colitis (nine [9%]), and increased lipase (eight [8%]). Discontinuations attributable to treatment-related adverse events occurred in 29 (28%) of 102 patients. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 37 (36%) of 102 patients. 22 patients died during the study, and three deaths were related to treatment. The treatment-related deaths were due to complications arising from myasthenia gravis (durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 1 mg/kg), pericardial effusion (durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 1 mg/kg), and neuromuscular disorder (durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 3 mg/kg). Evidence of clinical activity was noted both in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours and in those with PD-L1-negative tumours. Investigator-reported confirmed objective responses were achieved by six (23%, 95% CI 9-44) of 26 patients in the combined tremelimumab 1 mg/kg cohort, comprising two (22%, 95% CI 3-60) of nine patients with PD-L1-positive tumours and four (29%, 95% CI 8-58) of 14 patients with PD-L1-negative tumours, including those with no PD-L1 staining (four [40%, 95% CI 12-74] of ten patients).

One strategy is to modify the read-alignment algorithms by integrating the logic related to BS-seq alignment, with the goal of making the software implementation amenable to optimizations that lead to higher speed and greater sensitivity than might otherwise be attainable. We evaluated this strategy using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate computationally-expensive programming logic.

We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's reported alignments with the alignments reported by well-known CPU-based BS-seq read aligners. With simulated reads, Arioc's accuracy is equal to or better than the other read aligners we evaluated. With human sequencing reads, Arioc's throughput is at least 10 times faster than existing BS-seq aligners across a wide range of sensitivity settings.

Here we tested whether the survival benefits seen with the combination arise from the enhanced reduction of chemoresidual disease and leukemic initiating cells (LICs). Herein, we use cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) AML models to evaluate the combination of GO with daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) induction chemotherapy on AML blast growth and animal survival. DA chemotherapy and GO as separate treatments reduced AML burden but left significant chemoresidual disease in multiple AML models. The combination of GO and DA chemotherapy eliminated nearly all AML burden and extended overall survival. In two small subsets of AML models, chemoresidual disease following DA chemotherapy displayed hallmark markers of leukemic LICs (CLL1 and CD34). In vivo, the two chemoresistant subpopulations (CLL1+/CD117- and CD34+/CD38+) showed higher ability to self-renewal than their counterpart subpopulations, respectively. CD33 was coexpressed in these functional LIC subpopulations. We demonstrate that the GO and DA induction chemotherapy combination more effectively eliminates LICs in AML PDX models than either single agent alone.

Experimental validation using a Pafah1b1 conditional knock-out mouse confirmed that this gene is associated with an increased preference for alcohol and an altered thermoregulatory response to alcohol. Although this gene has not been previously implicated in alcohol-related behaviors, its function in various neural mechanisms makes a role in alcohol-related phenomena plausible. By making diverse cross-species functional genomics data readily computable, we were able to identify and confirm a novel alcohol-related gene that may have implications for alcohol use disorders and other effects of alcohol.",

However, a major challenge lies in assembling and harmonizing heterogeneous data sets across species for facile comparison to the positional candidate genes and coexpression networks that come from systems genetic studies. GeneWeaver is an online database and suite of tools at www.geneweaver.org that allows for fast aggregation and analysis of gene set-centric data. GeneWeaver contains curated experimental data together with resource-level data such as GO annotations, MP annotations, and KEGG pathways, along with persistent stores of user entered data sets. These can be entered directly into GeneWeaver or transferred from widely used resources such as GeneNetwork.org. Data are analyzed using statistical tools and advanced graph algorithms to discover new relations, prioritize candidate genes, and generate function hypotheses. Here we use GeneWeaver to find genes common to multiple gene sets, prioritize candidate genes from a quantitative trait locus, and characterize a set of differentially expressed genes. Coupling a large multispecies repository curated and empirical functional genomics data to fast computational tools allows for the rapid integrative analysis of heterogeneous data for interpreting and extrapolating systems genetics results.",

In order to adapt this model for examining related molecular components and biological networks, such as pathway or gene network data, we have developed a means to leverage the bipartite data structure to extract and analyze shared edges. Using the Pathway Commons database we demonstrate the ability to rapidly identify shared connected components among a diverse set of pathways. In addition, we illustrate how results from maximal bipartite discovery can be decomposed into hierarchical relationships, allowing shared pathway components to be mapped through various parent-child relationships to help visualization and discovery of emergent kernel driven relationships. Interrogating common relationships among biological networks and conventional GeneWeaver gene lists will increase functional specificity and reliability of the shared biological components. This approach enables self-organization of biological processes through shared biological networks.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731198": " Integrating and analyzing heterogeneous genome-scale data is a huge algorithmic challenge for modern systems biology. Bipartite graphs can be useful for representing relationships across pairs of disparate data types, with the interpretation of these relationships accomplished through an enumeration of maximal bicliques. Most previously-known techniques are generally ill-suited to this foundational task, because they are relatively inefficient and without effective scaling. In this paper, a powerful new algorithm is described that produces all maximal bicliques in a bipartite graph. Unlike most previous approaches, the new method neither places undue restrictions on its input nor inflates the problem size. Efficiency is achieved through an innovative exploitation of bipartite graph structure, and through computational reductions that rapidly eliminate non-maximal candidates from the search space. An iterative selection of vertices for consideration based on non-decreasing common neighborhood sizes boosts efficiency and leads to more balanced recursion trees. The new technique is implemented and compared to previously published approaches from graph theory and data mining. Formal time and space bounds are derived. Experiments are performed on both random graphs and graphs constructed from functional genomics data. It is shown that the new method substantially outperforms the best previous alternatives. The new method is streamlined, efficient, and particularly well-suited to the study of huge and diverse biological data. A robust implementation has been incorporated into GeneWeaver, an online tool for integrating and analyzing functional genomics experiments, available at http://geneweaver.org. The enormous increase in scalability it provides empowers users to study complex and previously unassailable gene-set associations between genes and their biological functions in a hierarchical fashion and on a genome-wide scale.

Data from multiple such publications and public data resources have been incorporated in the GeneWeaver database with &gt;60,000 gene sets including 285 alcohol withdrawal and preference-related gene sets. Among these are evidence for positional candidates regulating these behaviors in overlapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapped in distinct mouse populations. Combinatorial integration of functional genomics experimental results revealed a single QTL positional candidate gene in one of the loci common to both preference and withdrawal. Functional validation studies in Ap3m2 knockout mice confirmed these relationships. Genetic validation involves confirming the existence of segregating polymorphisms that could account for the phenotypic effect. By exploiting recent advances in mouse genotyping, sequence, epigenetics, and phylogeny resources, we confirmed that Ap3m2 resides in an appropriately segregating genomic region. We have demonstrated genetic and alcohol-induced regulation of Ap3m2 expression. Although sequence analysis revealed no polymorphisms in the Ap3m2-coding region that could account for all phenotypic differences, there are several upstream SNPs that could. We have identified one of these to be an H3K4me3 site that exhibits strain differences in methylation. Thus, by making cross-species functional genomics readily computable we identified a common QTL candidate for two related bio-behavioral processes via functional evidence and demonstrate sufficiency of the genetic locus as a source of variation underlying two traits.",

It results clinically in cramps and fasciculations. It is not specific to motor neuron diseases, and can occur in healthy subjects, as well as in various pathologies of the peripheral nervous system, including nerve hyperexcitability syndromes. Hyperexcitability plays an important and debated role in the pathophysiology of motor neuron diseases, especially in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mechanisms causing hyperexcitability are not yet clearly identified. While most studies favor a distal axonal origin site of fasciculations, some of the fasciculations could be of cortical origin. The consequences of hyperexcitability are also discussed, whether it is rather protective or deleterious in the disease course. Fasciculations are depicted both clinically and using electromyogram, and more recently the interest of ultrasound has been highlighted. The importance of fasciculation potentials in the diagnosis of ALS led to changes in electrophysiological criteria at Awaji consensus conference. The contribution of these modifications to ALS diagnosis has been the subject of several studies.

MEDLINE and Web of Science (until October2011). We searched for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of the Awaji criteria vs the revised El Escorial criteria in patients referred with suspected ALS. Evaluation and data extraction of identified studies were done independently. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies list was used to assess study quality. We determined the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS and derived indices of diagnostic performance(sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio). Quantitative data synthesis was accomplished through random-effects meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 test. Eight studies were included (3 prospective and 5 retrospective) enrolling 1187 patients. Application of Awaji criteria led to a 23% (95% CI, 12% to 33%; I2=84%) increase in the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS.

Although the diagnosis appears obvious in theory, clinical practice shows the contrary as diagnosis is delayed in many patients; the average time between symptom onset and diagnosis can reach 12 months. The delay can be explained by the variability of the clinical presentation and by the absence of diagnostic markers. In order to standardize diagnosis for enrollment in clinical research, diagnostic criteria for ALS were created and revisited during the last 20 years. In 2006, the Awaji criteria for the diagnosis of ALS were proposed, adding two major points to the diagnostic criteria: electromyography is considered equivalent to clinical examination for the identification of LMN signs and fasciculation potentials resume their prominent place in the diagnosis. Comparisons of the accuracy of the revisited El Escorial and Awaji criteria support improved diagnostic sensitivity without any effect on specificity with the new classification. The only weakness of the new classification involves patients with UMN signs in one region and LMN in two regions; these patients were previously classified as laboratory-supported probable ALS and currently as possible ALS, a lower level of diagnostic certainty. In all other instances the accuracy appears to be improved by the Awaji criteria. Nevertheless, there is a body of evidence suggesting the need for a revision of these new criteria, giving more weight to clinical and complementary findings of UMN involvement. The need to diagnose and treat ALS quickly could be facilitated by the inclusion of complementary investigations that detect UMN signs.",

The objective for this study was to elucidate whether electrophysiological criteria set for AC detects ALS earlier than REEC's counterpart in patients with ALS. Of the 51 patients who were clinically suspected of ALS, 35 patients prospectively received serial electrophysiological studies every 3 months until (1) both electrophysiological AC and REEC criteria were met in more than two muscles representing both of the cervical and lumbosacral segments or (2) either clinically definite or clinically probable REEC criteria was met. The intervals were determined between the initial disease onset and when the respective electrophysiological criteria were met. Electrophysiological diagnostic criteria were met in 94.3% by AC and 40% by REEC at the initial visits. The intervals between the disease onset and the time of meeting the electrophysiological criteria were shorter in AC (mean: 9.0 months) than in REEC (mean: 15.2 months) (P&lt;0.01). Eleven patients who met only AC electrophysiological criteria on the initial study subsequently met REEC electrophysiological criteria with the mean interval of 3.8 months.

Medical and electrophysiological records of 135 consecutive patients with ALS and 25 patients with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) who underwent electrophysiological examination of at least three anatomical regions were analysed retrospectively. Results showed that implementation of the Awaji criteria increased the level of ALS diagnosis sensitivity in 5.9% of cases - 1.5% due to the new role of FPs potentials and 4.4% because of equalization of clinical and EMG findings. In 4% of patients the ALS diagnosis was, however, changed from laboratory-supported probable ALS to possible ALS.

Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months.

The investigators who did the index test were masked to the results of the reference test and all other investigations. The primary outcome measures were the sensitivity and specificity of TMS in differentiating ALS from non-ALS disorders; these measures were derived from receiver operator curve analysis. Between Jan 1, 2010, and March 1, 2014, we screened 333 patients; 281 met our inclusion criteria.

The proportion of the patients with definite or probable ALS was 48% by revised El Escorial criteria and 79% by Awaji criteria using US. Muscle US is a practical and efficient tool to detect fasciculations, particularly in the tongue. A combination of US and EMG substantially increases the diagnostic sensitivity of ALS.",

In order to improve the diagnostic sensitivity for ALS, Awaji criteria were developed, in part to better incorporate neurophysiological measures, although assessment of upper motor neuron dysfunction remained clinically based. Given that cortical hyperexcitability appears to be an early feature in ALS, the present study assessed the diagnostic utility of a threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation technique as an aid to the research-based Awaji criteria in establishing an earlier diagnosis of ALS. Prospective studies were undertaken on a cohort of 82 patients with suspected ALS and results were compared with 34 healthy controls. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was significantly reduced in ALS patients (P &lt; 0.0001), with a comparable reduction evident in the Awaji groups (SICIAWAJI POSSIBLE 1.3% \u00b1 1.3%; SICIAWAJI PROBABLE/DEFINITE 1.4% \u00b11.7%). Central motor conduction time was significantly prolonged (P &lt; 0.001), whereas the motor evoked potential amplitude (P &lt; 0.05) and intracortical facilitation (P &lt; 0.05) were increased. The frequency of transcranial magnetic stimulation abnormalities was similar across Awaji subgroups, and addition of transcranial magnetic stimulation abnormalities as a diagnostic category enabled reclassification of 88% of Awaji possible patients to Awaji probable/definite. Cortical excitability studies potentially facilitate an earlier diagnosis of ALS when combined with clinical and conventional neurophysiological findings, albeit in a research setting.",

We performed descriptive analyses of data on demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory evaluations, and vaccination coverage. From March 24, 2014, through July 23, 2014, a total of 383 outbreak-related cases of measles were reported in nine counties in Ohio. The median age of case patients was 15 years (range, &lt;1 to 53); a total of 178 of the case patients (46%) were female, and 340 (89%) were unvaccinated. Transmission took place primarily within households (68% of cases). The virus strain was genotype D9, which was circulating in the Philippines at the time of the reporting period. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage with at least a single dose was estimated to be 14% in affected Amish households and more than 88% in the general (non-Amish) Ohio community. Containment efforts included isolation of case patients, quarantine of susceptible persons, and administration of the MMR vaccine to more than 10,000 persons. The spread of measles was limited almost exclusively to the Amish community (accounting for 99% of case patients) and affected only approximately 1% of the estimated 32,630 Amish persons in the settlement. The key epidemiologic features of a measles outbreak in the Amish community in Ohio were transmission primarily within households, the small proportion of Amish people affected, and the large number of people in the Amish community who sought vaccination. As a result of targeted containment efforts, and high baseline coverage in the general community, there was limited spread beyond the Amish community.

One exemplar gene is HUWE1, which has been found to be mutated in numerous studies. However, due to the large size of this gene and a lack of functional analysis of identified mutations, their significance to carcinogenesis is unclear. To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours. Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins.",

It belongs to a group of MHC-I-associated inflammatory disorders, also including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and Beh\u00e7et's disease, for which endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases (ERAP) 1 and/or 2 have been identified as genetic risk factors. Since both enzymes are involved in the processing of MHC-I ligands, it seems reasonable that common peptide-mediated mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of these diseases. In this study, comparative immunopeptidomics was used to characterize &gt;5000 A*29:02 ligands and quantify the effects of ERAP1 polymorphism and expression on the A*29:02 peptidome in human cells. The peptides predominant in an active ERAP1 context showed a higher frequency of nonamers and bulkier amino acid side chains at multiple positions, compared with the peptides predominant in a less active ERAP1 background. Thus, ERAP1 polymorphism has a large influence, shaping the A*29:02 peptidome through length-dependent and length-independent effects. These changes resulted in increased affinity and hydrophobicity of A*29:02 ligands in an active ERAP1 context. The results reveal the nature of the functional interaction between A*29:02 and ERAP1 and suggest that this enzyme may affect the susceptibility to birdshot chorioretinopathy by altering the A*29:02 peptidome.

This phase Ib study evaluated alpelisib plus letrozole's safety, tolerability, and preliminary activity in patients with metastatic ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer refractory to endocrine therapy. Twenty-six patients received letrozole and alpelisib daily. Outcomes were assessed by standard solid-tumor phase I methods. Tumor blocks were collected for DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing. Alpelisib's maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with letrozole was 300 mg/d. Common drug-related adverse events included hyperglycemia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and rash with dose-limiting toxicity occurring at 350 mg/d of alpelisib. The clinical benefit rate (lack of progression \u22656 months) was 35% (44% in patients with PIK3CA-mutated and 20% in PIK3CA wild-type tumors; 95% CI, 17%-56%), including five objective responses. Of eight patients remaining on treatment \u226512 months, six had tumors with a PIK3CA mutation. Among evaluable tumors, those with FGFR1/2 amplification and KRAS and TP53 mutations did not derive clinical benefit. Overexpression of FGFR1 in ER<sup>+</sup>/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells attenuated the response to alpelisib in vitro CONCLUSIONS: The combination of letrozole and alpelisib was safe, with reversible toxicities.

One of the crucial mechanisms underlying hormonal therapy resistance is the collateral activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. We explored whether PI3K inhibitors, buparlisib and alpelisib, enhance the efficacy of tamoxifen against ER-positive BC cells. We have observed a synergism between alpelisib or buparlisib and tamoxifen in the treatment for ER-positive BC cell lines harboring different PI3K alterations. Immunoblotting analysis showed alpelisib, buparlisib, or either drug in combination with tamoxifen downregulated the PI3K downstream targets in the MCF-7 and ZR75-1 cells. In the MCF-7 cells transfected with a constitutive active (myristoylated) AKT1 construct or mutant ER, the synergistic effect between alpelisib and tamoxifen was markedly attenuated, indicating that synergism depends on AKT inhibition or normally functioning ER. Combining alpelisib or buparlisib with tamoxifen also attenuated MCF-7 tumor growth in Balb/c nude mice. Our data suggest that additional PI3K blockade might be effective in enhancing the therapeutic effect of tamoxifen in ER-positive BC and support the rationale combination in clinical trials.",

Yet, along with their common fundamental role in protecting genomic fidelity, each has acquired distinct functions related to diverse cell autonomous and non-autonomous processes. Similar to the p53 family, the Hippo signaling pathway impacts a multitude of cellular processes, spanning from cell cycle and metabolism to development and tumor suppression. The core Hippo module consists of the tumor-suppressive MST-LATS kinases and oncogenic transcriptional co-effectors YAP and TAZ. A wealth of accumulated data suggests a complex and delicate regulatory network connecting the p53 and Hippo pathways, in a highly context-specific manner. This generates multiple layers of interaction, ranging from interdependent and collaborative signaling to apparent antagonistic activity. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic alterations can disrupt this homeostatic network, paving the way to genomic instability and cancer. This strengthens the need to better understand the nuances that control the molecular function of each component and the cross-talk between the different components. Here, we review interactions between the p53 and Hippo pathways within a subset of physiological contexts, focusing on normal stem cells and development, as well as regulation of apoptosis, senescence and metabolism in transformed cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28937686": "The tumor suppressor p53 is a key regulator of apoptosis induced by various cellular stresses. p53 can induce apoptosis by two mechanisms. First, p53 acts as a transcription factor inducing and repressing pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic targets genes, respectively. Second, p53 is able to translocate to the mitochondria, where it interacts with BCL-2 family members to induce membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. p53 transcriptional activity is regulated by a set of post-translational modifications that have been well documented. However, how these modifications impact the direct mitochondrial pathway of death remain poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the role of serine 392 phosphorylation in the control of p53-dependent apoptosis. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to substitute serine 392 by a non-phosphorylatable alanine in HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells. The S392A mutant displayed normal transcriptional activity following genotoxic stress, but markedly impaired ability to localize to mitochondria. The decreased mitochondrial localization of the S392A mutant correlated with a lower ability to induce apoptosis. Confirmatory observations were made following enforced expression of the S392A p53 mutant or a phospho-mimetic S392E mutant in H1299 lung carcinoma cells. Our observations support the premise that serine 392 phosphorylation of p53 influences its mitochondrial translocation and transcription-independent apoptotic function.",

Direct functional restoration of p53 as a transcription factor has been difficult to achieve in the clinic. We performed a functional screen using a bioluminescence-based transcriptional read-out to identify small molecules that restore the p53 pathway in mutant p53-bearing cancer cells. We identified CB002, as a candidate that restores p53 function in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer cells and without toxicity to normal human fibroblasts. Cells exposed to CB002 show increased expression of endogenous p53 target genes NOXA, DR5, and p21 and cell death which occurs by 16 hours, as measured by cleaved caspases or PARP. Stable knockdown of NOXA completely abrogates PARP cleavage and reduces sub-G1 content, implicating NOXA as the key mediator of cell death induction by CB002. Moreover, CB002 decreases the stability of mutant p53 in RXF393 cancer cells and an exogenously expressed R175H p53 mutant in HCT116 p53-null cells. R175H p53 expression was rescued by addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132 to CB002, suggesting a role for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the mutant protein. In summary, CB002, a p53 pathway-restoring compound that targets mutant p53 for degradation and induces tumor cell death through NOXA, may be further developed as a cancer therapeutic.",

It has the potential to significantly delay aggregation of the protein by steric shielding, a frequently encountered issue in the development of protein drugs. Moreover, it can modify the pharmacokinetic profile of the PEGylated protein by delaying renal excretion, leading to a longer half-life (t1/2) of the drug. By steric hindrance, it can also inhibit interactions between the protein drug and proteases as well as the host immune system, thereby inhibiting inactivation of the PEGylated protein and also attenuating its immunogenicity. Unfortunately, the effect of steric hindrance also applies to protein drug-target interaction, leading to a (partial) loss of efficacy. In order to avoid this undesirable effect, several efforts have been made to link PEG to a protein in a noncovalent way, providing the protein with several of the beneficial effects of PEGylation while also taking advantage of its native affinity to its target.",

The IOP of elderly (24-month-old, N=12) and adult (6-8month-old, N=10) Brown Norway rats was elevated in 10mmHg increments from 10 to 100mmHg. At each IOP level, 3D OCT data were captured using an optical microangiography (OMAG) scanning protocol and then post-processed to obtain both structural and vascular images. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate, pulse and blood oxygen saturation were monitored non-invasively throughout each experiment. Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated as the difference between MAP for each animal and IOP at each level. The capillary filling index (CFI), defined as the ratio of area occupied by functional capillary vessels to the total scan area but excluding relatively large vessels of &gt;30\u03bcm, was calculated at each IOP level and analyzed using the OCTA angiograms. Relative CFI vs IOP was plotted for the group means. CFI vs OPP was plotted for every animal in each group and data from all animals were combined in a CFI vs OPP scatter plot comparing the two groups. The MAP in adult animals was 108\u00b15mmHg (mean\u00b1SD), whereas this value in the elderly was 99\u00b15mmHg. All other physiologic parameters for both age groups were uniform and stable. In elderly animals, significant reduction of the CFI was first noted at IOP 40mmHg, as opposed to 60mmHg in adult animals. Individual assessment of CFI as a function of OPP for adult animals revealed a consistent plateau until OPP reached between 40 and 60mmHg. Elderly individuals demonstrated greater variability, with many showing a beginning of gradual deterioration of CFI at an OPP as high as 80mmHg. Overall comparison of CFI vs OPP between the two groups was not statistically significant. Compared to adults, some, but not all, elderly animals demonstrate a more rapid deterioration of CFI vs OPP. This suggests a reduced autoregulatory capacity that may contribute to increased glaucoma susceptibility in some older individuals. This variability must be considered when studying the relationship between IOP, ocular perfusion and glaucoma in elderly animal models.",

In total, 50 eyes from 50 patients diagnosed with PD and 54 eyes of 54 healthy controls underwent retinal and choroidal assessment using SS DRI Triton OCT (Topcon), using the 3D Wide protocol. Total macular thickness and peripapillary data (retinal, ganglion cell layer [GCL+, GCL++] and retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] thickness) were analyzed. Macular and peripapillary choroidal thickness was evaluated (Figure 1). Significant peripapillary retinal thinning was observed in PD patients in total average (p = 0.017), in the nasal (p = 0.038) and temporal (p = 0.004) quadrants and in superotemporal (p = 0.004), nasal (p = 0.039), inferotemporal (p = 0.019), and temporal (p = 0.003) sectors. RNFL and GCL ++ thickness showed a significant reduction in the inferotemporal sector (p = 0.026 and 0.009, respectively). No differences were observed in macular retinal thickness between controls and patients.

FITC-DEX uptake was evident in spiral ganglion cells (SGs), the organ of Corti (OC), and the lateral walls (LWs), the basal turns of which were stained relatively prominently in both groups. Animals receiving IP injections exhibited higher FITC-DEX uptakes by the SGs and OC, whereas IT injection triggered higher-level FITC-DEX accumulation by the OC and LWs. Flow cytometry revealed that intracochlear FITC-DEX uptake by IT-injected animals was higher and more prolonged than in animals subjected to IP injections.

The pathologic correlate of Meniere's disease is endolymphatic hydrops and the etiopathogenesis involves a deficiency in the absorption of endolymph. The pathophysiology of the symptoms is still disputed: membranous ruptures, pressure and mechanical displacement of the end organs, or obstruction followed by an abrupt clearance of the endolymphatic duct. The course of the disease may be progressive or nonprogressive and, in addition to the typical presentation of Meniere's disease, two variations of the disorder have been identified: cochlear Meniere's disease, and vestibular Meniere's disease. It can be further broken into two subsets: Meniere's syndrome, with a known and well-established cause, and Meniere's disease, in which the cause seems to be idiopathic. It is likely that there are racial (genetic) as well as environmental factors that influence differences in incidence among countries and among various sections of countries. The disease is much more common in adults, with an average age of onset in the fourth decade, the symptoms beginning usually between ages 20 and 60 years. Meniere's disease is (grossly) equally common in each sex, and right and left ears are affected with fairly equal frequency. The diagnosis of Meniere's disease is by exclusion, and a careful history is the most important guide to a correct diagnosis. Its medical treatment is largely empiric. Surgery can be considered when, even after medical therapy, the disease progresses and the symptoms become intractable. Surgery may be either conservative or destructive. Bilaterality must be considered when deciding the best surgical option for a patient with Meniere's disease. It is the authors' opinion that endolymphatic sac surgery is an extension of conservative treatment.",

The 4D-CHAINS algorithm analyzes two 4D spectra recorded using a single, fully protonated protein sample in an iterative ansatz where common NOEs between different spin systems supplement conventional through-bond connectivities to establish assignments of sidechain and backbone resonances at high levels of completeness and with a minimum error rate. The 4D-CHAINS assignments are then used to guide automated assignment of long-range NOEs and structure refinement in autoNOE-Rosetta.

Red raspberry (RB) contains high amounts of dietary fibers and polyphenolic compounds, which are known for their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. This study evaluated the preventive effects of RB supplementation on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and associated metabolic abnormalities induced by high fat diet (HFD). Wild-type male mice (six weeks old) were randomized into 4 groups receiving a control or typical western HFD supplemented with or without 5% freeze-dried RB for 12 weeks, when mice were sacrificed for tissue collection. HFD feeding substantially increased body weight, which was alleviated by RB supplementation towards the end of the feeding trial. Dietary RB restored the baseline blood glucose level, ameliorating glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, which were aggravated by HFD. Additionally, HFD reduced O<sub>2</sub> expenditure and CO<sub>2</sub> production, which were ameliorated by RB consumption. The liver is the key site for energy metabolism and a key peripheral tissue responsive to insulin. RB supplementation reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD mice. In agreement, RB consumption suppressed hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production in HFD mice, accompanied with normalized mitochondriogenesis. These results suggest that RB consumption improves insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obesity, which is concomitant with suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome elicited by HFD. Thus, dietary RB intake is a promising strategy for ameliorating diet-induced metabolic abnormalities.",

The efficiency of intravenous cardiomyoplasty by infusion of MSC was evaluated in female Wistar-Kyoto rats with myocardial infarction model using echocardiography, morphological study, morphometry, immunohistostaining, data from in situ hybridization, and by measurement of blood serum levels of nitric oxide, endothelin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). The transplanted MSC were detected in all layers of the myocardium; MCS actively participate in the formation of blood vessels and connective tissue in the scar zone. There was no observable differentiation of male MSC into cardiomyocytes in female rats with MI. However, MSC transplantation leads to significant improvement in vascularization in the area of MI, elevation blood serum levels of nitric oxide, VEGF, and FGF2. No significant differences were identified morphologically between the two groups of animals after transplantation with unmodified MSC or commited MSC (5-azaC).

To what extent epigenetic information on promoters of lineage-specification genes in human progenitors influences transcriptional activation and differentiation potential remains unclear. We produced bisulfite sequencing maps of DNA methylation in adipogenic, myogenic, and endothelial promoters in relation to gene expression and differentiation capacity, and unravel a similarity in DNA methylation profiles between MSCs isolated from human adipose tissue, bone marrow (BM), and muscle. This similarity is irrespective of promoter CpG content. Methylation patterns of MSCs are distinct from those of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and multipotent hESC-derived mesenchymal cells (MCs). Moreover, in vitro MSC differentiation does not affect lineage-specific promoter methylation states, arguing that these methylation patterns in differentiated cells are already established at the progenitor stage. Further, we find a correlation between lineage-specific promoter hypermethylation and lack of differentiation capacity toward that lineage, but no relationship between weak promoter methylation and capacity of transcriptional activation or differentiation. Thus, only part of the restriction in differentiation capacity of tissue-specific stem cells is programmed by promoter DNA methylation: hypermethylation seems to constitute a barrier to differentiation, however, no or weak methylation has no predictive value for differentiation potential.",

In this MiniReview, we describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, efficacy and side effects of the combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696. We summarize the effect of LCZ696 treatment of patients suffering from hypertension and heart failure (HF) and further highlight the role of this new drug as a treatment option in the future.

The numbers of adverse effects were comparable. LCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing mortality, hospitalizations and HF symptoms. Adverse effects were reduced with a slower up-titrating regimen of 6 weeks. The current results are promising and suggest that LCZ696 will be a new candidate for first-line treatment of HF.

Meanwhile, the current application of generic treatment approaches to patients with vastly differing biological and clinical profiles is far from optimal. Here, we conduct a meta-review to identify predictors of response to antidepressant therapy in order to select robust input features for machine learning models of treatment response. These machine learning models will allow us to learn associations between patient features and treatment response which have predictive value at the individual patient level; this learning can be optimized by selecting high-quality input features for the model. While current research is difficult to directly apply to the clinic, machine learning models built using knowledge gleaned from current research may become useful clinical tools. The EMBASE and MEDLINE/PubMed online databases were searched from January 1996 to August 2017, using a combination of MeSH terms and keywords to identify relevant literature reviews. We identified a total of 1909 articles, wherein 199 articles met our inclusion criteria. An array of genetic, immune, endocrine, neuroimaging, sociodemographic, and symptom-based predictors of treatment response were extracted, varying widely in clinical utility. Due to heterogeneous sample sizes, effect sizes, publication biases, and methodological disparities across reviews, we could not accurately assess the strength and directionality of every predictor. Notwithstanding our cautious interpretation of the results, we have identified a multitude of predictors that can be used to formulate a priori hypotheses regarding the input features for a computational model.

It was hypothesized that EEG-based SL features could discriminate MDD patients and healthy controls with an acceptable accuracy better than measures such as interhemispheric coherence and mutual information. In this work, classification models such as support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and Na\u00efve Bayesian (NB) were employed to model relationship between the EEG features and the study groups (MDD patient and healthy controls) and ultimately achieved discrimination of study participants.

We also included data from a small yet completely independent cohort RIS-INT-93 as an external test dataset. We used features from enrollment and level 1 treatment (up to week 2 response only) of STAR*D to explore the feature space comprehensively and applied machine learning methods to model TRD outcome at level 2. For TRD defined using QIDS-C16 remission criteria, multiple machine learning models were internally cross-validated in the STAR*D training dataset and externally validated in both the STAR*D testing dataset and RIS-INT-93 independent dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70-0.78 and 0.72-0.77, respectively. The upper bound for the AUC achievable with the full set of features could be as high as 0.78 in the STAR*D testing dataset.

We report results of model validation in an independent prospective national household sample of 1056 respondents with lifetime MDD at baseline. The WMH ML models were applied to these baseline data to generate predicted outcome scores that were compared with observed scores assessed 10-12 years after baseline. ML model prediction accuracy was also compared with that of conventional logistic regression models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve based on ML (0.63 for high chronicity and 0.71-0.76 for the other prospective outcomes) was consistently higher than for the logistic models (0.62-0.70) despite the latter models including more predictors. A total of 34.6-38.1% of respondents with subsequent high persistence chronicity and 40.8-55.8% with the severity indicators were in the top 20% of the baseline ML-predicted risk distribution, while only 0.9% of respondents with subsequent hospitalizations and 1.5% with suicide attempts were in the lowest 20% of the ML-predicted risk distribution.

However, these structural differences appear subtle in comparison with conventional radiologically defined abnormalities, with considerable inter-subject variability. Consequently, it has not been possible to readily identify scans from patients with major depressive disorder at an individual level. Recently, machine learning techniques such as relevance vector machines and support vector machines have been applied to predictive classification of individual scans with variable success. Here we describe a novel hybrid method, which combines machine learning with feature selection and characterization, with the latter aimed at maximizing the accuracy of machine learning prediction. The method was tested using a multi-centre dataset of T(1)-weighted 'structural' scans. A total of 62 patients with major depressive disorder and matched controls were recruited from referred secondary care clinical populations in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, UK. The generalization ability and predictive accuracy of the classifiers was tested using data left out of the training process. High prediction accuracy was achieved (~90%). While feature selection was important for maximizing high predictive accuracy with machine learning, feature characterization contributed only a modest improvement to relevance vector machine-based prediction (~5%). Notably, while the only information provided for training the classifiers was T(1)-weighted scans plus a categorical label (major depressive disorder versus controls), both relevance vector machine and support vector machine 'weighting factors' (used for making predictions) correlated strongly with subjective ratings of illness severity. These results indicate that machine learning techniques have the potential to inform clinical practice and research, as they can make accurate predictions about brain scan data from individual subjects. Furthermore, machine learning weighting factors may reflect an objective biomarker of major depressive disorder illness severity, based on abnormalities of brain structure.",

Predicted values were strongly correlated across outcomes. Cluster analysis of predicted values found three clusters with consistently high, intermediate or low values. The high-risk cluster (32.4% of cases) accounted for 56.6-72.9% of high persistence, high chronicity, hospitalization and disability. This high-risk cluster had both higher sensitivity and likelihood ratio positive (LR+; relative proportions of cases in the high-risk cluster versus other clusters having the adverse outcomes) than in a parallel analysis that excluded measures of co-morbidity as predictors. Although the results using the retrospective data reported here suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made with machine learning and clustering across multiple indicators of illness persistence/severity, replication with prospective data is needed to confirm this preliminary conclusion.",

As symptom severity may influence brain activity, we investigated whether the severity of MDD affected the accuracies of machine learned MDD-vs-Control diagnostic classifiers. Forty-five medication-free patients with DSM-IV defined MDD and 19 healthy controls participated in the study. Based on depression severity as determined by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), MDD patients were sorted into three groups: mild to moderate depression (HRSD 14-19), severe depression (HRSD 20-23), and very severe depression (HRSD \u2265 24). We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during both resting-state and an emotional-face matching task. Patients in each of the three severity groups were compared against controls in separate analyses, using either the resting-state or task-based fMRI data. We use each of these six datasets with linear support vector machine (SVM) binary classifiers for identifying individuals as patients or controls. The resting-state fMRI data showed statistically significant classification accuracy only for the very severe depression group (accuracy 66%, p = 0.012 corrected), while mild to moderate (accuracy 58%, p = 1.0 corrected) and severe depression (accuracy 52%, p = 1.0 corrected) were only at chance. With task-based fMRI data, the automated classifier performed at chance in all three severity groups. Binary linear SVM classifiers achieved significant classification of very severe depression with resting-state fMRI, but the contribution of brain measurements may have limited potential in differentiating patients with less severe depression from healthy controls.",

MEG data was acquired from 22 MDD patients and 22 healthy controls (HC) resting awake with eyes closed. Individual power spectra were calculated by a Fourier transform. Sources were reconstructed via beamforming technique. Bayesian linear regression was applied to predict depression severity based on the spatial distribution of oscillatory power. In MDD patients, decreased theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) power was observed in fronto-central and posterior areas respectively, whereas increased beta (14-30 Hz) power was observed in fronto-central regions. In particular, posterior alpha power was negatively related to depression severity. The Bayesian linear regression model showed significant depression severity prediction performance based on the spatial distribution of both alpha (r=0.68, p=0.0005) and beta power (r=0.56, p=0.007) respectively. Our findings point to a specific alteration of oscillatory brain activity in MDD patients during rest as characterized from MEG data in terms of spectral and spatial distribution. The proposed model yielded a quantitative and objective estimation for the depression severity, which in turn has a potential for diagnosis and monitoring of the recovery process.",

This present study examined the associations among chronic apical periodontitis (CAP), root canal endotoxin levels (lipopolysaccharides, LPS), O&amp;NS pathways, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Measurements included advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid peroxides (LOOH), -sulfhydryl (SH) groups, total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in participants with CAP, with and without depression, as well as healthy controls (no depression, no CAP). Root canal LPS levels were positively associated with CAP, clinical depression, severity of depression (as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory) and O&amp;NS biomarkers, especially NOx and TRAP. CAP-related depression was accompanied by increased levels of NOx, LOOH, AOPP, and TRAP. In CAP participants, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.734, p &lt; 0.001) between root canal LPS and the HDRS score. There were significant and positive associations between CAP or root canal endotoxin with the vegetative and physio-somatic symptoms of the HDRS as well as a significant inverse association between root canal endotoxin and quality of life with strong effects on psychological, environmental, and social domains. It is concluded that increased root canal LPS accompanying CAP may cause depression and a lowered quality of life, which may be partly explained by activated O&amp;NS pathways, especially NOx thereby enhancing hypernitrosylation and thus neuroprogressive processes. Dental health and \"leaky teeth\" may be intimately linked to the etiology and course of depression, while significantly impacting quality of life.",

However, few studies focusing on detection of the signatures of bacteria in feces of MDD patients using proteomics approach have been carried out. Here, a comparative metaproteomics analysis on the basis of an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was carried out to explore the signature of gut microbiota in patients with MDD. Ten patients (age: 18-56 years, five women) who had MDD and a score over 20 on the Hamilton's Depression Scale and 10 healthy controls (age: 24-65 years, five women) group matched for sex, age, and BMI were enrolled. As a result, 279 significantly differentiated bacterial proteins (P&lt;0.05) were detected and used for further bioinformatic analysis. According to phylogenetic analysis, statistically significant differences were observed for four phyla: Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria (P&lt;0.05, for each). Abundances of 16 bacterial families were significantly different between the MDD and healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, Cluster of Orthologous Groups analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that disordered metabolic pathways of bacterial proteins were mainly involved in glucose metabolism and amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, fecal microbiota signatures were altered significantly in MDD patients. Our findings provide a novel insight into the potential connection between gut microbiota and depression.",

Despite promising preclinical data, early clinical trials in multiple diseases showed only modest efficacy. In 1996, the relatively frequent occurrence of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (<i>FLT3</i>) activating mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was first recognized. Several years later, midostaurin was discovered to be a potent inhibitor of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase and to have activity against mutant forms of KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, which drive advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM). Through a series of collaborations between industry and academia, midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy was evaluated in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 10603/RATIFY study, a large, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with newly diagnosed <i>FLT3</i>-mutated AML. This was the first study to show significant improvements in overall survival and event-free survival with the addition of a targeted therapy to standard chemotherapy in this population. Around the same time, durable responses were also observed in other trials of midostaurin in patients with advanced SM. Collectively, these clinical data led to the approval of midostaurin by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for both newly diagnosed <i>FLT3</i>-mutated AML and advanced SM.",

Here, we describe a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5 promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that GRG5 has pleiotropic roles in stem cell biology functioning as a stemness factor and a neural fate specifier.",

Although ivacaftor (VX-770) alone and ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor (VX-809) improve lung function in CF patients with the Gly551Asp and del508Phe mutations, respectively, the effects of these drugs on the function of human CF macrophages are unknown. Thus studies were conducted to examine the effects of lumacaftor alone and lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor (i.e., ORKAMBI) on the ability of human CF ( del508Phe/ del508Phe) monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to phagocytose and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lumacaftor alone restored the ability of CF MDMs to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa to levels observed in MDMs obtained from non-CF (WT-CFTR) donors. This effect contrasts with the partial (~15%) correction of del508Phe Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion of airway epithelial cells by lumacaftor. Ivacaftor reduced the ability of lumacaftor to stimulate phagocytosis and killing of P. aeruginosa. Lumacaftor had no effect on P. aeruginosa-stimulated cytokine secretion by CF MDMs. Ivacaftor (5 \u00b5M) alone and ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor reduced secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines.

CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. To date, more than 2,000 CFTR mutations have been identified, which produce a wide range of phenotypes. The CFTR protein, a chloride channel, is normally expressed on epithelial cells lining the lung, gut, and exocrine glands. Mutations in CFTR have led to pleiotropic effects in CF patients and have resulted in early morbidity and mortality. Research has focused on identifying small molecules, or modulators, that can restore CFTR function. In recent years, two modulators, ivacaftor (Kalydeco) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi), have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat CF patients with certain CFTR mutations. The development of these modulators has served as proof-of-concept that targeting CFTR by modulators is a viable therapeutic option. Efforts to discover new modulators that could deliver a wider and greater clinical benefit are still ongoing. However, traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) require large numbers of patients and become impracticable to test the modulators' efficacy in CF patients with CFTR mutations at frequencies much lower than 1%, suggesting the need for personalized medicine in these CF patients.",

Recently, ORKAMBI, a combination therapy that includes a corrector of the processing defect of F508del-CFTR (lumacaftor or VX-809) and a potentiator of channel activity (ivacaftor or VX-770), was approved for CF patients homozygous for this mutation. However, clinical studies revealed that the effect of ORKAMBI on lung function is modest and it was proposed that this modest effect relates to a negative impact of VX-770 on the stability of F508del-CFTR. In the current studies, we showed that this negative effect of VX-770 at 10 <i>\u03bc</i>M correlated with its inhibitory effect on VX-809-mediated correction of the interface between the second membrane spanning domain and the first nucleotide binding domain bearing F508del. Interestingly, we found that VX-770 exerted a similar negative effect on the stability of other membrane localized solute carriers (SLC26A3, SLC26A9, and SLC6A14), suggesting that this negative effect is not specific for F508del-CFTR. We determined that the relative destabilizing effect of a panel of VX-770 derivatives on F508del-CFTR correlated with their predicted lipophilicity. Polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy on a supported lipid bilayer model shows that VX-770, and not its less lipophilic derivative, increased the fluidity of and reorganized the membrane. In summary, our findings show that there is a potential for nonspecific effects of VX-770 on the lipid bilayer and suggest that this effect may account for its destabilizing effect on VX-809- rescued F508del-CFTR.",
