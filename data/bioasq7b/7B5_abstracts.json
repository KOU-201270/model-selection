TFs activated by extracellular stimuli operate within this predetermined repertoire, landing close to where master regulators are constitutively bound. Here, we describe latent enhancers, defined as regions of the genome that in terminally differentiated cells are unbound by TFs and lack the histone marks characteristic of enhancers but acquire these features in response to stimulation. Macrophage stimulation caused sequential binding of stimulus-activated and lineage-determining TFs to these regions, enabling deposition of enhancer marks. Once unveiled, many of these enhancers did not return to a latent state when stimulation ceased; instead, they persisted and mediated a faster and stronger response upon restimulation. We suggest that stimulus-specific expansion of the cis-regulatory repertoire provides an epigenomic memory of the exposure to environmental agents.",

Recent clinical and genetic studies display an association between apoE genotype (APOE) and the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis, raising the possibility that modulation of apoE may be a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability. Histopathological analysis showed that COG112 and COG133 attenuated demyelination and significantly diminished the number of peripheral cells infiltrating into the spinal cord. ApoE mimetics also interfered with several mechanisms relevant to the pathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis, including activation of macrophages, subsequent production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines, and lymphocyte proliferation. These data suggest that apoE mimetics represent a multidimensional therapeutic for multiple sclerosis capable of inhibiting the inflammatory cascade, modulating immune cell function, and reducing clinical signs, which may have novel utility for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases.",

Overall the majority of rearrangements were interchromosomal, so arising from unequal meiotic exchange, and there were approximately equal numbers of maternal and paternal deletions. Duplications and deletions of 15q11-q13 appear to be reciprocal products that arise by the same mechanisms. The proportion arising from interchromosomal exchanges varied among deletions with 22q11 the highest and 15q11-q13 the lowest. However, parental and chromosomal origins were not always independent. For 15q11-q13, maternal deletions tended to be interchromosomal while paternal deletions tended to be intrachromosomal; for 22q11 there was a possible excess of maternal cases among intrachromosomal deletions.

The inheritance of the syndrome (10%) is autosomal dominant. Most people with 22q11.2DS are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell. A small percentage of affected individuals have shorter deletions in the same region (contiguous gene deletion syndrome).

Accumulating evidence demonstrates the involvement of asporin in OA pathogenesis. Many human studies have been conducted to explore the association between the D-repeat polymorphisms and OA susceptibility, but these yield inconsistent results. Possible mechanisms for the involvement of asporin in OA pathology include its influence on TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2) signaling pathways and collagen mineralization. To date, no studies were found to use an asporin-deficient animal model that would help to understand disease mechanisms. Many issues must be addressed to clarify the link between asporin and OA to provide a novel therapeutic strategy for OA, perhaps through controlling and modifying the TGF-\u03b2-ECM system. Studies examined demonstrate the involvement of asporin in OA pathogenesis, and possible mechanisms by which asporin may be involved in this process have been proposed.

In line with other studies, we have confirmed asporin expression by RNA scope in situ hybridization in cancer associated fibroblasts. We have also found asporin expression in the Hs578T breast cancer cell line which we confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting.

Through knockdown of asporin in CRC cell lines RKO and SW620 or overexpression of asporin in cell lines HT-29 and LoVo, we found that asporin could enhance wound healing, migration and invasion abilities of the CRC cells. Further more, with the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) tube formation assays and the xenograft model, we found that asporin promoted the tumor growth through stimulating the VEGF signaling pathway. The portal vein injection models suggested that asporin overexpression stimulated the liver metastasis of HT29 cell line, while asporin knockdown inhibited the liver metastasis of RKO cell line.

We have used Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multivariate analysis to correlate the expression of Asporin (ASPN) mRNA and protein with prostate cancer progression in independent cohorts. We used immunohistochemistry and H scoring to document stromal localisation of ASPN in a tissue microarray and mouse prostate cancer model, and correlated expression with reactive stroma, defined using Masson Trichrome staining. We used cell cultures of primary prostate cancer fibroblasts treated with serum-free conditioned media from prostate cancer cell lines to examine regulation of ASPN mRNA in tumour stromal cells. We observed increased expression of ASPN mRNA in a data set derived from benign vs tumour microdissected tissue, and a correlation with biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis. ASPN protein localised to tumour stroma and elevated expression of ASPN was correlated with decreased time to biochemical recurrence, in a cohort of 326 patients with a median follow up of 9.6 years. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that ASPN was correlated with progression, as were Gleason score, and clinical stage. Additionally, ASPN expression correlated with the presence of reactive stroma, suggesting that it may be a stromal marker expressed in response to the presence of tumour cells and particularly with aggressive tumour subtypes. We observed expression of ASPN in the stroma of tumours induced by p53 inhibition in a mouse model of prostate cancer, and correlation with neuroendocrine marker expression. Finally, we demonstrated that ASPN transcript expression in normal and cancer fibroblasts was regulated by conditioned media derived from the PC3, but not LNCaP, prostate cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that ASPN is a stromally expressed biomarker that correlates with disease progression, and is observed in reactive stroma. ASPN expression in stroma may be part of a stromal response to aggressive tumour subtypes.",

In this review, we discuss new insights into how the structural features of the 3D genome hierarchy are established and maintained, how this hierarchy undergoes dynamic rearrangement during normal development and how its perturbation will lead to human disease, highlighting the accumulating evidence that links the diverse 3D genome architecture components to a multitude of human diseases and the emerging mechanisms by which 3D genome derangement causes disease phenotypes.",

TADs are demarcated by boundary regions bound by architectural proteins, such as CTCF and cohesin, although much remains to be discovered about the structure and function of these domains. Recent studies of TAD boundaries disrupted in engineered mouse models show that boundary mutations can recapitulate human developmental disorders as a result of aberrant promoter-enhancer interactions in the affected TADs. Similar boundary disruptions in certain cancers can result in oncogene overexpression, and CTCF binding sites at boundaries appear to be hyper-mutated across cancers. Further insights into chromatin organisation, in parallel with accumulating whole genome sequence data for disease cohorts, are likely to yield additional valuable insights into the roles of noncoding sequence variation in human disease.",

Disruption of TAD boundaries results in aberrant gene expression by exposing genes to inappropriate regulatory elements. Recent studies have shown that TAD disruption is often found in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis through two mechanisms. One mechanism locally disrupts domains by deleting or mutating a TAD boundary leading to fusion of the two adjacent TADs. The other mechanism involves genomic rearrangements that break up TADs and creates new ones without directly affecting TAD boundaries. Understanding the mechanisms by which TADs form and control long-range chromatin interactions will therefore not only provide insights into the mechanism of gene regulation in general, but will also reveal how genomic rearrangements and mutations in cancer genomes can lead to misregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors.",

Chromosomes fold locally into topologically associating domains (TADs) defined by increased intra-domain chromatin contacts. TADs contribute to gene regulation by restricting chromatin interactions of regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, with their target genes. Disruption of TADs can result in altered gene expression and is associated to genetic diseases and cancers. However, it is not clear to which extent TAD regions are conserved in evolution and whether disruption of TADs by evolutionary rearrangements can alter gene expression. Here, we hypothesize that TADs represent essential functional units of genomes, which are stable against rearrangements during evolution. We investigate this using whole-genome alignments to identify evolutionary rearrangement breakpoints of different vertebrate species. Rearrangement breakpoints are strongly enriched at TAD boundaries and depleted within TADs across species. Furthermore, using gene expression data across many tissues in mouse and human, we show that genes within TADs have more conserved expression patterns. Disruption of TADs by evolutionary rearrangements is associated with changes in gene expression profiles, consistent with a functional role of TADs in gene expression regulation. Together, these results indicate that TADs are conserved building blocks of genomes with regulatory functions that are often reshuffled as a whole instead of being disrupted by rearrangements.",

We describe here the case of a fetus with a severe multiple congenital anomalies syndrome, including extensive polydactyly of the four limbs. This fetus carries a de novo deletion next to the IHH gene, encompassing a TAD boundary. Such an IHH TAD boundary deletion has already been described in the Dbf mouse model, which shows a quite similar, but less severe phenotype. We hypothesize that the deletion harbored by this fetus results in the same pathophysiological mechanisms as those of the Dbf model.

Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we generated mice with corresponding rearrangements. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus.

A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx.

In this work, H7 cells were orthotopically implanted in C57BL/6 mice and treated with L-4F. Then, pancreatic cancer progression and the inflammatory microenvironment were investigated <i>in vivo</i>. The cytotoxicity of L-4F toward H7 cells was assessed <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of L-4F on macrophage polarization by analyzing the polarization and genes of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages <i>in vitro</i>. The results show that L-4F substantially reduced the tumorigenicity of H7 cells. L-4F inhibited inflammation by reducing the accumulation of inflammatory cells, such as IL-17A-, IL-4-, GM-CSF-, IL-1\u03b2-, and IL-6-producing cells and Th1 and Th17. Notably, L-4F also decreased the percentage of macrophages in tumor tissues, especially M2 macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup>), which was also confirmed <i>in vitro</i>. Additionally, the expression of the M2 marker genes <i>Arg1</i>, <i>MRC1</i>, and <i>CCL22</i> and the inflammatory genes <i>IL-6</i>, <i>iNOS</i>, and <i>IL-12</i> was decreased by L-4F, indicating that L-4F prevents M2 type macrophage polarization.

To follow the progeny of lactotransferrin-expressing bone marrow cells, we generated a mouse model in which a reporter gene is irreversibly activated from the lactotransferrin-promoter. We found that lactotransferrin-reporter labels a majority of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and distinct subtypes of dendritic cells, while excluding T, B, natural killer cells, interferon-producing killer dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, erythrocytes and eosinophils. Lactotransferrin-reporter(-) bone marrow cells retain lymphoid, erythroid and long-term repopulating potential, while lactotransferrin-reporter(+) bone marrow cells confer only myeloid, but not lymphoid potential.

Oleuropein is the only OLE component that has shown anti-inflammatory effects at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL. Furthermore, OLE exhibited antibacterial activity against some gram positive bacterial strains; however, gram negative bacterial strains were resistant to OLE. Downregulation of TNF\u03b1 secretion in PMNCs culture in response to OLE treatment indicates that this polyphenol-rich extract has an anti-inflammatory effect, and oleuropein is the major OLE component responsible for this effect.

Areas covered: Current literature on reslizumab has been reviewed with a specific focus on its safety profile in the treatment of severe asthma. Expert opinion: Large pivotal and supportive trials reinforce the view that reslizumab is well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile in patients exposed for longer than 2 years. However, no or few data concerning safety in special populations such as smokers, those with immune- and cellular senescence, patients with comorbidities and those receiving multi-drug treatments are available as yet. Furthermore, we need to fully elucidate some fundamental issues such as the risk of anaphylaxis and the long-term risk-benefit ratio of the impact of depletion of eosinophils and the potential risk of malignancies induced by a treatment with this anti-IL-5 agent.",

Eosinophil differentiation, maturation, migration, and survival are primarily under the control of interleukin-5 (IL-5). Reslizumab is a humanized monoclonal (immunoglobulin G4/\u03ba) antibody that binds with high affinity to circulating human IL-5 and downregulates the IL-5 signaling pathway, potentially disrupting the maturation and survival of eosinophils. In 2016, an intravenous formulation of reslizumab was approved in the USA, Canada, and Europe as add-on maintenance treatment for patients aged \u2a7e18 years with severe asthma and with an eosinophilic phenotype. The efficacy of reslizumab as add-on intravenous therapy has been reported in several phase III studies in patients with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophil counts (\u2a7e400 cells/\u00b5l). Compared with placebo, reslizumab was associated with significant improvements in clinical exacerbation rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, asthma symptoms and quality of life, and significant reductions in blood eosinophil counts. Reslizumab also demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile similar to that of placebo, with reported adverse events being mostly mild to moderate in severity. Ongoing studies are focusing on the evaluation of a subcutaneous formulation of reslizumab in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.

In three double-blind BREATH studies of up to 52 weeks' duration, adding intravenous reslizumab (3 mg/kg, once every 4 weeks) to the current asthma therapy of patients (aged 12-75 years) with eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids resulted in significant reductions in clinical asthma exacerbation frequency and significant improvements in lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life relative to adding placebo. Pooled data from the two trials of 52 weeks' duration indicated similar benefits with reslizumab across various patient subgroups, including patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Reslizumab was generally well tolerated, with very few recipients experiencing severe or serious treatment-related adverse events. Moreover, in an open-label extension study, continued use of reslizumab for up to 2 years was associated with durable lung function benefit, without any new tolerability concerns.

Studies of the pathophysiology of eosinophils revealed that they produce many bioactive compounds that contribute to the pathophysiology of a number of diseases including asthma. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) in particular is an important factor in some forms of severe asthma. A rat antibody to IL-5 (39D10) was humanized producing the product now know as reslizumab.

It was only when the importance of the eosinophilic asthma endotype was recognized that reslizumab was found to indeed reduce the severity and exacerbations of asthma in patients who were inadequately treated by inhaled and/ or oral corticosteroids. These studies have determined that reslizumab is a valuable drug for the management of such patients provided that they have an eosinophil count of &gt; 400 cells/mcL.

We describe a crystal structure of p300 in which the autoinhibitory loop invades the active site of a neighbouring HAT domain, revealing a snapshot of a trans-autoacetylation reaction intermediate.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of miR-150, a potential p300-targeting microRNA (miRNA), in the post-transcriptional control of p300 expression and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by high glucose. We observed that the expression of miR-150 was significantly reduced, whereas the expression of p300 was strongly elevated, concomitant with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in the hearts of diabetic rats compared with normal controls. Similar alterations were observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes that had been exposed to high levels of glucose. miR-150 mimics inhibited p300 3'-UTR luciferase reporter activity, as well as endogenous p300 expression. In addition, miR-150 mimics prevented glucose-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Co-transfection with a p300 expression vector and miR-150 mimics reversed the protective effect of miR-150 on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We further showed that the high glucose-mediated activation of PKC\u03b2(2) in turn mediated the down-regulation of miR-150 expression.

This study aimed to evaluate its gastroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. Besides, continuously increasing interest in assessing the role of the plant active constituents preventing the risk of cancer was a reason to make a detailed examination of the investigated ethanol, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and N-butanol extracts regarding cytotoxicity. Oral administration of the investigated extracts caused a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in a model of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. Gastroprotective activity of the extracts was investigated using an ethanol-induced acute stress ulcer in rats. The cytotoxic activity of plant extracts was assessed on PBMC, B16, and HL-60 cells and compared to the cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds identified in extracts. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death were analyzed by double staining with fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V and PI. The developed HPLC method enabled qualitative fingerprint analysis of phenolic compounds in the investigated extracts. Compared to the effect of the positive control, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacine (4 mg/kg), which produced a 50 % decrease in inflammation, diethyl ether and N-butanol extracts exhibited about the same effect in doses of 200 and 100 mg/kg (53.6 and 48.7 %; 48.4 and 49.9 %, respectively). All investigated extracts produced dose-dependent gastroprotective activity with the efficacy comparable to that of the reference drug ranitidine. The diethyl ether extract showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity on B16 cells and HL-60 cells, decreasing cell growth to 51.3 % and 77.5 % of control, respectively, when used at 100 \u00b5g/mL. It seems that phenolic compounds (apigenin, luteolin, and their corresponding glycosides) are responsible for the diethyl ether extract cytotoxic effect. It also appears that induction of oxidative stress might be involved in its cytotoxicity, since B16 and HL-60 cells increased their ROS production in response to treatment with diethyl ether extract. Neither of the tested extracts nor any phenolic compounds showed significant cytotoxic effect to human PBMC.

Compounds were detected both after inducing skin gland secretions and in constitutive mucosal rinses from toads. We described the antimicrobial properties of each bufadienolide against Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an amphibian fungal pathogen linked with boreal toad population declines. All three bufadienolides were found to inhibit Bd growth at similar levels. The maximum Bd inhibition produced by arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin were approximately 50%, in contrast to the complete Bd inhibition shown by antimicrobial skin peptides produced by some amphibian species. In addition, skin mucus samples significantly reduced Bd viability, and bufadienolides were detected in 15 of 62 samples. Bufadienolides also appeared to enhance growth of the anti-Bd bacterium Janthinobacterium lividum, and thus may be involved in regulation of the skin microbiome. Here, we localized skin bacteria within the mucus layer and granular glands of toads with fluorescent in situ hybridization. Overall, our results suggest that bufadienolides can function in antifungal defense on amphibian skin and their production is a potentially convergent trait similar to antimicrobial peptide defenses found on the skin of other species.

Adipocytokines are significantly regulated by nutritional status and can directly influence other organ systems, including brain, liver and skeletal muscle. Adiponectin plays a key role as an anti-inflammatory hormone. Upregulated expression of resistin, vaspin, apelin and TNF-\u03b1 plays a significant role in induction of insulin resistance linked with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Ghrelin, the circulating peptide, has been found to stimulate appetite and regulate energy balance. Thus, it can be considered 1 of the candidate genes for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Omentin is a novel adipokine produced by visceral adipose tissue. Circulating levels of omentin are decreased in insulin-resistant states, for example, in obesity and diabetes. IL-6 plays a vital role in regulating the accumulation of lipids intramyocardially. Based on the biologic relevance of these adipocytokines, they can no longer be considered as energy storage sites alone but must also be considered in metabolic control. Hence, the present review summarizes the regulatory roles of adipocytokines in diabetes linked with obesity.",

Although apelin has been studied in persons with different conditions, no studies have yet examined the joint influence of obesity and diabetes on apelin levels. We measured the changes in apelin levels in morbidly obese subjects, with and without diabetes, and in the inverse situation of improvement in carbohydrate metabolism as a result of bariatric surgery. The study was undertaken in 54 morbidly obese persons, 16 of whom had type 2 diabetes mellitus, before and 7 months after undergoing bariatric surgery, and in 12 healthy, nonobese persons. Measurements were made of apelin levels and insulin sensitivity by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The apelin levels in the morbidly obese patients prior to surgery were significantly higher than those of the controls only when the morbidly obese subjects were diabetic (P &lt; 0.005). Apelin levels correlated significantly in the morbidly obese patients with serum triglycerides (r = 0.292, P = 0.032) and glucose (r = 0.337, P = 0.039). Bariatric surgery resulted in a significant decrease in apelin levels only in the morbidly obese subjects with impaired fasting glucose or diabetes. The change in apelin levels correlated significantly in the morbidly obese patients with the changes in serum glucose (r = 0.338, P = 0.038) and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.417, P = 0.043). This study demonstrates that obesity is not the main determinant of the rise in apelin levels. The association between apelin levels and glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity provides evidence that apelin may play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes.",

Diabetes was diagnosed by an oral glucose tolerance test, plasma hemoglobin A1c, and if the subject was taking medications for diabetes. Plasma apelin-12 at baseline was measured with a commercial kit. Plasma apelin concentrations were higher in women than in men at baseline (p=0.007). During follow-up, 43 subjects developed type 2 diabetes. Higher plasma apelin concentrations were associated with a higher risk of diabetes in men (p=0.049) but not in women.

Apelin could improve the prediction ability beyond traditional risk factors in men, and the sensitivity and specificity of plasma apelin at 0.9ng/ml for this prediction were 63.2% and 58.9%, respectively. In men at risk for diabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%, FPG 100-125mg/dl, or OGTT-2h-PG 140-199mg/dl), the risk for developing diabetes was higher in those with higher plasma apelin concentration than in those with lower plasma apelin concentrations (10.6%/year vs. 5.1%/year, p&lt;0.001).

Mitosomes are the simplest and the least well-studied type of anaerobic mitochondria. Transport of proteins via TIM complexes, composed of three proteins of the Tim17 protein family (Tim17/22/23), is one of the key unifying aspects of mitochondria and mitochondria-derived organelles. However, multiple experimental and bioinformatic attempts have so far failed to identify the nature of TIM in mitosomes of the anaerobic metamonad protist, Giardia intestinalis, one of the few experimental models for mitosome biology. Here, we present the identification of a single G. intestinalis Tim17 protein (GiTim17), made possible only by the implementation of a metamonad-specific hidden Markov model. While very divergent in primary sequence and in predicted membrane topology, experimental data suggest that GiTim17 is an inner membrane mitosomal protein, forming a disulphide-linked dimer. We suggest that the peculiar GiTim17 sequence reflects adaptation to the unusual, detergent resistant, inner mitosomal membrane. Specific pull-down experiments indicate interaction of GiTim17 with mitosomal Tim44, the tethering component of the import motor complex. Analysis of TIM complexes across eukaryote diversity suggests that a \"single Tim\" translocase is a convergent adaptation of mitosomes in anaerobic protists, with Tim22 and Tim17 (but not Tim23), providing the protein backbone.",

Here, we investigated the dynamics of the mitosomes, the simplest forms of mitochondria, in the anaerobic protist parasite Giardia intestinalis, a member of the Excavata supergroup of eukaryotes. The mitosomes have abandoned typical mitochondrial traits such as the mitochondrial genome and aerobic respiration and their single role known to date is the formation of iron-sulfur clusters. In live experiments, no fusion events were observed between the mitosomes in G. intestinalis. Moreover, the organelles were highly prone to becoming heterogeneous. This suggests that fusion is either much less frequent or even absent in mitosome dynamics. Unlike in mitochondria, division of the mitosomes was absolutely synchronized and limited to mitosis. The association of the nuclear and the mitosomal division persisted during the encystation of the parasite. During the segregation of the divided mitosomes, the subset of the organelles between two G. intestinalis nuclei had a prominent role. Surprisingly, the sole dynamin-related protein of the parasite seemed not to be involved in mitosomal division. However, throughout the cell cycle, mitosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although none of the known ER-tethering complexes was present. Instead, the ER-mitosome interface was occupied by the lipid metabolism enzyme long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4. This study provides the first report on the dynamics of mitosomes. We show that together with the loss of metabolic complexity of mitochondria, mitosomes of G. intestinalis have uniquely streamlined their dynamics by harmonizing their division with mitosis. We propose that this might be a strategy of G. intestinalis to maintain a stable number of organelles during cell propagation. The lack of mitosomal fusion may also be related to the secondary reduction of the organelles. However, as there are currently no reports on mitochondrial fusion in the whole Excavata supergroup, it is possible that the absence of mitochondrial fusion is an ancestral trait common to all excavates.",

PNT was previously postulated to be localized to the highly divergent mitochondrion-related organelle, the mitosome, in the anaerobic/microaerophilic protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica based on the potential mitochondrion-targeting signal. However, our previous proteomic study of isolated phagosomes suggested that PNT is localized to organelles other than mitosomes. An immunofluorescence assay using anti-E. histolytica PNT (EhPNT) antibody raised against the NADH-binding domain showed a distribution to the membrane of numerous vesicles/vacuoles, including lysosomes and phagosomes. The domain(s) required for the trafficking of PNT to vesicles/vacuoles was examined by using amoeba transformants expressing a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated PNTs fused with green fluorescent protein or a hemagglutinin tag. All truncated PNTs failed to reach vesicles/vacuoles and were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data indicate that the putative targeting signal is not sufficient for the trafficking of PNT to the vesicular/vacuolar compartments and that full-length PNT is necessary for correct transport. PNT displayed a smear of &gt;120 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. PNGase F and tunicamycin treatment, chemical degradation of carbohydrates, and heat treatment of PNT suggested that the apparent aberrant mobility of PNT is likely attributable to its hydrophobic nature. PNT that is compartmentalized to the acidic compartments is unprecedented in eukaryotes and may possess a unique physiological role in E. histolytica.",

Focused on contributing to the development of new therapeutic alternatives for NDs, in this study, for the first time, a screening of 57 natural products for in vitro inhibition of Leishmania major DHODH (LmDHODH) was carried out, including cross validation against the human DHODH (HsDHODH). A subset of natural products consisting of 21 sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) was submitted to QSAR studies. Additionally, thermostability studies by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) were performed to determine whether the STLs are effectively or not binding to the enzyme. The IC<sub>50</sub> values against LmDHODH varied from 27 to 1200 \u03bcM; only irrelevant inhibition was obtained on HsDHODH. DSF assays confirmed binding of STLs to LmDHODH; moreover, it is suggested that such inhibitors might act in a different site other than the active site. A reliable QSAR model based on molecular descriptors was obtained (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.83; Q<sup>2</sup><sub>CV</sub>: 0.69 and Q<sup>2</sup><sub>EXT/F2</sub>: 0.66) indicating that stronger inhibition requires a balanced distribution of the hydrophobic regions across the molecular surface, as well as higher width and lower hydrophobicity of the molecules.

However, previous attempts to generate uracil auxotrophy by genetically deleting the mitochondrion-associated DHODH of T. gondii (TgDHODH) failed. To further address the essentiality of TgDHODH, mutant gene alleles deficient in TgDHODH activity were designed to ablate the enzyme activity. Replacement of the endogenous DHODH gene with catalytically deficient DHODH gene alleles induced uracil auxotrophy. Catalytically deficient TgDHODH localized to the mitochondria, and parasites retained mitochondrial membrane potential.

The order of effectiveness as inhibitors on pyrimidine ring cleavage reaction for dihydroorotase was 5-fluoro orotate greater than 5-amino orotate, 5-methyl orotate greater than orotate greater than 5-bromo orotate greater than 5-iodo orotate with Ki values of 65, 142, 166, 860, 2200 and greater than 3500 microM, respectively. 5-Fluoro orotate and orotate were the most effective inhibitors for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. In vitro, 5-fluoro orotate and 5-amino orotate caused 50% inhibition of the growth of P. falciparum at concentrations of 10 nM and 1 microM, respectively. In mice infected with P. berghei, these two orotate analogs at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight eliminated parasitemia after a 4-day treatment, an effect comparable to that of the same dose of chloroquine. The infected mice treated with 5-fluoro orotate at a lower dose of 2.5 mg/kg had a 95% reduction in parasitemia. The effects of the more potent compounds tested in combination with inhibitors of other enzymes of this pathway on P. falciparum in vitro and P. berghei in vivo are currently under investigation. These results suggest that the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in the malarial parasite may be a target for the design of antimalarial drugs.",

The malaria parasite is unable to salvage pyrimidines and relies on de novo biosynthesis for survival. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), a mitochondrially localized flavoenzyme, catalyzes the rate-limiting step of this pathway and is therefore an attractive antimalarial chemotherapeutic target. Using a target-based high throughput screen, we have identified a series of potent, species-specific inhibitors of P. falciparum DHOD (pfDHOD) that are also efficacious against three cultured strains (3D7, HB3, and Dd2) of P. falciparum. The primary antimalarial mechanism of action of these compounds was confirmed to be inhibition of pfDHOD through a secondary assay with transgenic malaria parasites, and the structural basis for enzyme inhibition was explored through in silico structure-based docking and site-directed mutagenesis. Compound-mediated cytotoxicity was not observed with human dermal fibroblasts or renal epithelial cells. These data validate pfDHOD as an antimalarial drug target and provide chemical scaffolds with which to begin medicinal chemistry efforts.",

To investigate the properties of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (TgDHOD), the fourth enzyme in the T. gondii pyrimidine pathway, we expressed and purified recombinant TgDHOD. TgDHOD exhibited a specific activity of 84U/mg, a k(cat) of 89s(-1), a K(m)=60\u03bcM for l-dihydroorotate, and a K(m)=29\u03bcM for decylubiquinone (Q(D)). Quinones lacking or having short isoprenoid side chains yielded lower k(cat)s than Q(D). As expected, fumarate was a poor electron acceptor for this family 2 DHOD. The IC(50)s determined for A77-1726, the active derivative of the human DHOD inhibitor leflunomide, and related compounds MD249 and MD209 were, 91\u03bcM, 96\u03bcM, and 60\u03bcM, respectively. The enzyme was not significantly affected by brequinar or TTFA, known inhibitors of human DHOD, or by atovaquone. DSM190, a known inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum DHOD, was a poor inhibitor of TgDHOD. TgDHOD exhibits a lengthy 157-residue N-terminal extension, consistent with a potential organellar targeting signal. We constructed C-terminally c-myc tagged TgDHODs to examine subcellular localization of TgDHOD in transgenic parasites expressing the tagged protein. Using both exogenous and endogenous expression strategies, anti-myc fluorescence signal colocalized with antibodies against the mitochondrial marker ATPase. These findings demonstrate that TgDHOD is associated with the parasite's mitochondrion, revealing this organelle as the site of orotate production in T. gondii. The TgDHOD gene appears to be essential because while gene tagging was successful at the TgDHOD gene locus, attempts to delete the TgDHOD gene were not successful in the KU80 background. Collectively, our study suggests that TgDHOD is an excellent target for the development of anti-Toxoplasma drugs.",

Brequinar sodium inhibits the activity of this enzyme isolated from mammalian sources only but not those forms isolated from yeast or bacteria, which also use ubiquinone as the cofactor. Brequinar sodium also does not inhibit the activity of a soluble Zymobacterium oroticum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase which uses NAD+ as a cofactor. Brequinar sodium inhibits L1210 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase with mixed inhibition kinetics with respect to either the substrate (dihydroorotate) or the cofactor (ubiquinone Q6) with Ki' values in the 5-8 nM range. Our results suggest that brequinar sodium inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by binding to the enzyme at a unique site that is distinct from the dihydroorotate or the ubiquinone-binding site. This binding site appears to be unique to the mammalian enzyme, because brequinar sodium does not inhibit the yeast, Escherichia coli, or Z. oroticum forms of the enzyme.",

The full-length cDNA sequence of <i>dhod</i> is 1339 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1173 bp that encoded a 390 amino acid protein.

The silkworm <i>dhod</i> is expressed throughout development and in nine tissues. Moreover, knockdown of the silkworm <i>dhod</i> gene reduced cell growth and proliferation through G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Similarly, DHODH inhibitor (leflunomide) also reduced cell growth and proliferation, with a significant decrease of <i>cyclin B</i> and <i>cdk2</i>. DHODH is the fourth enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis, so we also found that leflunomide can inhibit, at least in part, the endomitotic DNA replication in silk glands cells.

Translational and genetic research have identified new targets, for which new analgesics are being developed. This addresses voltage-gated sodium, calcium and potassium channels, for which SCN9A, CACNA1B, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, respectively, are primary gene candidates because they code for the subunits of the respective channels targeted by analgesics currently in clinical development. Mutations in voltage gated transient receptor potential (TRPV) channels are known from genetic pain research and may modulate the effects of analgesics under development targeting TRPV1 or TRPV3. To this add ligand-gated ion channels including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors and ATP-gated purinergic P2X receptors with most important subunits coded by CHRNA4, GRIN2B and P2RX7. Among G protein coupled receptors, \u03b4-opioid receptors (coded by OPRD1), cannabinoid receptors (CNR1 and CNR2), metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5 coded by GRM5), bradykinin B(1) (BDKRB1) and 5-HT(1A) (HTR1A) receptors are targeted by new analgesic substances. Finally, nerve growth factor (NGFB), its tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK1) and the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) have become targets of interest. For most of these genes, functional variants have been associated with neuro-psychiatric disorders and not yet with analgesia. However, research on the genetic modulation of pain has already identified variants in these genes, relative to pain, which may facilitate the pharmacogenetic assessments of new analgesics. The increased number of candidate pharmacogenetic modulators of analgesic actions may open opportunities for the broader clinical implementation of genotyping information.",

Morphine is the current gold standard analgesic acting at MOP receptors but produces a range of variably troublesome side-effects, in particular tolerance. There is now good laboratory evidence to suggest that blocking DOP while activating MOP produces analgesia (or antinociception) without the development of tolerance. Simultaneous targeting of MOP and DOP can be accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs, (ii) administering one non-selective drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand. Bivalent ligands generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature. For example linking the MOP agonist oxymorphone to the DOP antagonist naltrindole produces a MOP/DOP bivalent ligand that should produce analgesia with reduced tolerance. The type of response/selectivity produced depends on the pharmacophore combination (e.g. oxymorphone and naltrindole as above) and the space between them. Production and evaluation of bivalent ligands is an emerging field in drug design and for anaesthesia, analgesics that are designed not to be highly selective morphine-like (MOP) ligands represents a new avenue for the production of useful drugs for chronic (and in particular cancer) pain.",

We demonstrate that nuclear actin polymerization is required for the migration of a subset of double-strand breaks into discrete sub-nuclear clusters. Actin-driven movements specifically affect double-strand breaks repaired by homology-directed repair in G2 cell cycle phase; inhibition of actin nucleation impairs DNA end-processing and homology-directed repair. By contrast, ARP2/3 is not enriched at double-strand breaks repaired by non-homologous end joining and does not regulate non-homologous end joining.

The discovery of the existence of a prokaryotic cytoskeleton has changed this picture significantly. As a result, the idea has taken shape that the appearance of actin occurred in the very first cell; therefore, the emergence of microfilaments precedes that of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. The discovery of nuclear actin opened new perspective on the field, suggesting that the nuclear activities of actin reflect the functions of primordial actin-like proteins. In this paper, we review the recent literature to explore the evolutionary origin of nuclear actin. We conclude that both ancient and eukaryotic features of the actin world can be detected in the nucleus today, which supports the idea that the cytoskeleton attained significant eukaryotic innovations before the tandem evolution of the cytoskeleton and nucleus occurred.",

The revitalization of research into nuclear actin occurred after it was found that cellular stresses induce the nuclear localization and alter the structure of actin. These studies provided the first hints that actin has a nuclear function. Subsequently, it was established that the nuclear import and export of actin is highly regulated. While the structures of nuclear actin remain unclear, it can function as monomers, polymers, and even rods. Furthermore, even within a given structure, distinct pools of nuclear actin that can be differentially labeled have been identified. Numerous mechanistic studies have uncovered an array of functions for nuclear actin. It regulates the activity of RNA polymerases, as well as specific transcription factors. Actin also modulates the activity of several chromatin remodeling complexes and histone deacetylases, to ultimately impinge on transcriptional programing and DNA damage repair. Further, nuclear actin mediates chromatin movement and organization. It has roles in meiosis and mitosis, and these functions may be functionally conserved from ancient bacterial actin homologs. The structure and integrity of the nuclear envelope and sub-nuclear compartments are also regulated by nuclear actin. Furthermore, nuclear actin contributes to human diseases like cancer, neurodegeneration, and myopathies.

We report molecularly distinct phases of astrogliogenesis that exhibit stage- and lineage-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures with unique primed and active chromatin regions, thereby revealing regulatory elements and transcriptional programs underlying astrocyte generation and maturation. By searching for transcription factors that function at these elements, we identified NFIA and ATF3 as drivers of astrocyte differentiation from neural precursor cells while RUNX2 promotes astrocyte maturation. These transcription factors facilitate stage-specific gene expression programs by switching the chromatin state of their target regulatory elements from primed to active.

Treatment of RA has improved over the past decade. With multiple cytokines well-known now to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6, many targeted biological treatments against these cytokines have emerged, changing the treatment of this disease. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor and has been approved in many countries, including the United States, for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in patients who have not adequately responded to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or cannot tolerate other approved drug classes for RA. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of IL-6 in RA, and to provide an overview of the mode of action, pharmacokinetics, and safety of TCZ. Furthermore, efficacy studies of TCZ as both monotherapy and combination therapy will be evaluated. There have been several important clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of TCZ in RA patients; this review summarizes this data from 14 key trials with emphasis on Phase III trials. Review of these trials provides strong evidence that its use, both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate or other DMARDs, is an effective treatment in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA. TCZ showed tolerable safety but care is required for its use since there are some important safety concerns including elevated liver enzymes, elevated low-density lipoprotein, infections, and gastrointestinal perforations. Additionally, given the efficacy of TCZ in the treatment of RA, this review discusses how TCZ may be beneficial in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, spinal disease, cardiovascular disease, organ transplantation, and malignancies where elevated levels of IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",

For example, it stimulates the production of acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A) and hepcidin which interferes with iron recycling and absorption, causing iron-deficient anemia, and augments expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand in synovial cells, leading to neovascularization and osteoclast formation. IL-6 also acts on lymphocytes, not only on B cells to stimulate autoantibody production, but also on na\u00efve T helper cells to promote T<sub>h</sub>17 cell differentiation. Thus, an imbalance between T cell subsets possibly contributes to development of rheumatoid arthritis. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, improves clinical symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab prevented radiographic progression of joint destruction by inhibiting cartilage/bone resorption. Tocilizumab also improved hematological abnormalities, including hypergammaglobulinemia, high levels of autoantibodies, and elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and acute-phase proteins. Importantly, tocilizumab improved quality of life by reducing systemic symptoms, including fatigue, anemia, anorexia, and fever. These findings have confirmed that hyperproduction of IL-6 is responsible for the above clinical symptoms, including joint destruction.

The work investigated whether the observed decline in peripheral neutrophil and platelet counts after tocilizumab administration can be directly explained by tocilizumab IL-6R blockade, thus demonstrating the mechanism of tocilizumab action. Tocilizumab and total sIL-6R concentrations, neutrophil and platelet counts from 4 phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis patients were available. Patients received 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab intravenous infusions every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses. A population approach was applied to describe the relationship between tocilizumab and sIL-6R concentrations and subsequent changes in neutrophil and platelet counts. Following tocilizumab administration, concentrations of total sIL-6R increased, while neutrophil and platelet counts declined. These changes were transient, with counts returning to their respective baseline levels soon after tocilizumab is eliminated from the body. Tocilizumab concentrations were described by a two compartment model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The quasi-steady-state target-mediated drug disposition model described tocilizumab relationships to total sIL-6R, which allowed computation of unobserved unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The neutrophil counts were described as a direct function of unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The platelet counts were described by the transit-compartment life-span model with inhibition of production that depended on the unbound sIL-6R concentrations. Thus, the observed changes in sIL-6R, neutrophil, and platelet data are consistent with the tocilizumab mechanism of action and can be fully explained by tocilizumab binding to sIL-6R and mIL-6R.",

The study populations was drawn from 22 normozoospermic healthy volunteers which were incubated with or without AMPK activator (resveratrol [RSV], 15 \u00b5M) or inhibitor (Compound C [CC], 30 \u00b5M) for 1 h and were then cryopreserved. Untreated frozen-thawed spermatozoa served as controls.

The relative mRNA expression levels of protamines (1 and 2) and ADD1 in RSV pretreated frozen-thawed human spermatozoa were also improved significantly compared to the control (p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the inhibitory effect of CC on AMPK activity deteriorated the deleterious effects of cryopreservation on these parameters (p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, these results demonstrated the cryoprotective effect of the RSV-induced increase in AMPK activity on DNA integrity and key paternal transcripts of cryopreserved human spermatozoa. These findings are of great importance for improving the available cryopreservation protocols in terms of the number of lesions that produced over key genes and the dramatic effects on sperm DNA fragmentation.",

We isolated primary epididymal epithelial cells from rat epididymides and verified their phenotype by detecting the presence of cytokeratin-19 (CK-19, an epithelial cell marker) and the absence vimentin (an interstitial cell marker). We found that cultured epididymal epithelial cells isolated from rat epididymides expressed high levels of CK-19 but barely expressed vimentin. Gain-of-function assays, which included the CCK-8 assay and EdU flow cytometry assay, indicated that overexpression of OCTN2 significantly promoted epididymal epithelial cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, forced expression of OCTN2 inhibited the cell apoptosis process, and at the same time increased expression of the pro-apoptosis factor BAX, and decreased expression of the anti-apoptosis factors BCL-2 and Survivin. Furthermore, we also found that OCTN2 overexpression dramatically increased the levels of biomarkers associated with spermatogenesis, including azoospermia-like (DAZL), phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), and protamine 2 (PRM2). These results demonstrate that OCTN2 plays a positive role in epididymal epithelial cells, and might be useful in the clinical treatment of male infertility by serving as a key regulatory factor.",

Their function is strongly linked to sperm head morphology and male fertility. Protamines appear to be affected by a complex pattern of selective constraints. Previous studies showed that sexual selection affects protamine coding sequence and expression in rodents. Here we analyze selective constraints and post-copulatory sexual selection acting on protamine 2 (Prm2) gene sequences of 53 species of primates and rodents. We focused on possible differences in selective constraints between these two clades and on the two functional domains of PRM2 (cleaved- and mature-PRM2). We also assessed if and how changes in Prm2 coding sequence may affect sperm head dimensions. The domain of Prm2 that is cleaved off during binding to DNA (cleaved-Prm2) was found to be under purifying selection in both clades, whereas the domain that remains bound to DNA (mature-Prm2) was found to be positively selected in primates and under relaxed constraint in rodents. Changes in cleaved-Prm2 coding sequence are significantly correlated to sperm head width and elongation in rodents. Contrary to expectations, a significant effect of sexual selection was not found on either domain or clade. Mature-PRM2 may be free to evolve under less constraint due to the existence of PRM1 as a more conserved and functionally redundant copy. The cleaved-PRM2 domain seems to play an important role in sperm head shaping. However, sexual selection on its sequence may be difficult to detect until it is identified which sperm head phenotype (shape and size) confers advantages for sperm performance in different mammalian clades.",

In this study, we examined the fate of various testicular cells in adult mouse testes following ectopic autografting at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks post grafting. Histological examination showed no evidence of re-establishment of spermatogenesis in autografts, and progressive degeneration of seminiferous tubules was detected. Expression of germ cell-specific proteins such as POU5F1, DAZL, TNP1, TNP2, PRM1 and PRM2 revealed that, although proliferating and differentiating spermatogenic germ cells such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids could survive in autografts until 4 weeks, only terminally differentiated germ cells such as sperm persisted in autografts until 8 weeks. The presence of Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells, as indicated by expression of WT1 and ACTA2 proteins, respectively, was evident in the autografts until 8 weeks. Interestingly, seminal vesicle weight and serum testosterone level were restored in autografted mice by 8 weeks post grafting. The expression of Leydig cell-specific proteins such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and LHCGR showed revival of Leydig cell (LC) populations in autografts over time since grafting. Elevated expression of PDGFRA, LIF, DHH and NEFH in autografts indicated de novo regeneration of LC populations. Autografted adult testis can be used as a model for investigating Leydig cell regeneration, steroidogenesis and regulation of the intrinsic factors involved in Leydig cell development. The success of this rodent model can have therapeutic applications for adult human males undergoing sterilizing cancer therapy.",

Both the elevation and reduction of this ratio have been linked with male infertility suggesting that abnormalities in protamine expression, processing and replacement may be responsible for effects on semen parameters observed in infertile males affected by deficient protamination, along with abnormalities in associated regulatory processes. Abnormal protamination may result in insufficient condensation in the sperm nucleus, thus rendering paternal DNA susceptible to damage, which could have detrimental consequences upon embryogenesis. Consequently, it is imperative that Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) endeavour to utilise sperm devoid of protamine abnormalities, especially because retained histones are present in imprinted gene clusters. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormalities in protamine content may influence epigenetic signals transmitted via paternal DNA. Indeed, an increase in rare imprinting disorders has been observed in children conceived via in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

The expressions of miR-122 and runt-related transcription factors (RUNX2) in normal brain/glioma tissues and normal astrocytes (NHA)/multiple glioma cell lines (U87, U251, and U118) were analyzed by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Western blot and luciferase activity assays were performed to validate the predicted relationship between miR-122 and RUNX2. The effects of miR-122 on cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony forming, and Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis assays using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. MiR-122 expression is downregulated in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues, and is negatively correlated with the WHO grade. In contrast, the RUNX2 expression is upregulated in glioma tissues, and is positively correlated with the WHO grade. In glioma cell lines, the miR-122 expression is also constantly downregulated. MiR-122 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, which is achieved by directly targeting RUNX2. Overexpression of RUNX2 can partially abrogate the effect of miR-122 on glioma cells. These results demonstrate a crucial role of miR-122 in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Identifying the miR-122/RUNX2 signaling provides novel insights into the development of therapeutic targets for glioma.",

It may also be administered as monotherapy in patients intolerant of methotrexate or in whom methotrexate therapy is inappropriate. Tocilizumab is also approved in Japan for the treatment of polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Castleman's disease. Intravenous tocilizumab was effective and generally well tolerated when administered either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional DMARDs in several well designed clinical studies in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab-based therapy was consistently more effective than placebo, methotrexate or other DMARDs in reducing disease activity, and some trials also showed significant benefits with tocilizumab in terms of reducing structural joint damage and improving health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Notably, tocilizumab-based therapy was effective in patients with long-standing disease in whom anti-TNF therapy had previously failed.

Upregulation of hepcidin by inflammatory cytokines has been implicated in AI. In this study, we evaluated and compared the effects of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 blocking therapies on anemia, disease activity, and iron-related parameters including serum hepcidin in RA patients. Patients (n = 93) were treated with an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab) or TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors for 16 weeks. Major disease activity indicators and iron-related parameters including serum hepcidin-25 were monitored before and 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Effects of tocilizumab and infliximab (anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody) on cytokine-induced hepcidin expression in hepatoma cells were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Anemia at base line was present in 66% of patients. Baseline serum hepcidin-25 levels were correlated positively with serum ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28). Significant improvements in anemia and disease activity, and reductions in serum hepcidin-25 levels were observed within 2 weeks in both groups, and these effects were more pronounced in the tocilizumab group than in the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors group. Serum hepcidin-25 reduction by the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor therapy was accompanied by a decrease in serum IL-6, suggesting that the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on the induction of hepcidin-25 was indirect. In in vitro experiments, stimulation with the cytokine combination of IL-6+TNF-\u03b1 induced weaker hepcidin expression than did with IL-6 alone, and this induction was completely suppressed by tocilizumab but not by infliximab. Hepcidin-mediated iron metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA-related anemia. In our cohort, tocilizumab was more effective than TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors for improving anemia and normalizing iron metabolism in RA patients by inhibiting hepcidin production.",

Given their structural and functional differences, distinct safety profiles can be expected for each of these agents. Evidence in the literature indicates that patients treated with anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents and tocilizumab are at increased risk for bacterial infections. However, an increased therapeutic use of these biological agents has disclosed other side-effects, including immediate hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis and urticaria. Both under-diagnosis and over-diagnosis of hypersensitivity reactions to biological agents are potential problems. Thus, it is important to identify these reactions and to adopt the right approach to manage them.

Indeed, worldwide clinical trials of TNF inhibiting biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept as well as the humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, have demonstrated outstanding clinical efficacy and tolerable safety profiles, resulting in worldwide approval for using these bDMARDs to treat moderate to severe active RA in patients with an inadequate response to synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs). Although bDMARDs have elicited to a paradigm shift in the treatment of RA due to the prominent efficacy that had not been previously achieved by sDMARDs, a substantial percentage of patients failed primary or secondary responses to bDMARD therapy.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26154623": "Plasma-derived vesicles hold a promising potential for use in biomedical applications. Two major challenges, however, hinder their implementation into translational tools: (a) the incomplete characterization of the protein composition of plasma-derived vesicles, in the size range of exosomes, as mass spectrometric analysis of plasma sub-components is recognizably troublesome and (b) the limited reach of vesicle-based studies in settings where the infrastructural demand of ultracentrifugation, the most widely used isolation/purification methodology, is not available. In this study, we have addressed both challenges by carrying-out mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of plasma-derived vesicles, in the size range of exosomes, from healthy donors obtained by 2 alternative methodologies: size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on sepharose columns and Exo-Spin\u2122. No exosome markers, as opposed to the most abundant plasma proteins, were detected by Exo-Spin\u2122. In contrast, exosomal markers were present in the early fractions of SEC where the most abundant plasma proteins have been largely excluded. Noticeably, after a cross-comparative analysis of all published studies using MS to characterize plasma-derived exosomes from healthy individuals, we also observed a paucity of \"classical exosome markers.\" Independent of the isolation method, however, we consistently identified 2 proteins, CD5 antigen-like (CD5L) and galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP), whose presence was validated by a bead-exosome FACS assay. Altogether, our results support the use of SEC as a stand-alone methodology to obtain preparations of extracellular vesicles, in the size range of exosomes, from plasma and suggest the use of CD5L and LGALS3BP as more suitable markers of plasma-derived vesicles in MS.",

We analyzed exosomes from mouse (C57Bl/6) and breast, lung, and ovarian cancer patient samples and cultured cancer cells with different approaches, including nanoparticle tracking analysis, biolayer interferometry, FACS, and electron microscopy. Data were analyzed with the Student's t and Mann-Whitney tests. All statistical tests were two-sided. We showed that the A8 peptide aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of membrane HSP70 and used the aptamer to capture HSP70 exosomes from cancer patient samples. The number of HSP70 exosomes was higher in cancer patients than in healthy donors (mean, ng/mL \u00b1 SD = 3.5 \u00b1 1.7 vs 0.17 \u00b1 0.11, respectively, P = .004). Accordingly, all cancer cell lines examined abundantly released HSP70 exosomes, whereas \"normal\" cells did not. HSP70 had higher affinity for A8 than for TLR2; thus, A8 blocked HSP70/TLR2 association and the ability of tumor-derived exosomes to activate MDSCs. Treatment of tumor-bearing C57Bl/6 mice with A8 induced a decrease in the number of MDSCs in the spleen and inhibited tumor progression (n = 6 mice per group). Chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or 5FU increase the amount of HSP70 exosomes, favoring the activation of MDSCs and hampering the development of an antitumor immune response. In contrast, this MDSC activation was not observed if cisplatin or 5FU was combined with A8. As a result, the antitumor effect of the drugs was strongly potentiated. A8 might be useful for quantifying tumor-derived exosomes and for cancer therapy through MDSC inhibition.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30290833": " Microenvironment cues involved in melanoma progression are largely unknown. Melanoma is highly influenced in its aggressive phenotype by the changes it determinates in its microenvironment, such as pH decrease, in turn influencing cancer cell invasiveness, progression and tissue remodelling through an abundant secretion of exosomes, dictating cancer strategy to the whole host. A role of exosomes in driving melanoma progression under microenvironmental acidity was never described. We studied four differently staged human melanoma lines, reflecting melanoma progression, under microenvironmental acidic pHs pressure ranging between pH 6.0-6.7. To estimate exosome secretion as a function of tumor stage and environmental pH, we applied a technique to generate native fluorescent exosomes characterized by vesicles integrity, size, density, markers expression, and quantifiable by direct FACS analysis. Functional roles of exosomes were tested in migration and invasion tests. Then we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of acid versus control exosomes to elucidate a specific signature involved in melanoma progression. We found that metastatic melanoma secretes a higher exosome amount than primary melanoma, and that acidic pH increases exosome secretion when melanoma is in an intermediate stage, i.e. metastatic non-invasive. We were thus able to show that acidic pH influences the intercellular cross-talk mediated by exosomes. In fact when exposed to exosomes produced in an acidic medium, pH na\u00efve melanoma cells acquire migratory and invasive capacities likely due to transfer of metastatic exosomal proteins, favoring cell motility and angiogenesis. A Prognoscan-based meta-analysis study of proteins enriched in acidic exosomes, identified 11 genes (HRAS, GANAB, CFL2, HSP90B1, HSP90AB1, GSN, HSPA1L, NRAS, HSPA5, TIMP3, HYOU1), significantly correlating with poor prognosis, whose high expression was in part confirmed in bioptic samples of lymph node metastases. A crucial step of melanoma progression does occur at melanoma intermediate -stage, when extracellular acidic pH induces an abundant release and intra-tumoral uptake of exosomes. Such exosomes are endowed with pro-invasive molecules of clinical relevance, which may provide a signature of melanoma advancement.",

The first evidence for long-term transmission of CT's toxic effect via extracellular vesicles was obtained in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To follow the CT intracellular route towards exosome secretion, we used a novel strategy for generating metabolically-labeled fluorescent exosomes that can be counted by flow cytometry assay (FACS) and characterized. Our results clearly show the association of CT with exosomes, together with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) molecules, proteins required for translocation of CTA across the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy showed direct internalization of CT containing fluorescent exo into CHO cells coupled with morphological changes in the recipient cells that are characteristic of CT action. Moreover, Me665 cells treated with CT-containing exosomes showed an increase in Adenosine 3',5'-Cyclic Monophosphate (cAMP) level, reaching levels comparable to those seen in cells exposed directly to CT. Our results prompt the idea that CT can exploit an exosome-mediated cell communication pathway to extend its pathophysiological action beyond an initial host cell, into a multitude of cells.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG), which produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission to NICE. Nivolumab was compared with docetaxel, paclitaxel, best supportive care and retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine, but only for patients whose disease has had an adequate response in first-line treatment). Two ongoing, phase I/II, single-arm studies for nivolumab were identified, but no studies directly compared nivolumab with any specified comparator. Evidence from directly examining the single arms of the trial data indicated little difference between the outcomes measured from the nivolumab and comparator studies. A simulated treatment comparison (STC) analysis was used in an attempt to reduce the bias induced by na\u00efve comparison, but there was no clear evidence that risk of bias was reduced. Multiple limitations in the STC were identified and remained. The effect of an analysis based on different combinations of covariates in the prediction model remains unknown. The ERG's concerns regarding the economic analysis included the use of a non-established response-based survival analysis method, which introduced additional uncertainty. The use of time-dependent hazard ratios produced overfitting and was not represented in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The use of a treatment stopping rule to cap treatment cost left treatment effectiveness unaltered. A relevant comparator was excluded from the base-case analysis.

In Medicaid, African-Americans had lower odds of initiating (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.51-0.68 in early untreated RA; OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.61-0.74 in prevalent RA) and switching (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55-0.90) biologic DMARDs than non-Hispanic whites. Prior use of steroid and non-biologic DMARDs predicted both biologic DMARD initiation and subsequent switching. Etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab were the most commonly used first-line and second-line biologic DMARDS; patients on anakinra and golimumab were most likely to be switched to other biologic DMARDS. Insurance type, race, and previous use of steroids and non-biologic DMARDs were strongly associated with initial or subsequent treatment with biologic DMARDs.",

Patients were grouped according to treatment history and treatment initiated: DMARD-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ + DMARD (DMARD-IR TCZ) or TNFi + DMARD (DMARD-IR TNFi), DMARD-IR and/or TNFi-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ monotherapy (TCZ mono) or TNFi monotherapy (TNFi mono), and TNFi-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ + DMARD (TNFi-IR TCZ) or TNFi + DMARD (TNFi-IR TNFi). Patients initiating treatment with TCZ generally had more severe disease and longer disease duration compared with the corresponding TNFi group. Significantly more patients achieved remission (DAS28 ESR &lt;2.6) in the TCZ groups compared with corresponding TNFi groups (DMARD-IR, TCZ 44.0 % vs. TNFi 29.6 %; monotherapy, TCZ 37.2 % vs. TNFi 30.2 %; TNF-IR, TCZ 41.3 % vs. TNFi 19.2 %; p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons). More patients achieved moderate-good responses (EULAR criteria) in the TCZ treatment groups (79-85 %) compared with TNFi treatment groups (65-81 %). Patient-reported outcomes showed greater improvements in TCZ compared with TNFi groups. In patients with inadequate response to DMARDs and/or TNFi treated in routine clinical practice, TCZ in combination with DMARDs or as monotherapy resulted in significantly more patients achieving remission and more marked improvements in patient-reported outcomes compared with TNF inhibitors.",

Few studies have examined the factors associated with the transition from nonbiologic DMARDs, the first-line therapy for RA, to biologic DMARDs in RA patients. To examine patient sociodemographics, medication use patterns, and clinical characteristics associated with initiation of biologic DMARDs. This was a retrospective study using the Texas Medicaid prescription and medical claims database from July 1, 2003-December 31, 2010. Adults (aged 18-63 years) with an RA diagnosis (ICD-9-CM code 714.xx), no nonbiologic DMARD or biologic DMARD use during the 6-month pre-index period, and a minimum of 2 prescription claims for the same nonbiologic DMARD during the post-index period were included in the study. The index date was defined as the date when the first nonbiologic DMARD claim was made. Predictors of initiation of biologic DMARDs were age, gender, race, adherence (proportion of days covered), persistence to nonbiologic DMARDs, comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), pain medication use, glucocorticoid use, and rheumatologist visit. Logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with the initiation of biologic DMARDs. A total of 2,714 patients were included. After controlling for patient characteristics, logistic regression showed, that compared with methotrexate (MTX) users, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) users were less likely to initiate biologic DMARDs by 69.0% (OR = 0.310, 95% CI = 0.221-0.434, P less than 0.0001) and 79.9% (OR = 0.201, 95% CI = 0.152-0.265, P less than 0.0001), respectively. Nonbiologic DMARD dual therapy users were 39.1% less likely to initiate biologic DMARDs compared with nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy users (OR = 0.609, 95% CI = 0.463-0.803, P = 0.0004). With each year increase in age, patients were 1.6% less likely to start biologic DMARDs (OR = 0.984, 95% CI = 0.975-0.993, P = 0.0006). Compared with glucocorticoid users, glucocorticoid nonusers were 53.8% less likely to start on biologic DMARDs (OR = 0.462, 95% CI = 0.372-0.573, P less than 0.0001). Patients with CCI scores of \u2265 3 were approximately 1.6 times more likely to initiate biologic DMARDs than those with CCI scores of 1 (OR = 1.618, 95% CI = 1.228-2.132, P = 0.0006). Younger age, CCI scores \u22653, glucocorticoid use, MTX users (vs. SSZ and HCQ users), and nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy users (vs. dual therapy users) were significantly associated with higher likelihood to initiate biologic DMARDs. Recognizing these potential factors that drive the initiation of biologic DMARDs in this patient population, health care providers and Texas Medicaid should take measures to achieve optimal therapy for RA patients through thorough RA medication evaluation, well-structured RA monitoring programs, and patient education.",

This study aimed to reveal treatment patterns with traditional DMARDs and their changes during the two decades before the recent introduction of new DMARDs. A total of 593 RA patients were followed from their first presentation to our clinic throughout the course of their disease; 222 patients received their first DMARD therapy while under our care. More than 2,300 patient years of therapy were analysed for the efficacy [using C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as surrogates] and duration of drug therapy of consecutive DMARDs. Before 1985, 65-90% of initial DMARDs were gold compounds, but their use decreased continuously thereafter. Antimalarial (AM) drugs were important initial DMARDs in new patients at all times, whereas sulphasalazine (SSZ) and methotrexate (MTX) gained increasing significance after 1985 (the first DMARD was MTX in up to 29% of new patients). Penicillamine (DPA), azathioprine (AZP), cyclosporin (CyA) and combination therapies were not usually employed initially, but were reserved for the later course of the disease. Gender, age and rheumatoid factor were not different between patients receiving different DMARDs. The baseline acute-phase response was higher in patients treated with MTX (mean CRP 3.5 mg/dl) than in those treated with SSZ (CRP 2.4 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.05) or AM (CRP 2.1 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that MTX was used preferentially in patients with high disease activity. On the other hand, once AM or SSZ had been discontinued, MTX was the most common subsequent DMARD (in 31 and 56% respectively). Comparison of first DMARDs with subsequent ones revealed that first DMARDs were more effective: the acute-phase response decreased most prominently during first therapies (CRP reduction was 1.28 mg/dl during first courses and 0.35 mg/dl during fourth or later courses; P &lt; 0.01); and retention rates were significantly longer for first compared with subsequent therapies (median of 24.5 months for first and 18.6 months for fourth or subsequent therapies; P &lt; 0.001). MTX was the most commonly employed DMARD therapy for RA and was used increasingly as first therapy in newly diagnosed RA. Patients with high disease activity were given MTX therapy more often than other DMARDs, while those with low activity were more likely to receive SSZ or AM, and MTX on failure of these drugs. First DMARDs in new patients were retained longer than subsequent DMARDs, apparently because they are more effective.",

It is important to select an appropriate DMARD for the patient. However, 57 of the 171 patients showed an adverse reaction toward one DMARD and 26 (46%) of these 57 patients showed undesirable reactions to other DMARDs. In this paper we emphasized (1) that this rate 46% of adverse reaction against multiple DMARDs was elevated and (2) that the rate of frequency of adverse reactions against two drugs was elevated. The ranking orders of the frequency of the adverse reactions of the switching of one DMARD to another are as follows; 1. gold sodium thiomalate to D-penicillamine, 2. gold sodium thiomalate to bucillamine, 3. D-penicillamine to bucillamine. Therefore, a special attention for switching DMARDs should be paid to the patient who has already shown an adverse reaction to one DMARD, and we should lower the dose of DMARDs administered to the patient. In addition, steroid was found not to decrease the rates of the adverse reaction against DMARDs.",

JAKs have a pivotal role in triggering cytokine-induced signal transduction pathways that influence normal and pathological cellular processes of haematopoiesis and immune cell function, including pathogenic mechanisms involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Selective inhibition of JAKs by tofacitinib potentially modulates inflammatory processes and provides a novel approach for the treatment of RA. Oral tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate and/or other DMARDs. In several large well designed trials, tofacitinib, in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiological DMARDs or as monotherapy, was an effective and generally well tolerated DMARD for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had had an inadequate response to previous DMARDs, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibitors. Direct head-to-head trials and/or further clinical experience (including long-term safety data), along with robust pharmacoeconomic studies, are required to more definitively position tofacitinib relative to other currently available DMARDs. In the meantime, tofacitinib (alone or in combination with nonbiological DMARDs) is an emerging option for the treatment of DMARD-experienced adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of methotrexate or other DMARDs.",

We examined predictors of starting and stopping DMARDs among a longitudinal cohort of patients with RA. Study participants came from a cohort of RA patients recruited from a random sample of rheumatologists' practices in Northern California. We examined patterns and predictors of stopping and starting nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs during 1982-2009 based on annual questionnaires. Stopping was defined as stopping all DMARDs and starting was defined as transitioning from no DMARDs to any DMARDs across 2 consecutive years. The analysis of starting DMARDs included 471 subjects with 1,974 pairs of years with no DMARD use in the first of 2 consecutive years. From this population, subjects started DMARD use by year 2 in 313 (15.9%) of the pairs. The analysis of stopping DMARDs included 1,026 subjects with 7,595 pairs of years with DMARD use in the first of 2 consecutive years; in 423 pairs (5.6%), subjects stopped DMARD use by year 2. In models that adjusted for RA-related factors, sociodemographics, and comorbidities, significant predictors of starting DMARDs included younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, shorter disease duration, and the use of oral glucocorticoids. In separate adjusted models, predictors of stopping DMARDs included Hispanic ethnicity and low income, while younger age was associated with a reduced risk of stopping. Efforts to improve DMARD use should focus on patient age, ethnicity, and income and RA-related factors.",

RA subjects identified with the Quebec administrative databases were followed between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. DMARD use was characterized on November 1 of each year using cross-sectional analyses. For a subgroup of newly diagnosed subjects, we used multivariable logistic regressions to identify predictors of DMARD initiation within 12 months of diagnosis and survival analyses to appraise time to DMARD initiation. A total of 37,399 subjects were included (65.8 % \u226565 years; 70.5 % female). The percentage of subjects using any DMARDs increased over the study period from 41.4 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 40.8-42.0] to 43.3 % (95 % CI 42.7-43.9). Among newly diagnosed RA, being followed by a rheumatologist was the strongest predictor of DMARD initiation (odds ratio 4.31; 95 % CI 3.73-4.97). Care by an internist, increasing calendar year, use of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, or opioids, and a history of hospitalization increased the likelihood of DMARD initiation. Older age, female, higher comorbidity score, number of medical visits pre-diagnosis, care by other specialists, and the use of acetaminophen were inversely associated with DMARD initiation. The probability of any DMARD initiation at 12 months was 38.5 %. Despite the clinical practice guideline recommendations for earlier aggressive RA management, DMARD use appears to be suboptimal in Quebec.",

This review addresses this question by summarising the clinical evidence about DMARD withdrawal. It includes an assessment of predictive factors for sustained DMARD-free remissions. We evaluated the evidence for discontinuing DMARDs in stable RA in both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Six RCTs evaluated DMARD monotherapy withdrawal in 501 RA patients with good clinical responses. Flares occurred in 43/248 (17%) patients who continued DMARD monotherapy and in 117/253 (46%) patients who discontinued DMARDs. Individuals in whom DMARDs were withdrawn were three times more likely to have flares. Restarting DMARDs post-flare was usually successful. Four RCTs evaluated step-down DMARD combinations in comparison to DMARD monotherapy. Patients achieved good clinical responses with combination DMARDs, which were maintained after treatment was tapered to DMARD monotherapy. Four observational studies of tapering or stopping DMARDs in patients with sustained low disease activity states provided supportive evidence for discontinuing DMARDs in some patients. Flares during drug-free remissions were predicted by rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody status. Drug-free remission is achievable in some RA patients. Discontinuation of DMARDs after patients achieve sustained remissions results in flares in many patients, which can usually be reversed by restarting DMARDs. Step-down DMARD combinations are effective and achieve sustained responses. Further research is required to establish predictors of drug-free remission; these will identify individuals most likely to benefit or experience disease flares after discontinuing DMARDs.",

Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses. With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies, greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (aTNF) or tofacitinib. Furthermore, ACR20/50/70 responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab monotherapy (odds ratio [OR] for the indirect comparison = 1.08, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.40-2.84; OR = 1.24, CrI = 0.44-3.61; OR = 0.95, CrI = 0.33-2.72, respectively), whereas greater responses were observed with aTNF plus MTX than with aTNF monotherapy (OR = 2.41, CrI = 0.51-11.61; OR = 2.85, CrI = 0.51-17.67; OR = 1.28, CrI = 0.21-8.42, respectively). Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib. ACR responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab as monotherapy, whereas aTNF in combination with MTX demonstrated greater ACR responses than aTNF as monotherapy.",

However, these studies evaluated DMARDs with different mechanisms of action (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, etanercept, intravenous immunoglobulin, tocilizumab) and used varying comparators and follow-up periods. Rates of serious adverse events are similar between DMARDs and placebo in published trials. This review identified 11 incident cases of cancer among several thousand children treated with one or more DMARD. Few data are available to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of either specific DMARDs or general classes of DMARDs. However, based on the overall number, quality, and consistency of studies, there is moderate strength of evidence to support that DMARDs improve JIA-associated symptoms.

About 83% of population worldwide uses DMARDs. Withdrawal of COX-2 inhibitors because of cardiovascular side effects and short-term action associated with glucocorticoids provided a motivation for development of newer DMARDs. Currently non- biological DMARDs like methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine serve the purpose of relieving pain and inhibiting the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs like toclizumab, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab and abatacept have shown more efficacy and lesser side effects as compared to non- biological DMARDs but their access to patient is less because of higher cost. DMARDs act by different mechanisms against inflammation like inhibition of tumor necrosis factor, suppression of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1, induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells, by increasing chemotactic factors, inhibition of purine synthesis, pyrimidine metabolism or purine embolism.

In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with 32 patients with inflammatory arthritis who recently consulted their rheumatologist and discussed initiating DMARDs. Beliefs in the necessity of DMARDs, either for relief of symptoms or prevention of future joint damage, were reasons to initiate DMARDs. Furthermore, trust in the rheumatologist and the health care system was important in this respect. Patients expressed many concerns about initiating DMARDS. These related to the perceived aggressive and harmful nature of DMARDs, potential (or unknown) side effects, influence on fertility and pregnancy, combination with other medicines, time to benefit, and manner of administration. Participants also worried about the future regarding long-term medication use and drug dependency, and if a medicine proved to be ineffective, about the risks of future treatments and running out of options. To decrease uncertainty, participants wanted to be informed about multiple treatment options, both current and future. They not only wanted clinical information but also information on how the medications could affect their daily lives. Health education should inform patients about multiple treatment options, for the present as well as for the future.

Combination studies have focused on use of rapidly decreasing high-dose steroids as a part of the combination and emphasize the importance of using patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. Even with relatively aggressive use of DMARDs, the majority of patients develop erosions. Adverse reactions to DMARDs continue to concern clinicians, although evaluation of the frequency of these events has led to a reappraisal of previously accepted monitoring strategies in some cases. For example, it may not be cost-effective to subject patients on antimalarials to regular review by an ophthalmologist because of the low frequency of serious eye defects.

Methotrexate should be the first-line therapy for most rheumatoid arthritis patients and will produce the desired results in greater than one-third of the patients. When methotrexate is not adequate, triple DMARD therapy should be added which will result in control of approximately another one-third of the patients. Ultimately, and usually before 1 year of disease, the remainder of patients will require biological therapies usually added to conventional DMARDs. There is no evidence that this step-up approach results in any long-term disadvantage and good evidence that it results in substantial cost savings.",

Inadequate mitochondrial function has been found responsible for very diverse diseases, ranging from neurological pathologies to cancer. Interestingly, mitochondria have recently been shown to display the capacity to be transferred between cell types, notably from human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to cancer cells in coculture conditions, with metabolic and functional consequences for the mitochondria recipient cells, further enhancing the current interest for the biological properties of these organelles. Evaluating the effects of the transferred MSC mitochondria in the target cells is of primary importance to understand the biological outcome of such cell-cell interactions. The MitoCeption protocol described here allows the transfer of the mitochondria isolated beforehand from the donor cells to the target cells, using MSC mitochondria and glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) as a model system. This protocol has previously been used to transfer mitochondria, isolated from MSCs, to adherent MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. This mitochondria transfer protocol is adapted here for GSCs that present the specific particularity of growing as neurospheres in vitro. The transfer of the isolated mitochondria can be followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal imaging using mitochondria vital dyes. The use of mitochondria donor and target cells with distinct haplotypes (SNPs) also allows detection of the transferred mitochondria based on the concentration of their circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the target cells. Once the protocol has been validated with these criteria, the cells harboring the transferred mitochondria can be further analyzed to determine the effects of the exogenous mitochondria on biological properties such as cell metabolism, plasticity, proliferation and response to therapy.",

Mitochondria dysfunction constitutes a hallmark of many genetic diseases and plays a key role in tumor progression. The essential role of mitochondria, added to their recently documented capacity to transfer from cell to cell, obviously contributes to their current interest. However, determining the proper role of mitochondria in defined biological contexts was hampered by the lack of suitable experimental tools. We designed a protocol (MitoCeption) to directly and quantitatively transfer mitochondria, isolated from cell type A, to recipient cell type B. We validated and quantified the effective mitochondria transfer by imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and mitochondrial DNA analysis. We show that the transfer of minute amounts of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) mitochondria to cancer cells, a process otherwise occurring naturally in coculture, results in cancer cell enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity and favors cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The MitoCeption technique, which can be applied to different cell systems, will therefore be a method of choice to analyze the metabolic modifications induced by exogenous mitochondria in host cells.",

Randomized, controlled, multicenter trials were reviewed and included to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PCV13. Literature on the epidemiology and pathology of pneumococcal infections and recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were also reviewed. PCV13 is approved for routine vaccination of all infants as a 4-dose series at age 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months for children who previously received 1 or more doses of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), and for children with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease or its complications. PCV13 has comparable immunogenicity to the serotypes common with PCV7 and also provides protection against 6 additional pneumococcal serotypes. PCV13 has also been shown to have a comparable adverse reaction profile to PCV7.

Secukinumab (SEC; COSENTYX<sup>\u00ae</sup>, Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) and certolizumab pegol (CZP; CIMZIA<sup>\u00ae</sup>, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) have not previously been appraised by NICE. To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CZP and SEC for treating active PsA in adults in whom DMARDs have been inadequately effective. Systematic review and economic model. Fourteen databases (including MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched for relevant studies from inception to April 2016 for CZP and SEC studies; update searches were run to identify new comparator studies. Clinical effectiveness data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were synthesised using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) methods to investigate the relative efficacy of SEC and CZP compared with comparator therapies. A de novo model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SEC and CZP compared with the other relevant comparators. The model was specified for three subpopulations, in accordance with the NICE scope (patients who have taken one prior DMARD, patients who have taken two or more prior DMARDs and biologic-experienced patients). The models were further classified according to the level of concomitant psoriasis. Nineteen eligible RCTs were included in the systematic review of short-term efficacy. Most studies were well conducted and were rated as being at low risk of bias. Trials of SEC and CZP demonstrated clinically important efficacy in all key clinical outcomes. At 3 months, patients taking 150 mg of SEC [relative risk (RR) 6.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.55 to 15.43] or CZP (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.94 to 5.56) were more likely to be responders than patients taking placebo. The NMA results for the biologic-naive subpopulations indicated that the effectiveness of SEC and CZP relative to other biologics and each other was uncertain. Limited data were available for the biologic-experienced subpopulation. Longer-term evidence suggested that these newer biologics reduced disease progression, with the benefits being similar to those seen for older biologics. The de novo model generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three subpopulations and three psoriasis subgroups. In subpopulation 1 (biologic-naive patients who had taken one prior DMARD), CZP was the optimal treatment in the moderate-severe psoriasis subgroup and 150 mg of SEC was optimal in the subgroups of patients with mild-moderate psoriasis or no concomitant psoriasis. In subpopulation 2 (biologic-naive patients who had taken two or more prior DMARDs), etanercept (ETN; ENBREL<sup>\u00ae</sup>, Pfizer Inc., New York City, NY, USA) is likely to be the optimal treatment in all subgroups. The ICERs for SEC and CZP versus best supportive care are in the region of \u00a320,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In subpopulation 3 (biologic-experienced patients or patients in whom biologics are contraindicated), UST is likely to be the optimal treatment (ICERs are in the region of \u00a321,000-27,000 per QALY). The optimal treatment in subpopulation 2 was sensitive to the choice of evidence synthesis model.

In 22 of the 23 patients in the GRAID-2 registry, rituximab (RIX) was administered, while 1 patient was given tocilizumab as off-label therapy. The 22 patients who received RIX treatment were analyzed. At the start of treatment, the following active manifestations were present: myositis (n = 18), lung involvement (mainly interstitial lung disease; n = 10), arthritis (n = 10), skin manifestation (n = 9), and Raynaud syndrome (n = 5). Nine of the patients were Jo-1-antibody positive. All patients had previous treatments with multiple conventional immunosuppressive drugs. Treatment with RIX was given as infusions of 1 g i. v., which were repeated after 2 weeks. Patients received a mean of 3.09 \u00b1 2.27 infusions (equivalent to 1.5 cycles of 2 \u00d7 1 g, max. 5 cycles). Tolerability of RIX treatment was rated as very good in 16 of 22 patients (72%), good in 5 (23%), and moderate in 1 (5%). In all, 27 adverse events were documented, with the majority being infections, whereby 2 severe infections occurred (6.59 per 100 patient-years). Eighty six percent of the patients showed complete remission of their myositis and 79% of their arthritis. The mean value of creatinine kinase in plasma fell from 1505 \u00b1 2534 U/l before the start of treatment to 39 \u00b1 134 U/l at the last visit. Regarding lung involvement, 1 of 10 of the patients showed complete and 6 of 10 partial remissions. In 2 of 10 patients, lung disease was stable during treatment. RIX is the preferred off-label biologic drug for poly- and dermatomyositis in Germany. In spite of a strongly pretreated group of patients, the tolerability is acceptable, although the patient number in this investigation is small. Moreover, the results lead to the assumption that the majority of the patients had a good or even very good therapeutic response to RIX.",

In this study, we determined that the mean movement velocity of mitochondria in MNTs between CMs and MFs was approximately 17.5 \u00b1 2.1 nm/s. Meanwhile, treatment with microtubule polymerisation inhibitors nocodazole or colcemid in cell culture decreased mitochondrial velocity, and knockdown of the microtubule motor protein kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) led to a similar effect, indicating that mitochondrial movement was dependent on microtubules and the motor protein KIF5B. Furthermore, we showed that hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced CM apoptosis was attenuated by coculture with intact or hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated MFs, which transferred mitochondria to CMs. This rescue was prevented either by separating the cells using Transwell culture or by impairing mitochondrial transfer with nocodazole or colcemid treatment.

Here, I present a novel insight that may clarify the way V. cholerae quorum-sensing signals regulate its genes. Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), which occur worldwide and are frequently the insect found most abundantly in fresh water bodies, are natural reservoirs of V. cholerae. Quorum-sensing signals in V. cholerae up-regulate the production of an extracellular enzyme, haemagglutinin protease (HAP), which degrades chironomid egg masses and prevents the eggs from hatching. HAP, therefore, is a virulence factor against chironomids. Indeed, in a survey carried out over the course of a year, V. cholerae and chironomids showed a pattern that mirrored the dynamics of predator-prey populations. Globally, the numbers of chironomids are much larger than those of humans, so quorum-sensing signals of V. cholerae and HAP gene regulation should be understood with regard to their role in chironomids rather than humans.

Most commonly, deficits of galactosylceramidase result in widespread central and peripheral nervous system demyelination and death in affected infants typically by 2 years of age. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the current standard of care in children diagnosed prior to symptom onset. However, disease correction is incomplete. Herein, the first adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy experiments are presented in a naturally occurring canine model of GLD that closely recapitulates the clinical disease progression, neuropathological alterations, and biochemical abnormalities observed in human patients. Adapted from studies in twitcher mice, GLD dogs were treated by combination intravenous and intracerebroventricular injections of AAVrh10 to target both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Combination of intravenous and intracerebroventricular AAV gene therapy had a clear dose response and resulted in delayed onset of clinical signs, extended life-span, correction of biochemical defects, and attenuation of neuropathology. For the first time, therapeutic effect has been established in the canine model of GLD by targeting both peripheral and central nervous system impairments with potential clinical implications for GLD patients.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29391017": " Krabbe disease is a rare neurodegenerative genetic disorder caused by deficiency of galactocerebrosidase. Patients with the infantile form of Krabbe disease can be treated at a presymptomatic stage with human stem cell transplantation which improves survival and clinical outcomes. However, without a family history, most cases of infantile Krabbe disease present after onset of symptoms and are ineligible for transplantation. In 2006, New York began screening newborns for Krabbe disease to identify presymptomatic cases. To ensure that those identified with infantile disease received timely treatment, New York public health and medical systems took steps to accurately diagnose and rapidly refer infants for human stem cell transplantation within the first few weeks of life. After 11 years of active screening in New York and the introduction of Krabbe disease newborn screening in other states, new information has been gained which can inform the design of newborn screening programs to improve infantile Krabbe disease outcomes. Recent information relevant to Krabbe disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment were assessed by a diverse group of public health, medical, and advocacy professionals. Outcomes after newborn screening may improve if treatment for infantile disease is initiated before 30 days of life. Newer laboratory screening and diagnostic tools can improve the speed and specificity of diagnosis and help facilitate this early referral. Given the rarity of Krabbe disease, most recommendations were based on case series or expert opinion. This report updates recommendations for Krabbe disease newborn screening to improve the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment of infantile Krabbe disease. In the United States, several states have begun or are considering Krabbe disease newborn screening. These recommendations can guide public health laboratories on methodologies for screening and inform clinicians about the need to promptly diagnose and treat infantile Krabbe disease. The timing of the initial referral after newborn screening, the speed of diagnostic confirmation of infantile disease, and the transplantation center's experience and ability to rapidly respond to a suspected patient with newly diagnosed infantile Krabbe disease are critical for optimal outcomes.",

We present two sisters from a consanguineous Iraqi Kurdish family with predominant axial and limb girdle weakness. Muscle biopsies showed features of both nemaline myopathy and myofibrillar myopathy. We performed homozygosity mapping in both siblings using an Affymetrix 250K Nspl SNP array. One of the overlapping homozygous regions harbored the gene CFL2. Because a mutation in CFL2 was identified in a family with nemaline myopathy, we performed sequence analysis of the gene and a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 (c.19G&gt;A, p.Val7Met) of CFL2 was identified in both siblings. CFL2 encodes the protein cofilin-2, which plays an important role in regulation of sarcomeric actin filaments. To our knowledge, this is the second family in which a mutation in CFL2 causes an autosomal recessive form of congenital myopathy with features of both nemaline and myofibrillar myopathy. Given the clinical variability and the multitude of histological features of congenital myopathies, CFL2 sequence analysis should be considered in patients presenting with an autosomal recessive form of congenital myopathy.",

One hundred forty-four patients with early stage (cT1T2N0) OSCC were identified from a pre-existing database of patients with oral cancer. We examined the impact of the immunohistochemical expression of CD133, NANOG, and NOTCH1 in OSCC. Overall survival (OS) curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of outcome were identified using multivariate analysis. We found that CD133, NANOG, and NOTCH1 were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, and NOTCH1 was also significantly associated with depth of invasion and locoregional recurrence. NOTCH1 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for OS. NOTCH1 might prove to be a useful indicator for high-risk patients with occult metastases from early stage OSCC.",

The very first of these is lineage specification into the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) during mammalian preimplantation development. In mouse embryos, transcription factors (TFs) such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog are enriched in cells of ICM, which gives rise to the fetus and yolk sac. Conversely, TFs such as Cdx2 and Eomes become highly upregulated in TE, which contribute to the placenta.

The canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway is critical for maintaining CSCs characteristics. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a natural organosulfur compound from the garlic, exhibits effective antitumor properties. However, the role of DATS in regulating breast CSCs activity and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. In the present study, we reported that DATS efficiently inhibited the viability of breast CSCs as evidenced by reducing turmorspheres formation, decreasing the expression of breast CSCs markers (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, and Oct4), as well as inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that DATS downregulated the activity of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, while LiCl-triggered Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation diminished DATS inhibition on breast CSCs. Taken together, our results illustrated that DATS suppressed breast CSCs through inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation. These novel findings could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of breast CSCs regulation as well as its target intervention and might provide new strategies for preventing and treating breast cancers.",

Recently, Wharton's jelly (WJ) was proven as the best MSC source among various compartments of UC. However, it is still unclear whether or not Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) from different parts of the whole cord exhibit the same characteristics. There may be varied MSCs present in different parts of WJ throughout the length of the UC. For this purpose, using an explant attachment method, WJMSCs were isolated from three different parts of the UC, mainly present towards the placenta (mother part), the center of the whole cord (central part) and the part attached to the fetus (baby part). WJMSCs from all three parts were maintained in normal growth conditions (10% ADMEM) and analyzed for mesenchymal markers, pluripotent genes, proliferation rate and tri-lineage differentiation potential. All WJMSCs were highly proliferative, positively expressed CD90, CD105, CD73 and vimentin, while not expressing CD34, CD45, CD14, CD19 or HLA-DR, differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes and expressed pluripotency markers OCT-4, SOX-2 and NANOG at gene and protein levels. Furthermore, MSCs derived from all the parts were shown to have potency towards hepatocyte-like cell differentiation. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were used as a positive control. Finally, we conclude that WJMSCs derived from all the parts are valuable sources and can be efficiently used in various fields of regenerative medicine.",

Nanog is one of the transcription factors that are essential for stem cellular physiology process. Previous studies reported that Nanog was detected in breast cancer and other solid tumors and indicated that it has oncogenic characteristics. However, expression feature of Nanog in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) enriched population and its biological function in BCSCs is poorly understood. In this study, CD44 + CD24- fraction sorting with Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter and mammosphere culture were used for enriching BCSCs. We report here that Nanog was highly expressed in CSCs-enriched population from the breast cancer cells, as well as stemness-associated genes. In addition, we employed the lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting Nanog to investigate function of Nanog in BCSCs. We found that targeted inhibition of Nanog could suppress proliferation and colony formation in breast cancer cells. Further studies showed that targeted inhibition of Nanog resulted in a decrease of BCSCs activities, including mammosphere formation, CD44 + CD24- proportion and expressions of stemness-associated genes. These data therefore suggest that Nanog possesses important function in BCSCs and targeted inhibition of Nanog may provide a novel means of targeting and eliminating BCSCs.",

Though the elements regulating cellular states have been identified, the underlying dynamic mechanisms and the significance of such cellular heterogeneity remain elusive. We present a gene regulatory network model to investigate the bimodal Nanog distribution in stem cells. Our model reveals a novel role of dynamic conversion between the cellular states of high and low Nanog levels. Model simulations demonstrate that the low-Nanog state benefits cell differentiation through serving as an intermediate state to reduce the barrier of transition. Interestingly, the existence of low-Nanog state dynamically slows down the reprogramming process, and additional Nanog activation is found to be essential to quickly attaining the fully reprogrammed cell state. Nanog has been recognized as a critical pluripotency gene in stem cell regulation. Our modeling results quantitatively show a dual role of Nanog during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming, and the importance of the intermediate state during cell state transitions. Our approach offers a general method for analyzing key regulatory factors controlling cell differentiation and reprogramming.",

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the traditional use, phytochemistry, biological activity, cultivation, and extraction of Sideritis scardica and to highlight the gaps in our knowledge which deserves further research. The present review is based on information collected from scientific journals, books, and electronic search. These sources include Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google scholar as well as local books on ethnopharmacology and botany of this plant. The reported data on phytochemical studies, biological activity, cultivation, extraction, and traditional uses have been reviewed. Variability in essential oil composition of wild growing and cultivated taxa depending on ecological conditions was discussed. Flavonoids, phenylethanoids, diterpenoids, aliphatic compounds, etc. identified so far have been summarized. A comparative study on the effectiveness of different methods, solvents, and parameters of extraction has also been discussed. A broad range of activities of plant extracts and fractions as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, antioxidant, gastroprotective, antiglioma, and triple monoamine reuptake inhibition as well as cultivation of the species as an approach for conservation of the natural habitats and provision of herb with high and permanent quality has also been presented. Sideritis scardica has become very popular and widely advertised herb in Europe. Although some of ethnobotanical uses have been proved through in vitro experiments, further studies of the individual compounds or chemical class of compounds responsible for the pharmacological effects and the mechanisms of action are necessary. In addition, the toxicity and the side effects from the use of Sideritis scardica as well as clinical trails need attention. The variability in the chemical composition of this medicinal plant depending on the origin requires development of a protocol for its standardization. For the practice it is important to improve cultivation conditions in order to increase the accumulation of biologically active compounds and to obtain herb with permanent and good quality.",

Various symptoms have been reported for this abnormality such as short stature, unusual facial characteristics, congenital heart abnormalities, developmental complications, and an elevated tumor incidence rate. Noonan syndrome shares clinical features with other rare conditions, including LEOPARD syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair, and Costello syndrome. Germline mutations in the RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signal transduction pathway are responsible for NS and other related disorders. Noonan syndrome diagnosis is primarily based on clinical features, but molecular testing should be performed to confirm it in patients. Due to the high number of genes associated with NS and other RASopathy disorders, next-generation sequencing is the best choice for diagnostic testing. Patients with NS also have higher risk for leukemia and specific solid tumors. Age-specific guidelines for the management of NS are available.",

In this study, we diagnosed ten NS or NSML patients via targeted sequencing or whole exome sequencing (TS/WES). TS/WES was performed to identify mutations in ten Chinese patients who exhibited the following manifestations: potential facial dysmorphisms, short stature, congenital heart defects, and developmental delay. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the suspected pathological variants in the patients and their family members. TS/WES revealed three mutations in the PTPN11 gene, three mutations in RAF1 gene, and four mutations in BRAF gene in the NS and NSML patients who were previously diagnosed based on the abovementioned clinical features. All the identified mutations were determined to be de novo mutations. However, two patients who carried the same mutation in the RAF1 gene presented different clinical features. One patient with multiple lentigines was diagnosed with NSML, while the other patient without lentigines was diagnosed with NS. In addition, a patient who carried a hotspot mutation in the BRAF gene was diagnosed with NS instead of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFCS). TS/WES has emerged as a useful tool for definitive diagnosis and accurate genetic counseling of atypical cases. In this study, we analyzed ten Chinese patients diagnosed with NS and related disorders and identified their correspondingPTPN11, RAF1, and BRAF mutations. Among the target genes, BRAF showed the same degree of correlation with NS incidence as that of PTPN11 or RAF1.",

Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding molecules in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in SHOC2, p.S2G, has been identified as causative for a type of Noonan-like syndrome characterized by the presence of loose anagen hair. In order to understand the contribution of SHOC2 mutations to the clinical manifestations of Noonan syndrome and related disorders, we analyzed SHOC2 in 92 patients with Noonan syndrome and related disorders who did not exhibit PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/2, SOS1 or RAF1 mutations. We found the previously identified p.S2G mutation in eight of our patients. We developed a rapid detection system to identify the p.S2G mutation using melting curve analysis, which will be a useful tool to screen for the apparently common mutation. All the patients with the p.S2G mutation showed short stature, sparse hair and atopic skin. Six of the mutation-positive patients showed severe mental retardation and easily pluckable hair, and one showed leukocytosis. No SHOC2 mutations were identified in leukemia cells from 82 leukemia patients. These results suggest that clinical manifestations in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients partially overlap with those in patients with typical Noonan or CFC syndrome and show that easily pluckable/loose anagen hair is distinctive in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients.",

While the proportion of the two protamines is highly variable between different species, abnormal ratios within a species are known to be associated with male subfertility. Therefore, it is more than likely that correct protamine expression represents a kind of chromatin checkpoint during sperm development rendering protamines as suitable biomarkers for the estimation of sperm quality.

Previous evidence suggested that Crocus sativus is linked to improving cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The aim of this study was to in vitro and in vivo investigate the mechanism(s) by which Crocus sativus exerts its positive effect against AD. The effect of Crocus sativus extract on A\u03b2 load and related toxicity was evaluated. In vitro results showed that Crocus sativus extract increases the tightness of a cell-based blood-brain barrier (BBB) model and enhances transport of A\u03b2. Further in vivo studies confirmed the effect of Crocus sativus extract (50 mg/kg/day, added to mice diet) on the BBB tightness and function that was associated with reduced A\u03b2 load and related pathological changes in 5XFAD mice used as an AD model. Reduced A\u03b2 load could be explained, at least in part, by Crocus sativus extract effect to enhance A\u03b2 clearance pathways including BBB clearance, enzymatic degradation and ApoE clearance pathway. Furthermore, Crocus sativus extract upregulated synaptic proteins and reduced neuroinflammation associated with A\u03b2 pathology in the brains of 5XFAD mice. Crocin, a major active constituent of Crocus sativus and known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect, was also tested separately in vivo in 5XFAD mice. Crocin (10 mg/kg/day) was able to reduce A\u03b2 load but to a lesser extent when compared to Crocus sativus extract.

Fleas can be a major cause of pruritus in dogs and cats and also vectors of potentially zoonotic bacteria in the genera Rickettsia and Bartonella. Morphological examination of 174 fleas from dogs and cats living in Hong Kong revealed only cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis). Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1) genotyping of 20 randomly selected specimens, revealed three cox1 haplotypes (HK-h1 to HK-h3). The most common haplotype was HK-h1 with 17 specimens (17/20, 85%). HK-h1 was identical to cox1 sequences of fleas in Thailand and Fiji. HK-h1 and HK-h2 form a distinct cat flea cox1 clade previously recognized as the Clade 3. HK-h3 forms a new Clade 6. A multiplex Bartonella and Rickettsia real-time PCR of DNA from 20 C. felis found Bartonella and Rickettsia DNA in three (15%) and ten (50%) C. felis, respectively. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of R. felis, B. clarridgeiae and Bartonella henselae. This is the first reported study of that kind in Hong Kong, and further work is required to expand the survey of companion animals in the geographical region.

The objective of this study is to assess the presence and infection rate of Rickettsia species in cat fleas from selected endemic and nonendemic regions of California. Cat fleas were collected from cats in Los Angeles County (endemic region) and Sacramento and Contra Costa counties (nonendemic region). Sequencing of 17 amplicons confirmed the presence of R. felis in both the endemic and non-endemic regions with a calculated maximum likelihood estimation of 131 and 234 per 1000 fleas, respectively.

Two R. felis-like genotypes were also detected in fleas from Los Angeles County; Genotype 1 was detected in 1 flea pool and Genotype 2 was found in 10 flea pools. Genotype 1 was also detected in a single flea pool from Sacramento County. Results from this study show that R. felis is widespread in cat flea populations in both flea-borne rickettsioses endemic and nonendemic regions of California, suggesting that a high prevalence of this bacterium in cat fleas does not predispose to increased risk of human infection.

An endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase-2A, inhibitor-1, I1PP2A, which inhibits the phosphatase activity by interacting with its catalytic subunit protein phosphatase-2Ac, is known to be upregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. In the present study, we overexpressed I1PP2A by intracerebroventricular injection with adeno-associated virus vector-1-I1PP2A in Wistar rats.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28406466": "We suggest a novel method that uses artificial blood cells (hemoglobin vesicles, Hb-Vs) as photosensitizers in dye laser treatment (at 595-nm wavelength) for port-wine stains (i.e., capillary malformations presenting as red birthmarks) based on the results of animal experiments. As compared with human red blood cells, Hb-Vs have the same absorbance of 595 nm wavelength light and produce the same level of heat following dye laser irradiation. Small sized Hb-Vs (250 nm) distribute in the plasma phase in blood and tend to flow in the marginal zone of microvessels. Intravenous injections of Hb-Vs caused the dilatation of microvessels, and dye laser treatment with Hb-Vs destroyed the vessel wall effectively. Following the intravenous injection of Hb-Vs, the microvessels contained more Hb that absorbed laser photons and produced heat. This extra Hb tended to flow near the endothelial cells, which were the target of the laser treatment. These attributes of Hb-Vs will potentially contribute to enhancing the efficacy of dye laser treatment for port-wine stains. Hemoglobin is a type of porphyrin. Thus, our proposed treatment may have aspects of photodynamic therapy using porphyrin that leads to a cytotoxicity effect by active oxygen.",

The major anti-atherogenic function of HDL is to mediate reverse cholesterol transport. This response is highly dependent on apoA-I and apoE, protein components of HDL. Randomized clinical trials have assessed effects of several classes of drugs on plasma cholesterol levels in CAD patients. Agents including cholestyramine, fibrates, niacin, and statins significantly lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and induce modest increases in HDL-C, but tolerance issues and undesirable side effects are common. Additionally, residual risk may be present in patients with persistently low HDL-C and other complications despite a reduction in LDL-C. These observations have fueled interest in the development of new pharmacotherapies that positively impact circulating lipoproteins. The goal of this review is to discuss the therapeutic potential of synthetic apolipoprotein mimetic peptides. These include apoA-I mimetic peptides that have undergone initial clinical assessment. We also discuss newer apoE mimetics that mediate the clearance of atherogenic lipids from the circulation and possess anti-inflammatory properties. One of these (AEM-28) has recently been given orphan drug status and is undergoing clinical trials.",

Human infection occurs by the accidental ingestion of embryonated eggs present in the soil, vegetables or on other contaminated surfaces, as well as via consumption of uncooked paratenic hosts, such as bird meat and giblets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contamination of soil in public parks and playgrounds in Shiraz using microscopy and molecular methods. A total of 150 soil samples were collected from public parks and playgrounds in various areas of Shiraz, southern Iran. The samples were treated with saturated zinc sulphate solution, and Toxocara spp. eggs were detected by microscopic observation followed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To differentiate T. canis and T. cati eggs from each other, PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA region by SalI endonuclease enzyme was used. PCR-sequencing was performed to confirm the results of the PCR-RFLP method. Based on the flotation results of the 150 soil samples, six (4%) were found to be positive for Toxocara spp. eggs, whereas nested-PCR showed 24 samples to be positive (16%). Based on the PCR-RFLP method and the sequence of the ITS-rDNA region, a total of 23 out of 24 isolates were confirmed as T. cati and one out of 24 as T. canis. The results showed a higher number of soil samples to be positive for Toxocara by the molecular method than microscopy, and higher T. cati infection in soil samples, which could have an important role in human infection with toxocariasis in this region.",

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using T. canis excretory-secretory (TES) antigens harvested from T. canis larvae is currently the serological test for confirming toxocariasis. An alternative to producing large amounts of Toxocara TES and improved diagnosis for toxocariasis is through the development of highly specific recombinant antigens such as the T. canis second stage larva excretory-secretory 30 kDa protein (recTES-30). The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid diagnostic kit (RDT, named as iToxocara kit) in comparison to recTES-30 ELISA in Serendah Orang Asli village in Selangor, Malaysia. A total of 133 subjects were included in the study. The overall prevalence rates by ELISA and RDT were 29.3% and 33.1%, respectively, with more positive cases detected in males than females. However, no association was found between toxocariasis and gender or age. The percentage sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of RDT were 85.7%, 90.1%, 80% and 93.2%, respectively. The prevalence for toxocariasis in this population using both ELISA and RDT was 27.1% (36/133) and the K-concordance test suggested good agreement of the two tests with a Cohen's kappa of 0.722, P&lt;0.01. In addition, the followed-up Spearman rank correlation showed a moderately high correlation at R=0.704 and P&lt;0.01.

In paratenic hosts, larvae of these worms cause multiple organ damage. However, how these paratenic hosts response to these worms and whether any common biomarker can be applied for diagnosis are still unclear. Excreted/secreted (E/S) antigens were prepared by culture of <i>T. canis</i> larvae in vitro. Using a western blot (WB) assay the humoral IgG responses, induced by <i>Toxocara</i> spp. larvae to the worm's E/S antigens in different infected hosts including mice, rabbits and human, were examined. In a mouse model of toxocariasis, intraperitoneal injection of <i>T. canis</i> larvae induces inflammatory leukocyte accumulation in the liver and the lungs but not in the brain, although a remarkable number of larvae were detected in this organ. Mice and rabbits responded differently to <i>Toxocara</i> spp. resulting in distinct heterogenous WB band patterns. Mice and rabbits both responded to a 33.1 kDa E/S constituent that turned out to be the most sensitive protein for serodiagnosis. Sera from human toxocariasis patients showed heterogenous WB band patterns similar to those observed in rabbits and all responded to the 33.1 kDa band. 33.1 kDa E/S protein can be considered as a critical common biomarker for toxocariasis immuno-diagnosis in both paratenic animals and human and its specificity requires further investigation.",

Our study developed a method for distinguishing distant from recent human toxocariasis by assessing the avidity of the IgG antibodies. The avidity of specific antibodies increases with time after antigen challenge and assessment of the degree of avidity can be used to discriminate between recent and distant infections. The relative avidity was measured in 150 sera from children with visceral toxocariasis and in 46 sera from children with ocular toxocariasis. The probable time of infection was estimated on the basis of the medical history and clinical syndrome. Our study showed that 94.2% of positive sera collected from patients reporting infection &gt; 6 months ago had high IgG avidity values, confirming distant toxocariasis, whereas 25.9% of positive sera taken &lt; 6 months after infection showed low indices of IgG avidity. Our results suggest that measurement of the specific IgG avidity may assist in discriminating between recent and distant toxocariasis. The method can be used effectively to rule out (because of high avidity) a recently acquired infection. Low avidity is less reliable in discriminating between recent and distant infections.",

However, little is known about the effects and mechanisms of SST in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, a model of PD was generated by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats in order to investigate the effects of SST on LPS-induced degeneration of DA in vivo. Intramural injection of LPS resulted in a significant loss of DA neurons, while reduction of neuronal death by SST pretreatment was confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and Nissl. In parallel, immunohistochemical detection of OX-42 and hydroethidine staining were employed to determine the activation of microglia and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. It was found that SST inhibited the LPS-induced microglial activity and ROS production. ELISA revealed a decreased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 and prostaglandin E2 when SST was administered prior to LPS treatment. Western blot analysis showed that LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p-p65 was attenuated by administration of SST prior to LPS application. The results indicated that LPS-induced loss of nigral DA neurons was inhibited by SST and the observed effects of SST on neuroprotection were associated with suppression of microglial activation and the NF-\u03baB pathway, ensuing decreases of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The present study therefore suggested that SST is beneficial for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, through inhibiting the activation of microglia.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627166": "Somatostatin (SST) is abundantly produced by the human retina, and the main source is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). SST exerts relevant functions in the retina (neuromodulation, angiostatic, and anti-permeability actions) by interacting with SST receptors (SSTR) that are also expressed in the retina. In the diabetic retina, a downregulation of SST production does exist. In this article, we give an overview of the mechanisms by which this deficit of SST participates in the main pathogenic mechanisms involved in diabetic retinopathy (DR): neurodegeneration, neovascularization, and vascular leakage. In view of the relevant SST functions in the retina and the reduction of SST production in the diabetic eye, SST replacement has been proposed as a new target for treatment of DR. This could be implemented by intravitreous injections of SST analogs or gene therapy, but this is an aggressive route for the early stages of DR. Since topical administration of SST has been effective in preventing retinal neurodegeneration in STZ-induced diabetic rats, it seems reasonable to test this new approach in humans. In this regard, the results of the ongoing clinical trial EUROCONDOR will provide useful information. In conclusion, SST is a natural neuroprotective and antiangiogenic factor synthesized by the retina which is downregulated in the diabetic eye and, therefore, its replacement seems a rational approach for treating DR. However, clinical trials will be needed to establish the exact position of targeting SST in the treatment of this disabling complication of diabetes.",

However, the temporal profile by which OB somatostatin-expressing (Som+) interneurons are produced and the molecular mechanisms controlling this profile are totally unknown. In the present study, we found that all the Som+ interneurons in the mouse external plexiform layer (EPL) and the rat glomerular layer (GL) express the transcription factor Sp8.Using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) birth dating method, combined with immunostaining, we showed that the generation of Som+ interneurons in the mouse and rat OB is confined to the later embryonic and earlier postnatal stages. Within the mouse OB, the production of Som+ interneurons is maximal during late embryogenesis and decreases after birth, whereas the generation of Som+ interneurons is low during embryogenesis and increases gradually after birth in the rat OB. Interestingly, genetic ablation of Sp8 by cre/loxP-based recombination severely reduces the number of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp8 is required for the normal production of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB.",

We examined the middle (sheath) and lower (bulb) portions of the human HF using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), immunohistology, ELISA, in vitro coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and flow cytometry. We found that HF cells, relative to non-follicular epidermal cells, failed to promote allogeneic PBMC proliferation and CD4(+) and CD8(+) IFN\u03b3 production. By qPCR, we found significant downregulation of Class I and Class II HLA alleles in both the bulb and sheath, and upregulation of multiple immunoregulatory genes. It is noteworthy that somatostatin (SST) was significantly upregulated relative to epidermis. By immunohistochemistry, SST was most strongly expressed in the HF outer root sheath, and, by ELISA, cultured sheath cells secreted SST. PBMCs, cultured with stimulatory allogeneic epidermal cells and SST, secreted significantly less IFN\u03b3 than controls. Addition of SST antagonists to PBMCs cocultured with allogeneic HF cells increased IFN\u03b3 secretion. The data identify SST as a secretory factor potentially contributing to the HF IP repertoire.",

Batches of 10-15 islets were perifused and the hormones measured with RIA in 30-sec fractions. Increase of glucose from 3 to 20 mm resulted in a brief pulse of glucagon coinciding with suppression of basal insulin and somatostatin release. There was a subsequent drop of glucagon release concomitant with the appearance of a pronounced pulse of insulin and a slightly delayed pulse of somatostatin. Continued exposure to 20 mm glucose generated pulsatile release of the three hormones with 7- to 8-min periods accounting for 60-70% of the secreted amounts. Glucose caused pronounced stimulation of average insulin and somatostatin release. However, the nadirs between the glucagon pulses were lower than the secretion at 3 mm glucose, resulting in 18% suppression of average release. The repetitive glucagon pulses were antisynchronous to coincident pulses of insulin and somatostatin. The resulting greater than 20-fold variations of the insulin to glucagon ratio might be essential for minute-to-minute regulation of the hepatic glucose production.",

Research aim: This work has two main aims: evaluate the antibody profile of colostrum and study the quantitative variations in the antibodies' level and specific reactivity after undergoing Holder pasteurization. The authors focused on immunoregulatory components of colostrum (antidietary antibodies and TGF-\u03b22) in the neonatal gut. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 67 donated colostrum samples at different days after delivery, both raw and pasteurized. Antibody profiles were analyzed at different times during breastfeeding, and total and specific antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG subclasses) were compared with tetanus toxoid and ovalbumin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The processing effect on total and specific antibodies, as well as TGF-\u03b22, was evaluated by paired analyses. No variations in immunological compounds were observed throughout the colostrum stage. The TGF-\u03b22, antibodies' concentrations, and antibodies' specific reactivity after pasteurization did not vary significantly as days of lactation varied. Changes in antibody levels were dependent on isotype and IgG subclass, and IgG4 showed remarkable resistance to heating. Moreover, the effect of the pasteurization on specific reactivity was antigen dependent. The supply of relevant immunological components is stable throughout the colostrum stage. The effects of pasteurization on antibodies depend on isotype, subclass, and specificity.

Existing primary immunodeficiency registries are tailored to transplantation outcomes and do not capture the breadth of safety and efficacy endpoints required by the EMA for the long-term monitoring of gene therapies. Furthermore, for extended monitoring of Strimvelis, the young age of children treated, small patient numbers, and broad geographic distribution of patients all increase the risk of loss to follow-up before sufficient data have been collected. Establishing individual investigator sites would be impractical and uneconomical owing to the small number of patients from each location receiving Strimvelis. An observational registry has been established to monitor the safety and effectiveness of Strimvelis in up to 50 patients over a minimum of 15 years. To address the potential challenges highlighted above, data will be collected by a single investigator site at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), Milan, Italy, and entered into the registry via a central electronic platform. Patients/families and the patient's local physician will also be able to submit healthcare information directly to the registry using a uniquely designed electronic platform. Data entry will be monitored by a Gene Therapy Registry Centre (funded by GlaxoSmithKline) who will ensure that necessary information is collected and flows between OSR, the patient/family and the patient's local healthcare provider.

To enable analysis of the human surfaceome, we developed the surfaceome predictor SURFY, based on machine learning. As a training set, we used experimentally verified high-confidence cell-surface proteins from the Cell Surface Protein Atlas (CSPA) and trained a random forest classifier on 131 features per protein and, specifically, per topological domain. SURFY was used to predict a human surfaceome of 2,886 proteins with an accuracy of 93.5%, which shows excellent overlap with known cell-surface protein classes (i.e., receptors). In deposited mRNA data, we found that between 543 and 1,100 surfaceome genes were expressed in cancer cell lines and maximally 1,700 surfaceome genes were expressed in embryonic stem cells and derivative lines. Thus, the surfaceome diversity depends on cell type and appears to be more dynamic than the nonsurface proteome.

However, significant barriers remain for the translation of these vectors into widely available therapies. In particular, exposure to the AAV capsid can generate an immune response of neutralizing antibodies. One approach to overcome this response is to map the AAV-specific neutralizing epitopes and rationally design an AAV capsid able to evade neutralization. To accomplish this, we isolated a monoclonal antibody against AAV9 following immunization of BALB/c mice and hybridoma screening. This antibody, PAV9.1, is specific for intact AAV9 capsids and has a high neutralizing titer of &gt;1:160,000. We used cryo-electron microscopy to reconstruct PAV9.1 in complex with AAV9. We then mapped its epitope to the 3-fold axis of symmetry on the capsid, specifically to residues 496-NNN-498 and 588-QAQAQT-592. Capsid mutagenesis demonstrated that even a single amino acid substitution within this epitope markedly reduced binding and neutralization by PAV9.1. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> studies showed that mutations in the PAV9.1 epitope conferred a \"liver-detargeting\" phenotype to the mutant vectors, unlike AAV9, indicating that the residues involved in PAV9.1 interactions are also responsible for AAV9 tropism. However, we observed minimal changes in binding and neutralizing titer when we tested these mutant vectors for evasion of polyclonal sera from mice, macaques, or humans previously exposed to AAV. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the complexity of incorporating mapped neutralizing epitopes and previously identified functional motifs into the design of novel capsids able to evade immune response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Gene therapy utilizing viral vectors has experienced recent success, culminating in U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the first adeno-associated virus vector gene therapy product in the United States: Luxturna for inherited retinal dystrophy. However, application of this approach to other tissues faces significant barriers. One challenge is the immune response to viral infection or vector administration, precluding patients from receiving an initial or readministered dose of vector, respectively. Here, we mapped the epitope of a novel neutralizing antibody generated in response to this viral vector to design a next-generation capsid to evade immune responses. Epitope-based mutations in the capsid interfered with the binding and neutralizing ability of the antibody but not when tested against polyclonal samples from various sources. Our results suggest that targeted mutation of a greater breadth of neutralizing epitopes will be required to evade the repertoire of neutralizing antibodies responsible for blocking viral vector transduction.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576357": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in a variety of biological processes in diverse organisms, including mammals. In the mouse skeletal system, a global reduction of miRNAs in chondrocytes causes a lethal skeletal dysplasia. However, little is known about the physiological roles of individual miRNAs in chondrocytes. The miRNA-encoding gene, Mir140, is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates and is abundantly and almost exclusively expressed in chondrocytes. In this paper, we show that loss of Mir140 in mice causes growth defects of endochondral bones, resulting in dwarfism and craniofacial deformities. Endochondral bone development is mildly advanced due to accelerated hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in Mir140-null mice. Comparison of profiles of RNA associated with Argonaute 2 (Ago2) between wild-type and Mir140-null chondrocytes identified Dnpep as a Mir140 target. As expected, Dnpep expression was increased in Mir140-null chondrocytes. Dnpep overexpression showed a mild antagonistic effect on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling at a position downstream of Smad activation. Mir140-null chondrocytes showed lower-than-normal basal BMP signaling, which was reversed by Dnpep knockdown. These results demonstrate that Mir140 is essential for normal endochondral bone development and suggest that the reduced BMP signaling caused by Dnpep upregulation plays a causal role in the skeletal defects of Mir140-null mice.",

We recently determined that Axin2 and Runx2 molecularly interact in differentiating osteoblasts to regulate intramembranous bone formation, but the relationship between these factors in endochondral bone formation was unresolved. To address this, we examined the effects of Axin2 deficiency on the cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) phenotype of Runx2(+/-) mice, focusing on skeletal defects attributed to improper endochondral bone formation. Axin2 deficiency unexpectedly exacerbated calvarial components of the CCD phenotype in the Runx2(+/-) mice; the endocranial layer of the frontal suture, which develops by endochondral bone formation, failed to mineralize in Axin2(-/-):Runx2(+/-) mice, resulting in a cartilaginous, fibrotic and larger fontanel than observed in Runx2(+/-) mice. Transcripts associated with cartilage development (e.g., Acan, miR140) were expressed at higher levels, whereas blood vessel morphogenesis transcripts (e.g., Slit2) were suppressed in Axin2(-/-):Runx2(+/-) calvaria. Cartilage maturation was impaired, as primary chondrocytes from double mutant mice demonstrated delayed differentiation and produced less calcified matrix in vitro. The genetic dominance of Runx2 was also reflected during endochondral fracture repair, as both Runx2(+/-) and double mutant Axin2(-/-):Runx2(+/-) mice had enlarged fracture calluses at early stages of healing. However, by the end stages of fracture healing, double mutant animals diverged from the Runx2(+/-) mice, showing smaller calluses and increased torsional strength indicative of more rapid end stage bone formation as seen in the Axin2(-/-) mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate a dominant role for Runx2 in chondrocyte maturation, but implicate Axin2 as an important modulator of the terminal stages of endochondral bone formation.",

Recent studies had reported the protective role of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) against oxidative stress. Hence, we investigated the levels of miR140-5p and its functional role in the pathogenesis of Cisplatin induced AKI. A mice Cisplatin induced-AKI model was established. We found that miR-140-5p expression was markedly increased in mice kidney. Bioinformatics analysis revealed nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) was a potential target of miR-140-5p, We demonstrated that miR-140-5p did not affect Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) level but directly targeted the 3'-UTR of Nrf2 mRNA and played a positive role in the regulation of Nrf2 expression which was confirmed by luciferase activity assay and western blot. What was more, consistent with miR140-5p expression, the mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2, as well as antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven genes Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase l (NQO1) were significantly increased in mice kidney tissues. In vitro study, Enforced expression of miR-140-5p in HK2 cells significantly attenuated oxidative stress by decreasing ROS level and increasing the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Simultaneously, miR-140-5p decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and improved cell vitality in HK2 cells under Cisplatin-induced oxidative stress. However, HK2 cells transfected with a siRNA targeting Nrf2 abrogated the protective effects of miR-140-5p against oxidative stress. These results indicated that miR-140-5p might exert its anti-oxidative stress function via targeting Nrf2. Our findings showed the novel transcriptional role of miR140-5p in the expression of Nrf2 and miR-140-5p protected against Cisplatin induced oxidative stress by activating Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway, providing a potentially therapeutic target in acute kidney injury.",

We used mixed-design ANOVAs to test group differences, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to assess the discriminatory power of each measure, and Spearman correlation analyses to probe the association between measures. The largest area under the ROC curve was observed in salivary cortisone at 20 min after the end of the TSST (AUC = 0.909 \u00b1 0.044, p &lt; 0.0001). Significant time-by-group interactions were found in the parameters marked with * above, indicating stress-induced increases.

This systematic review primarily aims at assessing if balneotherapy, mud/peloid therapy, and spa therapy may influence cortisol levels. Secondarily, it aims at understanding if these interventions may improve stress resilience. PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles in English or Italian about studies involving healthy and sub-healthy subjects or patients with a diagnosed disease about effects of balneotherapy, mud/peloid therapy, and spa therapy on serum and salivary cortisol levels. Fifteen studies involving 684 subjects were included. Five studies investigated biological effects of balneotherapy alone. Two of them reported significant changes of cortisol levels in healthy participants. The other three studies reported no significant variations in patients with rheumatic conditions. No studies investigated biological effects of mud/peloid therapy alone. Ten studies investigated biological effects of spa therapy with or without included mud/peloid therapy, and in all but two studies, significant variations of cortisol levels were reported. Our main findings suggest that balneotherapy may have the potential to influence cortisol levels in healthy subjects, in such a way as to improve stress resilience. Spa therapy with or without included mud/peloid therapy demonstrated the same potential to influence cortisol levels also in sub-healthy subjects and in patients with a diagnosed disease. Therefore, balneotherapy and spa therapy may be considered as useful interventions for the management of stress conditions. Further investigation is needed because of limited available data.",

AD patients were also evaluated for general disease severity using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. The serum levels of TARC, total IgE, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were measured by laboratory tests. The Skindex-16 was used as a skin disease-specific, quality of life measure, instrument. The results showed that the saliva cortisol level was significantly higher in AD patients compared to healthy subjects (P &lt; 0.01). The salivary cortisol level was significantly correlated with the SCORAD index (r = 0.42, P &lt; 0.05) while the serum TARC and LDH levels were positively correlated with the SCORAD index.

The advantages of salivary measurements include only free hormone is detected, samples can be collected during normal daily routines and stress-induced cortisol release is less likely to occur than during venepuncture. We review the use of salivary biomarkers to diagnose and monitor patients for conditions of cortisol excess and deficiency and discuss the value of measuring salivary cortisone versus salivary cortisol. Developments in laboratory techniques have enabled the measurement of salivary hormones with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. In states of altered cortisol binding, salivary biomarkers are more accurate measures of adrenal reserve than serum cortisol. Salivary cortisone is a superior marker of serum cortisol compared with salivary cortisol, specifically when serum cortisol is low and during hydrocortisone therapy when contamination of saliva may result in misleading salivary cortisol concentrations. Salivary cortisol and cortisone can be used to assess cortisol excess, deficiency and hydrocortisone replacement, with salivary cortisone having the advantage of detection when serum cortisol levels are low and there is no interference from oral hydrocortisone.",

The diurnal rhythms of sputum IL-6, sputum TNF-\u03b1 and salivary cortisol were measured in lung cancer patients with and without depression as well as depressed controls and healthy controls. The area under the diurnal variation curves (AUC) over the 24h time course and relative diurnal variation (VAR) were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Patients with co-morbid depression and lung cancer showed highest level of sputum IL-6 AUC, sputum TNF-\u03b1 AUC and lowest level of cortisol VAR (P&lt;0.001). As a biomarker for depression, salivary cortisol VAR demonstrated an optimal cutoff point at 77.8% (AUC=0.94; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98), which is associated with a sensitivity of 82.1% and a specificity of 96.0%. Sputum IL-6 AUC demonstrated a sensitivity of 74.4% and a specificity of 92.0% (AUC=0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.90).

Salivary cortisol is often used as a noninvasive sampling method that possesses important health implications. A critical barrier to psychobiological research that involves salivary cortisol is a time delay of days to months before cortisol results are obtained via immunoassay, long after the person is no longer proximate to the social context in which they provided the sample. The present study was designed to address this critical barrier through creation of a lateral flow test (LFT) cortisol device capable of measuring salivary cortisol within minutes of sample collection. The LFT is frequently used within commercial point-of-care settings to obtain rapid answers to the presence/absence of a biomarker. The present study extends the LFT into the research domain by presenting performance characteristics of a quantitative LFT that measures salivary cortisol within 20 minutes of sample collection. Saliva samples from 29 adults (15 men) were obtained in the morning and afternoon by using Passive Drool and then the Super\u00b7SAL Extra Collection Device (hereafter Super\u00b7SAL) and later assayed with LFT and a commercially available enzyme immunoassay.

Salivary cortisol is a measure of active free cortisol and follows the diurnal rhythm of serum or plasma cortisol. The saliva sample may be collected by drooling or through the use of absorbent swabs which are placed into the mouth until saturated. Salivary cortisol is therefore convenient for patients and research participants to collect noninvasively on an outpatient basis. Several assay techniques have been used to measure salivary cortisol, including radioimmunoassay and more recently liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical sensitivity varies between these assay methods, as does the potential for cross-reactivity with other steroids. The interpretation of salivary cortisol levels relies on rigorous standardization of sampling equipment, sampling protocols and assay technology with establishment of a local reference range. Clinically, the commonest use for salivary cortisol is measuring late-night salivary cortisol as a screening test for Cushing's syndrome. Several studies have shown diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of over 90%, which compares very favourably with other screening tests for Cushing's syndrome such as the 24-h urinary-free cortisol and the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. There are emerging roles for the use of salivary cortisol in diagnosing adrenal insufficiency, particularly in conditions associated with low cortisol-binding globulin levels, and in the monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement.

Mechanistically, miR-25/93 targets NCOA3, an epigenetic factor that maintains basal levels of cGAS expression, leading to repression of cGAS during hypoxia. This allows hypoxic tumour cells to escape immunological responses induced by damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, specifically the release of mitochondrial DNA. Moreover, restoring cGAS expression results in an anti-tumour immune response. Clinically, decreased levels of cGAS are associated with poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer harbouring high levels of miR-25/93. Together, these data suggest that inactivation of the cGAS pathway plays a critical role in tumour progression, and reveal a direct link between hypoxia-responsive miRNAs and adaptive immune responses to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment, thus unveiling potential new therapeutic strategies.",

We report here the structure of cGAS with dinucleotides and small molecule inhibitors, and kinetic studies of the cGAS mechanism. Our structural work supports the understanding of how ds-DNA activates cGAS, suggesting a site for small molecule binders that may cause cGAS activation at physiological ATP concentrations, and an apparent hotspot for inhibitor binding. Mechanistic studies of cGAS provide the first kinetic constants for 2',3'-cGAMP formation, and interestingly, describe a catalytic mechanism where 2',3'-cGAMP may be a minor product of cGAS compared with linear nucleotides.",

Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates innate immune responses through production of the second messenger cGAMP, which activates the adaptor STING. The cGAS-STING pathway not only mediates protective immune defense against infection by a large variety of DNA-containing pathogens but also detects tumor-derived DNA and generates intrinsic antitumor immunity. However, aberrant activation of the cGAS pathway by self DNA can also lead to autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Thus, the cGAS pathway must be properly regulated. Here we review the recent advances in understanding of the cGAS-STING pathway, focusing on the regulatory mechanisms and roles of this pathway in heath and disease.",

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA virus, and the cGAS-STING pathway may inhibit HBV RNA synthesis and viral assembly in cell culture, but the exact roles of the cGAS pathway in the restriction of HBV replication in infection systems remain to be elucidated. In this study, replication of HBV was significantly inhibited both in cell culture and in vivo in a mouse model when the cGAS-STING pathway was activated by dsDNA or cGAMP. In contrast, the presence of enzymatically inactive cGAS mutant did not influence HBV replication. Moreover, knockdown of cGAS in human peripheral blood monocytes led to a higher level of intracellular HBV DNA.

Moreover, little is known about how cell-fate determinants are regulated in functionally important subnetworks in large gene-regulatory networks (i.e., GRN motifs). Here we propose a model of stem cell differentiation in which cell-fate determinants work synergistically to determine different cellular identities, and reside in a class of GRN motifs known as feedback loops. Based on this model, we develop a computational method that can systematically predict cell-fate determinants and their GRN motifs. The method was able to recapitulate experimentally validated cell-fate determinants, and validation of two predicted cell-fate determinants confirmed that overexpression of ESR1 and RUNX2 in mouse neural stem cells induces neuronal and astrocyte differentiation, respectively.

Current guidelines do not recommend universal screening for depression in adults, unless staff supports are in place to diagnose, treat, and follow up patients. Reported screening rates ranged from 33% to 84% among women. Several validated screening tools for depression exist; however, their performance among this population is unknown. Screening in high-risk populations may improve the patient's receipt of diagnosis and treatment. Effective treatments include exercise, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy.

They are composed of three subunits, TcA, TcB and TcC. TcA forms the translocation channel and the TcB-TcC heterodimer functions as a cocoon that shields the toxic enzyme. Binding of the cocoon to the channel triggers opening of the cocoon and translocation of the toxic enzyme into the channel. Here we show in atomic detail how the assembly of the three components activates the toxin. We find that part of the cocoon completely unfolds and refolds into an alternative conformation upon binding. The presence of the toxic enzyme inside the cocoon is essential for its subnanomolar binding affinity for the TcA subunit. The enzyme passes through a narrow negatively charged constriction site inside the cocoon, probably acting as an extruder that releases the unfolded protein with its C terminus first into the translocation channel.",

In the insect pathogen Photorhabdus, tc genes encode high molecular weight insecticidal toxins with oral activity against caterpillar pests. One protein, TcdA, has recently been expressed in transgenic plants and shown to confer insect resistance. These toxins therefore represent alternatives to toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for deployment in transgenic crops. Levels of TcdA expression in transgenic plants were, however, low and the full toxicity associated with the native toxin was not reconstituted. Here we show that increased activity of the toxin TcdA1 requires potentiation by either of two pairs of gene products, TcdB1 and TccC1 or TcdB2 and TccC3. Moreover, these same pairs of proteins can also cross-potentiate a second toxin, TcaA1B1. To elucidate the likely functional domains present in these large proteins, we expressed fragments of each 'toxin' or 'potentiator' gene within mammalian cells. Several domains produced abnormal cellular morphologies leading to cell death, while others showed specific phenotypes such as nuclear translocation. Our results prove that the Tc toxins are complex proteins with multiple functional domains. They also show that both toxin genes and their potentiator pairs will need to be expressed to reconstitute full activity in insect-resistant transgenic plants.

The toxins are composed of different components that form oligomers for biological activity. Lipid bilayer experiments were performed with the TcdA1 component of the Tc toxin from Photorhabdus luminescens, which preferentially kills insects by actin polymerization. TcdA1 was able to increase the specific conductance of artificial lipid bilayer membranes by the formation of ion-permeable channels. The channels had on average a single-channel conductance of 125 pS in 150 mM KCl and were found to be cation selective. The single-channel conductance of the TcdA1-channels was only moderately dependent on the bulk aqueous KCl concentration, which indicated point-charge effects on the channel properties. Experiments to study the voltage dependence of the TcdA1 channel demonstrated that it is reconstituted in a fully oriented way when it is added to only one side of the lipid bilayer membrane. A combination of biologically active components (TccC3) and a possible chaperone (TcdB2) blocked the TcdA1-mediated conductance efficiently in a dose-dependent manner when they were added to the cis side of the membrane.

Herein, we further explore the potential signaling cascades associated with this anti-TGEV activity in ST cells. Ouabain, a representative cardenolide, was found to potently diminish TGEV titers and inhibit the TGEV-induced production of IL-6 in a dose dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 37 nM and 23 nM respectively. By pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing, we demonstrated that PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling was induced in TGEV-infected ST cells, and ouabain imparted a degree of anti-TGEV activity via further augmentation of this existing PI3K_PDK1 axis signaling, in a manner dependent upon its association with the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Finally, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or PDK1 by BX795 antagonized the anti-viral activity of ouabain and restored the TGEV virus titer and yields. This finding is the first report of a PI3K_PDK1 signaling axis further induced by ouabain and implicated in the suppression of TGEV activity and replication; greatly illuminates the underlying mechanism of cardenolide toxicity; and is expected to result in one or more anti-viral applications for the cardenolides in the future.",

We grew 16 of 21 known Pachypodium spp. and quantified putative cardenolides by HPLC and also by inhibition of animal Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase (the physiological target of cardiac glycosides) using an in vitro assay. Pachypodium extracts were tested against monarch caterpillars in a feeding bioassay. We also tested four Asclepias spp. and five Pachypodium spp. extracts, contrasting inhibition of the cardenolide-sensitive porcine Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase to the monarch's resistant form. We found evidence for low cardenolides by HPLC, but substantial toxicity when extracts were assayed on Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPases. Toxicity showed phylogenetic signal, and taller species showed greater toxicity (this was marginal after phylogenetic correction). Application of Pachypodium extracts to milkweed leaves reduced monarch growth, and this was predicted by inhibition of the sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase in phylogenetic analyses. Asclepias extracts were 100-fold less potent against the monarch compared to the porcine Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase, but this difference was absent for Pachypodium extracts. Pachypodium contains potent toxicity capable of inhibiting sensitive and cardenolide-adapted Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPases.

However, how chronic alcohol consumption causes hepatic lipid accumulation remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a causal role in alcoholic steatosis, inflammation, and liver injury. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to hyperactivation of mTORC1, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream kinase S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in hepatocytes. Aberrant activation of mTORC1 was likely attributed to the defects of the DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the liver of chronic-plus-binge ethanol-fed mice and in the liver of patients with ALD. Conversely, adenoviral overexpression of hepatic DEPTOR suppressed mTORC1 signaling and ameliorated alcoholic hepatosteatosis, inflammation, and acute-on-chronic liver injury. Mechanistically, the lipid-lowering effect of hepatic DEPTOR was attributable to decreased proteolytic processing, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). DEPTOR-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 also attenuated alcohol-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of the lipogenic regulator lipin 1 and prevented alcohol-mediated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Pharmacological intervention with rapamycin alleviated the ability of alcohol to up-regulate lipogenesis, to down-regulate fatty acid oxidation, and to induce steatogenic phenotypes. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to activation of SREBP-1 and lipin 1 through S6K1-dependent and independent mechanisms. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1 disrupted DEPTOR function, enhanced mTORC1 activity, and exacerbated alcoholic fatty liver, inflammation, and liver injury in mice. The dysregulation of SIRT1-DEPTOR-mTORC1 signaling is a critical determinant of ALD pathology; targeting SIRT1 and DEPTOR and selectively inhibiting mTORC1-S6K1 signaling may have therapeutic potential for treating ALD in humans.

In Drosophila, stellate-shaped tracheal terminal cells make seamless tubes, with single branches running through each of dozens of cellular extensions. We find that mutations in braided impair terminal cell branching and cause formation of seamless tube cysts. We show that braided encodes Syntaxin7 and that cysts also form in cells deficient for other genes required either for membrane scission (shibire) or for early endosome formation (Rab5, Vps45, and Rabenosyn-5). These data define a requirement for early endocytosis in shaping seamless tube lumens. Importantly, apical proteins Crumbs and phospho-Moesin accumulate to aberrantly high levels in braided terminal cells. Overexpression of either Crumbs or phosphomimetic Moesin induced lumenal cysts and decreased terminal branching. Conversely, the braided seamless tube cyst phenotype was suppressed by mutations in crumbs or Moesin. Indeed, mutations in Moesin dominantly suppressed seamless tube cyst formation and restored terminal branching. We propose that early endocytosis maintains normal steady-state levels of Crumbs, which recruits apical phosphorylated (active) Moe, which in turn regulates seamless tube shape through modulation of cortical actin filaments.",

How their epithelial features, such as apicobasal polarity or adhesion, are maintained and remodelled and how adhesion and polarity proteins contribute to morphogenesis are two important questions in development. Here, we approach these issues by investigating the role of the apical determinant protein Crumbs (Crb) during the morphogenesis of the embryonic Drosophila tracheal system. Crb accumulates differentially throughout tracheal development and is required for different tracheal events. The earliest requirement for Crb is for tracheal invagination, which is preceded by an enhanced accumulation of Crb in the invagination domain. There, Crb, acting in parallel with the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway, is required for tracheal cell apical constriction and for organising an actomyosin complex, which we propose is mediated by Crb recruitment of moesin (Moe). The ability of a Crb isoform unable to rescue polarity in crb mutants to otherwise rescue their invagination phenotype, and the converse inability of a FERM-binding domain mutant Crb to rescue faulty invagination, support our hypothesis that it is the absence of Crb-dependent Moe enrichment, and not the polarity defect, that mainly underlies the crb invagination phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the phenotype of lethal giant larvae (lgl); crb double mutants. These results unveil a link between Crb and the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenesis.",

However, the collagen turnover rate during life is not clear, and it is debated whether osteoarthritis (OA) can influence it. Using the carbon-14 ((14)C) bomb-pulse method, life-long replacement rates of collagen were measured in tibial plateau cartilage from 23 persons born between 1935 and1997 (15 and 8 persons with OA and healthy cartilage, respectively). The (14)C levels observed in cartilage collagen showed that, virtually, no replacement of the collagen matrix happened after skeletal maturity and that neither OA nor tissue damage, per se, influenced collagen turnover. Regional differences in (14)C content across the joint surface showed that cartilage collagen located centrally on the joint surface is formed several years earlier than collagen located peripherally. The collagen matrix of human articular cartilage is an essentially permanent structure that has no significant turnover in adults, even with the occurrence of disease.",

To determine the extent to which these interactions are important in maintaining the integrity of ageing articular cartilage, we analyzed an age range of normal healthy articular cartilage samples by Western blotting, immunohistochemical, and PCR analyses. Reduced levels of type IX collagen were detected in post adolescence cartilage. Type IX collagen epitopes were evident throughout the matrix in all cartilage samples up to 19 years of age. Post adolescence, however, the pattern of immunoreactivity revealed territorial staining only. Type IX collagen expression at the transcriptional level is maintained at all ages. Type IX collagen fragments were extracted from young tissue, supporting the hypothesis that young cartilage is continually remodelled, while mature cartilage maintains relatively low levels of collagen turnover. Clearly the age changes we observed may have significant effects on the integrity of the tissue as the chondrocytes in ageing articular cartilage have limited capacity to turnover the interterritorial matrix. However, this study provides evidence that even in old age, the chondrocyte attempts to maintain its pericellular environment and hence its mechanical role. Therefore, the potential of type IX collagen to interact with other matrix components continues to be of importance in the territorial environment, and these interactions may have significant roles in mechanotransduction.",

Circulating levels rise in the preprandial phase, suggesting an anticipatory or cephalic phase of release, and decline in the postprandial phase, suggesting either the loss of a stimulatory factor or inhibition by factors released when nutrients enter the intestine. We hypothesized that vagal signals are not required for the (i) preprandial increase or (ii) postprandial suppression of ghrelin levels. Further, we wanted to investigate the hypothesis that (iii) glucagon-like peptide-1 might be implicated in the postprandial decline in ghrelin levels. We measured ghrelin levels in plasma from sham-feeding and meal studies carried out in vagotomized individuals and controls, and from a GLP-1 infusion study carried out in fasting healthy young individuals. We find that (i) ghrelin secretion is unchanged during indirect vagal stimulation as elicited by modified sham-feeding in vagotomized individuals and matched controls, (ii) ghrelin secretion is similarly suppressed after meal ingestion in vagotomized individuals and controls, and (iii) infusion of GLP-1 does not lower ghrelin levels.

Resected stomach specimens from 20 MO patients undergoing SG were analyzed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction of ghrelin mRNA and immunohistostaining for ghrelin cells in three stomach regions (fundus, body, and pre-antral areas) were performed. Body mass index (BMI) and total plasma ghrelin levels were obtained before and 3 months postoperatively.

We have reported previously that central or peripheral administration of ghrelin stimulates food intake, and the secretion of GH and gastric acid in rats. In the present study, we investigated how much endogenous centrally released ghrelin is involved in the control of food intake and body weight gain. We also examined the profile of ghrelin secretion from the stomach by RIA using two kinds of anti-ghrelin antiserum, one raised against the N-terminal ([Cys(12)]-ghrelin[1-11]) region and one raised against the C-terminal ([Cys(0)]-ghrelin [13-28]) region of the peptide. The former antibody recognizes specifically ghrelin with n- octanoylated Ser 3 (acyl ghrelin), and does not recognize des-acyl ghrelin. The latter also recognizes des-acyl ghrelin (i.e. total ghrelin). Intracerebroventricular treatment with the anti-ghrelin antiserum against the N-terminal region twice a day for 5 days decreased significantly both daily food intake and body weight. Des-acyl ghrelin levels were significantly higher in the gastric vein than in the trunk. Either fasting for 12 h, administration of gastrin or cholecystokinin resulted in increase of both acyl and des-acyl ghrelin levels. The ghrelin levels exhibited a diurnal pattern, with the bimodal peaks occurring before dark and light periods. These two peaks were consistent with maximum and minimum volumes of gastric content respectively. These results suggest that (1) endogenous centrally released ghrelin participates in the regulation of food intake and body weight, (2) acyl ghrelin is secreted from the stomach, (3) intestinal hormones stimulate ghrelin release from the stomach, and (4) regulation of the diurnal rhythm of ghrelin is complex, since ghrelin secretion is augmented under conditions of both gastric emptying and filling.",

Acyl-ghrelin, which binds to and activates the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a), is considered to be the active form for its orexigenic effects. It has been demonstrated that peripheral administration of ghrelin stimulates food intake and adiposity in rodents and humans. Accordingly, different approaches to antagonize ghrelin/GHS-R1a signaling have been pursued for the treatment of obesity. In the present study, we generated and characterized high-affinity anti-acyl ghrelin-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In vitro, the lead mAb (33A) displayed specific binding to acyl-ghrelin, with an estimated K(d) value &lt; 100 pM. In recombinant receptor cell-based assays, 33A dose-dependently inhibited the ghrelin-mediated calcium signal, with an IC(50) of approximately 3.5 nM. In vivo, ghrelin dose-dependently stimulated food intake in mice, and this effect was fully blocked by a single injection of 33A. In a 4-week chronic study, 33A was shown to effectively bind to endogenous acyl-ghrelin; however, long-term administration of 33A did not affect food intake or body weight gain in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Our results indicate that peripheral neutralization of ghrelin can suppress appetite stimulated by a transient surge in ghrelin levels. The lack of long-term effects on body weight control by 33A suggests that compensatory mechanisms may contribute to the regulation of energy balance.",

Ghrelin also plays an essential role in the mechanism of gastric mucosal defense. Thus, it is important to clarify which diseases primarily influence changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations. Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is involved in the pathogenesis of gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H pylori eradication is related to body weight change. Compared, H pylori infected and negative subjects with normal body mass index, plasma ghrelin concentration, gastric ghrelin mRNA, and the number of ghrelin producing cells in gastric mucosa are significantly lower in H pylori infected subjects than in H pylori-negative controls. Plasma ghrelin concentration decreases with the progression of gastric atrophy. Impaired gastric ghrelin production in association with atrophic gastritis induced by H pylori infection accounts for the decrease in plasma ghrelin concentration. However, the ratio of plasma acylated ghrelin to total ghrelin levels is higher in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis than in healthy subjects. This may result from the compensatory increase in plasma active ghrelin concentration in response to gastric atrophy. After H pylori eradication, gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression is increased nearly 4-fold in most cases. However, changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations before and after H pylori cure are not associated with the gastric ghrelin production. Plasma ghrelin changes are inversely correlated with both body weight change and initial plasma ghrelin levels.",

However, several issues concerning the role of ghrelin in physiological and pathophysiological processes are still under investigation. Most of the ghrelin produced in the body is secreted in the stomach, but it is also expressed in the hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreas, intestine, kidney, heart and gonads. Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion via growth hormone secretagogue receptors. Ghrelin secretion in the stomach depends on both acute and chronic changes in nutritional status and energy balance. Current data support the hypothesis that the stomach, in addition to its important role in digestion, not only influences pituitary hormone secretion but, via ghrelin production, it also sends orexigenic (appetite increasing) signals to hypothalamic nuclei involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. In addition to these main effects, ghrelin influences insulin secretion and glucose metabolism and it may exert potentially important effects on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal functions. Because of its effects on a large number of physiological functions, ghrelin may be involved in the pathomechanism of several human disorders, including disturbances of appetite, energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Further research might lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of ghrelin and might provide more effective therapy for the above disorders.",

Anthropometric measurements were assessed and mean weight gain was calculated. Serum ghrelin concentrations have been determined at least 3 hours after feeding by radioimmunoassay test.

To investigate sex differences in the action of ghrelin, we assessed the effects of exogenous ghrelin in intact male and female rats, the effects of exogenous ghrelin in ovariectomized (OVX) and estradiol (E2)-treated female rats, as well as the effects of OVX on plasma ghrelin and hypothalamic orexigneic neuropeptide expression in rats and on food intake and weight gain in transgenic mice lacking the ghrelin receptor (Ghsr(-/-) mice). Male and OVX female rats were significantly more sensitive than intact female rats to the orexigenic effects of both centrally (intra-third ventricular, i3vt, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 nmol) and systemically (ip, 3, 6, and 9 nmol) administered ghrelin. This difference is likely to be estradiol dependent because E2 attenuated the orexigenic action of ghrelin in OVX female and male rats. Furthermore, OVX increased food intake and body weight in wild-type mice, but not in Ghsr(-/-) mice, suggesting that OVX increases food intake by releasing ghrelin from a tonic inhibitory effect of estradiol. In addition, following OVX, there was an increase in plasma ghrelin that was temporally associated with increased food intake, body weight, and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and Agouti-related protein mRNA expression. Collectively, these data suggest that estradiol inhibits the orexigenic action of ghrelin in females, that weight gain associated with OVX is ghrelin mediated, and that this endocrine interaction may account for an important sex differences in food intake and the regulation of body weight.",

Plasma ghrelin levels increase during fasting and decrease after ingesting glucose and lipid, but not protein. The efferent vagus nerve contributes to the fasting-induced increase in ghrelin secretion. Ghrelin secreted by the stomach stimulates the afferent vagus nerve and promotes food intake. Ghrelin also stimulates pituitary gland secretion of growth hormone (GH) via the afferent vagus nerve. GH inhibits stomach ghrelin secretion. These findings indicate that the vagal circuit between the central nervous system and stomach has a crucial role in regulating plasma ghrelin levels. Moreover, body mass index modulates plasma ghrelin levels. In a lean state and anorexia nervosa, plasma ghrelin levels are increased, whereas in obesity, except in Prader-Willi syndrome, plasma ghrelin levels are decreased and the feeding- and sleeping-induced decline in plasma ghrelin levels is disrupted. There are two forms of ghrelin: active n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin. Fasting increases both ghrelin types compared with the fed state. Hyperphagia and obesity are likely to decrease plasma des-acyl ghrelin, but not n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin levels. Hypothalamic serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 and serotonin 5-HT2C/1B receptor gene expression levels are likely to be proportional to plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels during fasting, whereas they are likely to be inversely proportional to plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in an increased energy storage state such as obesity. Thus, a dysfunction of the ghrelin feedback systems might contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity and eating disorders.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27376422": "Ghrelin is a gut peptide composed of 28 amino acids mostly secreted in the gastric fundus mucosa. It was isolated and described in 1999 by Kojima et al. and only three years later its specific receptor, GHSR1a, was also identified. Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor, is the only peripheral orexigenic hormone that activates the receptors to be found especially in the appetite center (hypothalamus and pituitary gland). Ghrelin is present in human plasma in two forms: an inactive form known as deacylated ghrelin, and an active form called acylated ghrelin synthesized under the action of ghrelin O-acyltransferase enzyme (GOAT). The literature even mentions an extremely complex ghrelin/GOAT/GHSR system involved in the regulation of human energy, metabolism and adaptation of energy homeostasis to environmental changes. In humans, there is a preprandial rise and a postprandial fall in plasma ghrelin levels, which strongly suggest that the peptide plays a physiological role in meal initiation and may be employed in determining the amount and quality of ingested food. Besides the stimulation of food intake, ghrelin determines a decrease in energy expenditure and promotes the storage of fatty acids in adipocytes. Thus, in the human body ghrelin induces a positive energy balance, an increased adiposity gain, as well as an increase in caloric storage, seen as an adaptive mechanism to caloric restriction conditions. In the current world context, when we are witnessing an increasing availability of food and a reduction of energy expenditure to a minimum level, these mechanisms have become pathogenic. As a consequence, the hypothesis that ghrelin is involved in the current obesity epidemic has been embraced by many scholars and researchers.",

Leptin and ghrelin central effects are mediated, at least partly, through the neuropeptide Y/Y1 receptor pathway in the hypothalamus. We determined whether ghrelin is also present in the fetus and investigated its relationship to leptin, growth hormone, birth weight, and calf and abdominal circumferences in 90 full-term neonates. Immunoreactive ghrelin was detected in all cord samples (mean +/- SD, 187 +/- 88 pmol/L; range, 66-594 pmol/L). In contrast to leptin, ghrelin concentrations of boys and girls were not statistically different. In female neonates, ghrelin is inversely correlated with anthropometric measures. In male neonates, ghrelin is positively correlated with leptin and negatively with growth hormone. The presence of significant ghrelin concentrations in all neonates before the first feeding is intriguing. Unlike the fairly constant concentrations and effects of leptin over the short term, the wide variability of ghrelin concentrations observed in newborns raises the possibility that ghrelin secretion causes short-term changes in feeding behavior. We suggest that ghrelin may play a physiologic role in the initiation of feeding.",

This phospholipid elicits a wide range of cancer cell responses, such as proliferation, trans-differentiation, migration, and invasion, via various G-protein-coupled LPA receptors (LPARs). Here, we explored the cellular signaling pathway via which LPA induces migration of ovarian cancer cells. LPA induced robust phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, which are membrane-cytoskeleton linkers, in the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3. Among the LPAR subtypes expressed in these cells, LPA<sub>1</sub> and LPA<sub>2</sub>, but not LPA<sub>3</sub>, induced phosphorylation of ERM proteins at their C-termini. This phosphorylation was dependent on the G\u03b1<sub>12/13</sub>/RhoA pathway, but not on the G\u03b1<sub>q</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC or G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>/adenylate cyclase/PKA pathway. The activated ERM proteins mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and formation of membrane protrusions in OVCAR-3 cells. Importantly, LPA-induced migration of OVCAR-3 cells was completely abolished not only by gene silencing of LPA<sub>1</sub> or LPA<sub>2</sub>, but also by overexpression of a dominant negative ezrin mutant (ezrin-T567A). Taken together, this study demonstrates that the LPA<sub>1</sub>/LPA<sub>2</sub>/ERM pathway mediates LPA-induced migration of ovarian cancer cells. These findings may provide a potential therapeutic target to prevent metastatic progression of ovarian cancer.",

Firstly, we describe findings demonstrating that the distribution of P-gp along the small intestine is heterogeneous, which explains why orally administered P-gp substrate drugs often show bimodal changes of plasma concentration. Secondly, we discuss the post-translational regulation of P-gp localization and function by the scaffold proteins ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM proteins), together with recent reports indicating that tissue-specific differences in regulation by ERM proteins in normal tissues might be retained in corresponding cancerous tissues. Thirdly, we review evidence that P-gp activity is enhanced in the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with cancer progression, without any increase in expression of P-gp mRNA. Finally, we describe two examples in which P-gp critically influences the brain distribution of drugs, i.e., oseltamivir, where low levels of P-gp associated with early development allow oseltamivir to enter the brain, potentially resulting in neuropsychiatric side effects in children, and cilnidipine, where impairment of P-gp function in ischemia allows cilnidipine to enter the ischemic brain, where it exerts a neuroprotective action.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777033": "Leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) is absolutely fundamental to the inflammatory response, and involves initial pseudopod protrusion and subsequent polarised migration across inflamed endothelium. Ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins are expressed in leukocytes and mediate cell shape changes and polarity. The spatio-temporal organisation of ERM proteins with their targets, and their individual contribution to protrusion during TEM, has never been explored. Here, we show that blocking binding of moesin to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) reduces its C-terminal phosphorylation during monocyte TEM, and that on-off cycling of ERM activity is essential for pseudopod protrusion into the subendothelial space. Reactivation of ERM proteins within transmigrated pseudopods re-establishes their binding to targets, such as L-selectin. Knockdown of ezrin, but not moesin, severely impaired the recruitment of monocytes to activated endothelial monolayers under flow, suggesting that this protein plays a unique role in the early recruitment process. Ezrin binds preferentially to L-selectin in resting cells and during early TEM. The moesin-L-selectin interaction increases within transmigrated pseudopods as TEM proceeds, facilitating localised L-selectin ectodomain shedding. In contrast, a non-cleavable L-selectin mutant binds selectively to ezrin, driving multi-pseudopodial extensions. Taken together, these results show that ezrin and moesin play mutually exclusive roles in modulating L-selectin signalling and shedding to control protrusion dynamics and polarity during monocyte TEM.",

Consequently, this research has already led to the first FDA approved drugs that exploit the gained knowledge to combat disease.

Leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are the most studied adipokines which play important roles in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis. Leptin and adiponectin mediate both proatherogenic and antiatherogenic responses. Leptin and adiponectin have been linked to the development of coronary heart disease and may be involved in the underlying biological mechanism of ischemic stroke. Resistin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is predictive of atherosclerosis and poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke. The changes in serum levels of novel adipokines apelin, visfatin are also associated with acute ischemic stroke. These adipokines have been proposed as potential prognostic biomarkers of cardiovascular mortality/morbidity and therapeutic targets in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. In this article, we summarize the biologic role of the adipokines and discuss the link between dysfunctional adipose tissue and metabolic/inflammation imbalance, consequently endothelial damage, progression of atherosclerotic disease, and the occurrence of ischemic stroke.",

Its expression in rodents was reported to be elevated or suppressed in genetic and diet-induced obesity, respectively. Resistin treatment impaired glucose tolerance and insulin action. Immunoneutralization of resistin improved insulin sensitivity, while thiazolidinedione treatment reduced resistin expression. Therefore, resistin could play a critical role in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study were determined resistin plasma levels in humans suffering from type 1 and type 2 diabetes and in healthy controls. Plasma levels of resistin in healthy controls were 38.78 ng/ml. They were not statistically different in individuals with a broad BMI range. Resistin plasma levels in type 2 diabetes were 38.7 ng/ml, and 39.4 ng/ml in type 1 diabetes. Thiazolidinedione treatment did not influence resistin plasma levels.

A comparison of this cDNA variant and genomic sequences indicates the lack of the second exon containing the secretory consensus signal. Both cDNAs, resistin and S-resistin, were carboxy-tagged with FLAG epitope and transiently expressed in cultured cell lines.

It can be regulated by sexual hormones. Whether environmental estrogens regulate the production of resistin is still not clear. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that octylphenol upregulated resistin mRNA expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. The concentration of octylphenol that increased resistin mRNA levels by 50% was approximately 100 nM within 6 h of treatment. The basal half-life of resistin mRNA induced by actinomycin D was lengthened by octylphenol treatment, suggesting that octylphenol decreases the rate of resistin mRNA degradation. In addition, octylphenol stimulated resistin protein expression and release. The basal half-life of resistin protein induced by cycloheximide was lengthened by octylphenol treatment, suggesting that octylphenol decreases the rate of resistin protein degradation. While octylphenol was shown to increase activities of the estrogen receptor (ER) and MEK1, signaling was demonstrated to be blocked by pretreatment with either ICI-182780 (an ERalpha antagonist) or U-0126 (a MEK1 inhibitor), in which both inhibitors prevented octylphenol-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK. These results imply that ERalpha and ERK are necessary for the octylphenol stimulation of resistin mRNA expression. Moreover, U-0126 antagonized the octylphenol-increased resistin protein expression and release. These data suggest that the way octylphenol signaling increases resistin protein levels is similar to that by which it increases resistin mRNA levels; it is likely mediated through an ERK-dependent pathway. In vivo, octylphenol increased adipose resistin mRNA expression and serum resistin and glucose levels, supporting its in vitro effect.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate resistin levels in OA joints and to determine if it is associated with inflammatory and catabolic factors in the joints. SF, plasma, and cartilage samples were collected from 88 OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. Resistin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in SF, plasma, and cartilage culture media. Significant levels of resistin [0.75 (0.67) ng/mL; median (IQR)] were found in SF from OA patients. Resistin correlated positively with interleukin (IL)-6 (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001) and with matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 (r = 0.31, p = 0.004) and MMP-3 (r = 0.24, p = 0.024) in SF.

In addition, resistin levels in plasma correlated positively with those in SF (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in SF or plasma resistin concentrations between females and males or between non-diabetic and diabetic patients, and resistin did not correlate with body mass index (BMI).

However, the molecular mechanism by which resistin acts is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether resistin could stimulate invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Here, we report that resistin stimulated invasion and migration of breast cancer cells as well as phosphorylation of c-Src. Inhibition of c-Src blocked resistin-induced breast cancer cell invasion. Resistin increased intracellular calcium concentration, and chelation of intracellular calcium blocked resistin-mediated activation of Src. Resistin also induced phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Inhibition of c-Src blocked resistin-mediated PP2A phosphorylation. In addition, resistin increased phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1. Inhibition of PP2A enhanced resistin-induced PKC\u03b1 phosphorylation, demonstrating that PP2A activity is critical for PKC\u03b1 phosphorylation. Resistin also increased phosphorylation of ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM). Additionally, ezrin interacted with PKC\u03b1, and resistin promoted co-localization of ezrin and PKC\u03b1. Either inhibition of c-Src and PKC\u03b1 or knock-down of ezrin blocked resistin-induced breast cancer cells invasion. Moreover, resistin increased expression of vimentin, a key molecule for cancer cell invasion. Knock-down of ezrin abrogated resistin-induced vimentin expression.

The aims of this study were to determine the effects of glucose and meal loading on serum resistin and total and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin in humans and to explore potential determinants of fasting serum resistin and of changes in resistin. Serum resistin and total and HMW adiponectin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in young, lean, nondiabetic subjects during 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and meal tolerance test (MTT). Resistin single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -420 was typed. Serum resistin was decreased at 60 and 120 minutes during OGTT compared with baseline (n = 36, 1-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, P &lt; .0001; Scheffe, P = .0457 and P &lt; .0001, respectively). Serum resistin was also reduced at 240 minutes during MTT (n = 33, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, P &lt; .0001; Scheffe, P = .0002). Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index revealed that the reductions in serum resistin were dependent on baseline resistin levels. Subjects with greater baseline concentrations of resistin experienced more pronounced declines in resistin (OGTT, unstandardized regression coefficient (beta) = -0.19, P = .0005; MTT, beta = -0.63, P &lt; .0001).

In agreement with a role of resistin in insulin resistance, the administration of recombinant resistin led to glucose intolerance in mice and impaired insulin action in rat liver. However, the regulation of resistin expression by physiological conditions, hormones, or agents known to modulate insulin sensitivity does not always support the association between resistin and obesity-induced insulin resistance. In the present study we investigated the effects of leptin administration on adipose resistin expression in insulin-resistant and obese ob/ob mice. We show that the expression of resistin mRNA and protein in adipose tissue is lower in ob/ob than in wild-type control mice, in agreement with the reduced adipocyte resistin mRNA level reported in several models of obesity. Leptin administration in ob/ob mice resulted in improvement of insulin sensitivity concomitant with a decrease in resistin gene expression. The lack of effect of leptin on resistin in db/db mice indicated that the leptin inhibitory action on resistin expression requires the long leptin receptor isoform. In addition, we demonstrated that the effect of leptin on resistin expression was centrally mediated. High-fat feeding in C57BL/6J wild-type mice, which is known to induce the development of obesity and insulin resistance, produced an increase in resistin expression. Interestingly, in both ob/ob and high fat-fed mice we obtained a striking positive correlation between glycemia and resistin gene expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that leptin decreases resistin expression and suggest that resistin may influence glucose homeostasis.",

We have previously reported that diabetic hearts express high levels of resistin while overexpression of resistin in adult rat hearts gives rise to a phenotype resembling diabetic cardiomyopathy. The transcriptional regulation of resistin in diabetic cardiac tissue is currently unknown. This study investigated the mechanism of resistin upregulation and the role of Serca2a in its transcriptional suppression. We demonstrate that restoration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in diabetic hearts, through normalization of Serca2a function genetically and pharmacologically, suppressed resistin expression via inhibition of NFATc. H9c2 myocytes stimulated with high-glucose concentration or Ca<sup>2+</sup> time-dependently increased NFATc and resistin expression while addition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM attenuated this effect. NFATc expression was enhanced in hearts from ob/ob diabetic and from cardiac-specific Serca2a<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Similarly, NFATc increased resistin expression in myocytes cultured in low glucose while the NFATc inhibitor VIVIT blocked glucose-induced resistin expression, suggesting that hyperglycemia/diabetes induces resistin expression possibly through NFATc activation. Interestingly, overexpression of Serca2a or VIVIT mitigated glucose-stimulated resistin and NFATc expression and enhanced AMPK activity, a downstream target of resistin signaling. NFATc direct activation of resistin was verified by resistin promoter luciferase activity and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis. Interestingly, activation of Serca2a by a novel agonist, CDN1163, mirrored the effects of AAV9-Serca2a gene transfer on resistin expression and its promoter activity and AMPK signaling in diabetic mice. These findings parse a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in resistin transactivation and provide support that manipulation of Serca2a-NFATc-Resistin axis might be useful in hyper-resistinemic conditions.",

The level of resistin was measured in paired synovial fluid (SF) and serum samples from patients following joint injury (anterior cruciate ligament, ACL or meniscus tear). Localization of resistin was visualized by immunohistochemistry of synovial tissue and cartilage from healthy and OA donors. Mouse and human cartilage cultures were used to assess the effect of resistin on cartilage metabolism. In trauma patients, resistin levels declined with increasing time post injury. The resistin levels were highest in samples collected up to 1 week following traumatic injury (SF: 2980 pg/ml, serum: 7901 pg/ml) and lowest in samples collected 6-26 years post injury (SF: 686 pg/ml, serum: 5682 pg/ml). Resistin was shown to be expressed in macrophage-like cells in both healthy and OA synovial tissue. Treatment of mouse cartilage cultures with recombinant resistin led to a dose dependent loss of proteoglycan and induction of inflammatory cytokine and PGE(2) production. Recombinant resistin inhibited proteoglycan synthesis in human cartilage explants. Resistin is elevated both systemically and locally in the weeks immediately following joint injury and has a direct effect on cartilage matrix turnover and cytokine production. Resistin may play a role in the early stages of trauma-induced OA and may represent a new therapeutic target to slow joint destruction in OA.",

Recent clinical studies have connected elevated resistin levels with the development and severity of heart failure. To further our understanding of the role of human resistin in heart failure, we studied a humanized mouse model lacking murine resistin but transgenic for the human Retn gene (Hum-Retn mice), which exhibits basal and inflammation-stimulated resistin levels similar to humans. Specifically, we explored whether resistin underlies acute anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Remarkably, doxorubicin (25mg/kg ip) led to a 4-fold induction of serum resistin levels in Hum-Retn mice. Moreover, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was greater in the Hum-Retn mice than in littermate controls not expressing human resistin (Retn(-/-)). Hum-Retn mice showed increased cardiac mRNA levels of inflammatory and cell adhesion genes compared with Retn(-/-) mice. Macrophages, but not cardiomyocytes, from Hum-Retn mice treated with doxorubicin in vitro showed dramatic induction of hRetn (human resistin) mRNA and protein expression. We also examined resistin levels in anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients with and without cardiotoxicity. Intriguingly, serum resistin levels in women undergoing anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increased significantly at 3 months and remained elevated at 6 months in those with subsequent cardiotoxicity. Further, elevation in resistin correlated with decline in ejection fraction in these women. These results suggest that elevated resistin is a biomarker of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and may contribute in the development of heart failure via its direct effects on macrophages. These results further implicate resistin as a link between inflammation, metabolism, and heart disease.",

A ligand for Toll-like receptor 4, resistin modulates the recruitment and activation of myeloid cells, notably neutrophils. Neutrophils are major drivers of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, in part due to the release of human neutrophil elastase- and myeloperoxidase-rich primary granules, leading to tissue damage. Here we assessed the relationship of resistin to CF lung disease. Resistin levels were measured in plasma and sputum from three retrospective CF cohorts spanning a wide range of disease. We also assessed the ability of neutrophils to secrete resistin upon activation in vitro. Finally, we constructed a multivariate model assessing the relationship between resistin levels and lung function. Plasma resistin levels were only marginally higher in CF than in healthy control subjects. By contrast, sputum resistin levels were very high in CF, reaching 50-100 fold higher levels than in plasma. Among CF patients, higher plasma resistin levels were associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and higher sputum resistin levels were associated with CF-related diabetes. Mechanistically, in vitro release of neutrophil primary granules was concomitant with resistin secretion. Overall, sputum resistin levels were negatively correlated with CF lung function, independently of other variables (age, sex, and genotype). Our data establish relationships between resistin levels in the plasma and sputum of CF patients that correlate with disease status, and identify resistin as a novel mechanistic link between neutrophilic inflammation and lung disease in CF.",

Its putative role as a mediator of insulin resistance is controversial. We hypothesized that resistin, like leptin, would have multiple roles in non-adipose tissues and we reported that resistin is expressed in mouse brain and pituitary. Moreover, resistin expression in female mouse pituitary is developmentally regulated and maximal expression occurs peripubertally. Although the role of endogenous resistin in mouse brain and pituitary has not been determined, our data suggest that resistin could be important in the postnatal maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary system. In the present study we compared the ontogeny of resistin gene expression in the pituitary of male and female mice using semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We show that resistin expression is developmentally regulated in the pituitary of male and female CD1 mice. However, significant gender differences were evident (male &gt; female at postnatal day 28 and 42) and this was not modified by neonatal treatment of female pups with testosterone. Since resistin expression in adipose tissue is also influenced by obesity, we evaluated resistin expression in fat, brain and pituitary of the obese ob/ob mouse. Resistin mRNA was significantly increased in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots in postnatal day 28 ob/ob mice compared to controls, but pituitary resistin expression was significantly reduced. In contrast to the prepubertal levels, and in agreement with other reports, adipose resistin expression was reduced in adult ob/ob mice. In a third set of experiments we examined the influence of food deprivation on pituitary and fat resistin mRNA. Resistin gene expression was severely down-regulated by a 24-hour fast in adipose and pituitary tissue but not in hypothalamus. In conclusion, pituitary resistin expression is age- and gender-dependent. In ob/ob mice, and in fasted mice, resistin is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Thus in visceral fat obesity increases but starvation decreases resistin mRNA. In contrast, pituitary levels are decreased in the presence of both high (ob/ob) and low (fasting) adipose stores. Further studies are required to define the unexpected hormonal regulation of resistin gene expression in the pituitary.",

PIM-1 expression levels in 4 pairs of ACC tissues and corresponding normal salivary gland tissues were determined by western blot analysis. PIM-1, FOXO3a, BAD and BCL-2 expression levels in 60 ACC tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay was performed to detect the apoptosis status of ACC tissues. PIM-1 was revealed to be highly expressed in ACC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. IHC staining results demonstrated high expression ratios of PIM-1, FOXO3a, BCL-2 and BAD [33.33% (20/60), 51.67% (31/60), 51.67% (31/60) and 55% (33/60)], respectively, and significant correlations between the expression of PIM-1 and FOXO3a and BCL-2 (P&lt;0.05). Apoptotic rates were significantly associated with PIM-1, FOXO3a, BCL-2 and BAD expression levels (P&lt;0.05). PIM-1 expression levels were significantly associated with tumor size, lymph node involvement, nerve invasion, distant metastasis and weakly associated with tumor node metastasis stage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that PIM-1 expression level was significantly associated with disease-free survival of patients with ACC (P=0.009). Cox regression multivariate analysis results revealed that histotype, distant metastasis and apoptotic rate were independent prognosis factors for ACC. Assessment of PIM-1 may be useful in investigating the malignant behaviors of ACC and predicting the outcome of patients with ACC.",

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvPim1 shared a close evolutionary relationship with Pim1 from vertebrates. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that LvPim1 was widely expressed in all tissues tested; with its transcript level induced in hepatopancreas and hemocytes upon challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptoccocus iniae, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), thus, suggesting its probable involvement in shrimp immune response. Moreover, knockdown of LvPim1 resulted in increased hemocytes apoptosis; shown by high caspase3/7 activity, coupled with increase in pro-apoptotic LvCaspase3 and LvCytochrome C, and decrease in pro-survival LvBcl2, LvIAP1, and LvIAP2 mRNA expression in hemocytes. Finally, LvPim1 knockdown renders shrimps more susceptible to V. parahaemolyticus infection. Taken together, our present data strongly suggest that LvPim1 is involved in modulating shrimp resistance to pathogen infection, promote hemocytes survival, and therefore plays a role in shrimp immune response.",

Cofilin-2 (Cfl2) was identified as one of the potential targets of miR-301a using prediction databases, which we validated by luciferase assay and mutation of predicted binding sites. Furthermore, expression of miR-301a contrastingly regulated Cfl2 expression levels in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCM). Along these lines, Cfl2 was significantly upregulated in Cs1-ko mice, indicating the physiological association between miR-301a and Cfl2 in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that Cfl2 activated serum response factor response element (SRF-RE) driven luciferase activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and in C2C12 cells. Similarly, knockdown of miR301a activated, whereas, its overexpression inhibited the SRF-RE driven luciferase activity, further strengthening physiological interaction between miR-301a and Cfl2. Interestingly, the expression of SRF and its target genes was strikingly increased in Cs1-ko suggesting a possible in vivo correlation between expression levels of Cfl2/miR-301a and SRF activation, which needs to be independently validated. In summary, our data demonstrates that miR-301a regulates Cofilin-2 in vitro in NRVCM, and in vivo in Cs1-ko mice. Our findings provide an additional and important layer of Cfl2 regulation, which we believe has an extended role in cardiac signal transduction and dilated cardiomyopathy presumably due to the reported involvement of Cfl2 in these mechanisms.",

Mammals express several ADF/cofilin isoforms, but their specific biochemical activities and cellular functions have not been studied in detail. Here, we demonstrate that the muscle-specific isoform cofilin-2 promotes actin filament disassembly in sarcomeres to control the precise length of thin filaments in the contractile apparatus. In contrast to other isoforms, cofilin-2 efficiently binds and disassembles both ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin filaments. We mapped surface-exposed cofilin-2-specific residues required for ATP-actin binding and propose that these residues function as an \"actin nucleotide-state sensor\" among ADF/cofilins. The results suggest that cofilin-2 evolved specific biochemical and cellular properties that allow it to control actin dynamics in sarcomeres, where filament pointed ends may contain a mixture of ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin subunits. Our findings also offer a rationale for why cofilin-2 mutations in humans lead to myopathies.",

A replacement of residues near the \u03b2-turn altered the spindle-shape to a cylindrical morphology of the gas vesicles. Vac<sup>-</sup> transformants were also obtained with alanine substitutions of charged residues of helix \u03b11 suggesting that these amino acids form salt-bridges with another GvpA monomer.

Gas vesicles increase the buoyancy of cells and enable them to migrate vertically in the water body to regions with optimal conditions. Their synthesis depends on environmental factors, such as light, oxygen supply, temperature and salt concentration. Fourteen gas vesicle protein (gvp) genes are involved in their formation, and regulation of gvp gene expression occurs at the level of transcription, including the two regulatory proteins, GvpD and GvpE, but also at the level of translation. The gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, GvpA and GvpC, and seven additional accessory proteins are also involved. Except for GvpI and GvpH, all of these are required to form the gas permeable wall.

This work combines state-of-the-art computational methods to develop a model for the major gas vesicle protein, GvpA, and explore its structure within the assembled vesicle. Elucidating this protein's structure has been challenging due to its adherent and aggregative nature, which has so far precluded in-depth biochemical analyses. Moreover, GvpA has extremely low similarity with any known protein structure, which renders homology modeling methods ineffective. Thus, alternate approaches were used to model its tertiary structure. Starting with the sequence from haloarchaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we performed ab initio modeling and threading to acquire a multitude of structure decoys, which were equilibrated and ranked using molecular dynamics and mechanics, respectively. The highest ranked predictions exhibited an \u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b2-\u03b1 secondary structure in agreement with earlier experimental findings, as well as with our own secondary structure predictions. Afterwards, GvpA subunits were docked in a quasi-periodic arrangement to investigate the assembly of the vesicle wall and to conduct simulations of contact-mode atomic force microscopy imaging, which allowed us to reconcile the structure predictions with the available experimental data. Finally, the GvpA structure for two representative organisms, Anabaena flos-aquae and Calothrix sp. PCC 7601, was also predicted, which reproduced the major features of our GvpA model, supporting the expectation that homologous GvpA sequences synthesized by different organisms should exhibit similar structures.",

The use of neurofeedback training is a popular method of improving the effectiveness BCI operation. The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent it is possible to improve the effectiveness of operation of sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interfaces (SMR-BCI) by supplementing user training with elements modifying the characteristics of visual feedback. Four experimental groups had training designed to reinforce BCI control by: visual feedback in the form of dummy faces expressing emotions (Group 1); flashing the principal elements of visual feedback (Group 2) and giving both visual feedbacks in one condition (Group 3). The fourth group participated in training with no modifications (Group 4). Training consisted of a series of trials where the subjects directed a ball into a basket located to the right or left side of the screen. In Group 1 a schematic image a face, placed on the controlled object, showed various emotions, depending on the accuracy of control. In Group 2, the cue and targets were flashed with different frequency (4 Hz) than the remaining elements visible on the monitor. Both modifications were also used simultaneously in Group 3. SMR activity during the task was recorded before and after the training. In Group 3 there was a significant improvement in SMR control, compared to subjects in Group 2 and 4 (control). Differences between subjects in Groups 1, 2 and 4 (control) were insignificant. This means that relatively small changes in the training procedure may significantly impact the effectiveness of BCI control. Analysis of behavioural data acquired from all participants at training showed greater effectiveness in directing the object towards the right side of the screen. Subjects with the greatest improvement in SMR control showed a significantly lower difference in the accuracy of rightward and leftward movement than others.",

Here, we studied the immediate and therapeutic effects of BCI-based training to control pre-movement sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) amplitude on robot-assisted finger extension in people with stroke. Eight people with moderate to severe hand impairment due to chronic stroke completed a four-week three-phase protocol during which they practiced finger extension with assistance from the FINGER robotic exoskeleton. In Phase 1, we identified spatiospectral SMR features for each person that correlated with the intent to extend the index and/or middle finger(s). In Phase 2, the participants learned to increase or decrease SMR features given visual feedback, without movement. In Phase 3, the participants were cued to increase or decrease their SMR features, and when successful, were then cued to immediately attempt to extend the finger(s) with robot assistance. Of the four participants that achieved SMR control in Phase 2, three initiated finger extensions with a reduced reaction time after decreasing (versus increasing) pre-movement SMR amplitude during Phase 3. Two also extended at least one of their fingers more forcefully after decreasing pre-movement SMR amplitude. Hand function, measured by the box and block test (BBT), improved by 7.3 \u00b1 7.5 blocks versus 3.5 \u00b1 3.1 blocks in those with and without SMR control, respectively. Higher BBT scores at baseline correlated with a larger change in BBT score.

These results merit further investigation in a rehabilitation context.",

Especially for BCIs based on the modulation of the Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) these improvements are essential, since a not negligible percentage of users is unable to operate SMR-BCIs efficiently. In this study we evaluated for the first time a fully automatic co-adaptive BCI system on a large scale. A pool of 168 participants naive to BCIs operated the co-adaptive SMR-BCI in one single session. Different psychological interventions were performed prior the BCI session in order to investigate how motor coordination training and relaxation could influence BCI performance. A neurophysiological indicator based on the Power Spectral Density (PSD) was extracted by the recording of few minutes of resting state brain activity and tested as predictor of BCI performances. Results show that high accuracies in operating the BCI could be reached by the majority of the participants before the end of the session. BCI performances could be significantly predicted by the neurophysiological indicator, consolidating the validity of the model previously developed. Anyway, we still found about 22% of users with performance significantly lower than the threshold of efficient BCI control at the end of the session. Being the inter-subject variability still the major problem of BCI technology, we pointed out crucial issues for those who did not achieve sufficient control.

In a recent study, we predicted SMR-BCI performance from psychological variables that were assessed prior to the BCI sessions and BCI control was supported with machine-learning techniques. We described two significant psychological predictors, namely the visuo-motor coordination ability and the ability to concentrate on the task. The purpose of the current study was to replicate these results thereby validating these predictors within a neurofeedback based SMR-BCI that involved no machine learning.Thirty-three healthy BCI novices participated in a calibration session and three further neurofeedback training sessions. Two variables were related with mean SMR-BCI performance: (1) a measure for the accuracy of fine motor skills, i.e., a trade for a person's visuo-motor control ability; and (2) subject's \"attentional impulsivity\". In a linear regression they accounted for almost 20% in variance of SMR-BCI performance, but predictor (1) failed significance. Nevertheless, on the basis of our prior regression model for sensorimotor control ability we could predict current SMR-BCI performance with an average prediction error of M = 12.07%. In more than 50% of the participants, the prediction error was smaller than 10%. Hence, psychological variables played a moderate role in predicting SMR-BCI performance in a neurofeedback approach that involved no machine learning.

This failure of the BCI system to read the intention of the user is one of the greatest problems and challenges in BCI research. There are two main causes for this problem in SMR-based BCI systems: either no idle SMR is observed over motor areas of the user, or this idle rhythm is not modulated during motor imagery, resulting in a classification performance lower than 70% (criterion level) that renders the control of a BCI application (like a speller) difficult or impossible. Previously, we introduced the concept of machine learning based co-adaptive calibration, which provided substantially improved performance for a variety of users.

Online performance varied strongly across users and sessions (median accuracy (%) of end-users: A=.65; B=.60; C=.47; D=.77). Our results thus yielded low to medium effectiveness in three end-users and high effectiveness in one end-user. Consequently, ITR was low (0.05-1.44bits/min). Only two end-users were able to play the game in free-mode. Total workload was moderate but varied strongly across sessions. Main sources of workload were mental and temporal demand. Furthermore, frustration contributed to the subjective workload of two end-users. Nevertheless, most end-users accepted the BCI application well and rated satisfaction medium to high. Sources for dissatisfaction were (1) electrode gel and cap, (2) low effectiveness, (3) time-consuming adjustment and (4) not easy-to-use BCI equipment.

The aim of this study was to gain insights into the effects of SMR-based BCI training on the cortical spectral activity associated with the performance of different mental imagery tasks. Linear cortical estimation and statistical brain mapping techniques were applied on high-density EEG data acquired from 18 healthy participants performing three different mental imagery tasks.

Cortical activation maps obtained for trained and naive subjects indicated different spectral and spatial activity patterns in response to the mental imagery tasks. Long-term effects of the previous SMR-based BCI training were observed on the motor cortical spectral activity specific to the BCI trained motor imagery task (simple hand movements) and partially generalized to more complex motor imagery task (playing tennis). Differently, mental imagery with spatial attention and memory content could elicit recognizable cortical spectral activity even in subjects completely naive to (BCI) training.

However, the detailed mechanism by which the TRAF6 RING dimer promotes ubiquitin transfer was unknown. Through structural modeling and biochemical analysis, we here show that the TRAF6 RING dimer employs a concerted allosteric mechanism using both subunits of the TRAF6 dimer to promote ubiquitin (Ub) transfer. In particular, we reveal the importance of the C-terminal extension of the TRAF6 RING domain that mediates <i>trans</i>-interactions with the donor-Ub. By analyzing structures and models of E3s in complex with Ub-loaded ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), we further highlight the roles of N-terminal and C-terminal extensions beyond the bona fide RING domains in promoting Ub transfer through engagement with a donor-Ub in <i>cis</i> and <i>in trans</i>, respectively.",

Here we describe a new family of E3 ligases that encodes a RING-H2 domain related in sequence to the ATL and BTL RING-H2 domains. This family, named CTL, encodes a motif designed as YEELL that expands 21 amino acids next to the RING-H2 domain that is present across most eukaryotic lineages. E3 ubiquitin ligase BIG BROTHER is a plant CTL that regulates organ size, and SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF111/ARKADIA is a vertebrate CTL. Basal animal and vertebrate, as well as fungi species, encode a single CTL gene that constraints the number of paralogs observed in vertebrates. Conversely, as previously described in ATL and BTL families in plants, CTL genes range from a single copy in green algae and 3 to 5 copies in basal species to 9 to 35 copies in angiosperms. Our analysis describes key structural features of a novel family of E3 ubiquitin ligases as an integral component of the set of core eukaryotic genes.",

The UHRF1 C-terminal RING finger functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase to establish histone H3 ubiquitination at Lys18 and/or Lys23, which is subsequently recognized by DNMT1 to promote its localization onto replication foci. Here, we present the crystal structure of DNMT1 RFTS domain in complex with ubiquitin and highlight a unique ubiquitin binding mode for the RFTS domain. We provide evidence that UHRF1 N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) also binds directly to DNMT1. Despite sharing a high degree of structural similarity, UHRF1 UBL and ubiquitin bind to DNMT1 in a very distinct fashion and exert different impacts on DNMT1 enzymatic activity. We further show that the UHRF1 UBL-mediated interaction between UHRF1 and DNMT1, and the binding of DNMT1 to ubiquitinated histone H3 that is catalyzed by UHRF1 RING domain are critical for the proper subnuclear localization of DNMT1 and maintenance of DNA methylation. Collectively, our study adds another layer of complexity to the regulatory mechanism of DNMT1 activation by UHRF1 and supports that individual domains of UHRF1 participate and act in concert to maintain DNA methylation patterns.",

The activity of p53 is mainly controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. However, the regulation of Mdm2 remains not well understood. Here, we show that MARCH7, a RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, physically interacts with Mdm2 and is essential for maintaining the stability of Mdm2. MARCH7 catalyzes Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked polyubiquitination of Mdm2, which impedes Mdm2 autoubiquitination and degradation, thereby leading to the stabilization of Mdm2. MARCH7 also promotes Mdm2-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation of p53. Furthermore, MARCH7 is able to regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and tumorigenesis via a p53-dependent mechanism. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for the regulation of Mdm2 and reveal MARCH7 as an important regulator of the Mdm2-p53 pathway.",

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the SINA gene family has six members, and we characterize in this study all tomato SINA (SlSINA) genes and the gene products. Our results show that SlSINA genes are differentially regulated in leaf, bud, stem, flower, and root. All SlSINA proteins possess RING-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, exhibiting similar specificity towards the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. SlSINA1/3/4/5/6 are localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas SlSINA2 is exclusively localized in the nucleus. Moreover, all SlSINAs can interact with each other for homo- or hetero-dimerization. The functionality of SlSINA proteins has been investigated. SlSINA4 plays a positive role in defense signalling, as manifested by elicitation of E3-dependent hypersensitive response-like cell death; the other SlSINAs are negative regulator and capable to suppress hypersensitive response cell death. Transgenic tomato plants overexpressing SlSINA2 exhibit pale-green leaf phenotype, suggesting SlSINA2 regulates chlorophyll level in plant cells, whereas transgenic tomato plants overexpressing SlSINA5 have altered floral structure with exserted stigma, implicating SlSINA5 plays a role in flower development.",

The BRCA1 RING domain is a ubiquitin ligase, whose structure and function rely critically on forming a heterodimer with BARD1, which also harbors a RING domain. The function of the BARD1 RING domain is unknown. In families severely affected with breast cancer, we identified inherited BARD1 missense mutations Cys53Trp, Cys71Tyr, and Cys83Arg that alter three zinc-binding residues of the BARD1 RING domain. Each of these mutant BARD1 proteins retained the ability to form heterodimeric complexes with BRCA1 to make an active ubiquitin ligase, but the mutant BRCA1/BARD1 complexes were deficient in binding to nucleosomes and in ubiquitylating histone H2A. The BARD1 mutations also caused loss of transcriptional repression of BRCA1-regulated estrogen metabolism genes <i>CYP1A1</i> and <i>CYP3A4</i>; breast epithelial cells edited to create heterozygous loss of <i>BARD1</i> showed significantly higher expression of <i>CYP1A1</i> and <i>CYP3A4</i> Reintroduction of wild-type <i>BARD1</i> into these cells restored <i>CYP1A1</i> and <i>CYP3A4</i> transcription to normal levels, but introduction of the cancer-predisposing <i>BARD1</i> RING mutants failed to do so. These results indicate that an intact BARD1 RING domain is critical to BRCA1/BARD1 binding to nucleosomes and hence to ubiquitylation of histone H2A and also critical to transcriptional repression of BRCA1-regulated genes active in estrogen metabolism.",

Human FAAH gene mutations are associated with increased body weight and obesity. In our present study, using targeted metabolite and lipid profiling, and new global acetylome profiling methodologies, we examined the role of the liver on fuel and energy homeostasis in whole body FAAH(-/-) mice. FAAH(-/-) mice exhibit altered energy homeostasis demonstrated by decreased oxygen consumption (Indirect calorimetry). FAAH(-/-) mice are hyperinsulinemic and have adipose, skeletal and hepatic insulin resistance as indicated by stable isotope phenotyping (SIPHEN). Fed state skeletal muscle and liver triglyceride levels was increased 2-3 fold, while glycogen was decreased 42% and 57% respectively. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis was decreased 22% in FAAH(-/-) mice. Dysregulated hepatic FAAH(-/-) lysine acetylation was consistent with their metabolite profiling. Fasted to fed increases in hepatic FAAH(-/-) acetyl-CoA (85%, p&lt;0.01) corresponded to similar increases in citrate levels (45%). Altered FAAH(-/-) mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) acetylation, which can affect the malate aspartate shuttle, was consistent with our observation of a 25% decrease in fed malate and aspartate levels. Decreased fasted but not fed dihydroxyacetone-P and glycerol-3-P levels in FAAH(-/-) mice was consistent with a compensating contribution from decreased acetylation of fed FAAH(-/-) aldolase B. Fed FAAH(-/-) alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) acetylation was also decreased. Whole body FAAH deletion contributes to a pre-diabetic phenotype by mechanisms resulting in impairment of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. FAAH(-/-) mice had altered hepatic lysine acetylation, the pattern sharing similarities with acetylation changes reported with chronic alcohol treatment. Dysregulated hepatic lysine acetylation seen with impaired FAA hydrolysis could support the liver's role in fostering the pre-diabetic state, and may reflect part of the mechanism underlying the hepatic effects of endocannabinoids in alcoholic liver disease mouse models.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which FAAH affects energy expenditure (EE) remains unknown. Here we show that reduced energy expenditure in FAAH(-/-) mice could be attributed to decreased circulating triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations secondary to reduced mRNA expression of both pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone and hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone. These reductions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis were associated with activation of hypothalamic peroxisome proliferating-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), and increased hypothalamic deiodinase 2 expression. Infusion of NAEs (anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide) recapitulated increases in PPAR\u03b3-mediated decreases in EE. FAAH(-/-) mice were also prone to diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance, which could be attributed to increased hepatic diacylglycerol content and protein kinase C\u03b5 activation. Our data indicate that FAAH deletion, and the resulting increases in NAEs, predispose mice to ectopic lipid storage and hepatic insulin resistance by promoting centrally mediated hypothyroidism.",

Although environmental factors contribute to drug abuse and addiction, genetic factors also play a significant role estimated at 40-60% of the total risk. Nonetheless, the precise identities of human genes that confer vulnerability to problem drug use remain mostly unknown. Here, we describe a natural single nucleotide polymorphism in the human gene that encodes the principal endocannabinoid-inactivating enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), that in homozygous form is strongly associated with both street drug use and problem drug/alcohol use. This single nucleotide polymorphism results in a missense mutation (385C--&gt;A) that converts a conserved proline residue to threonine (Pro129--&gt;Thr), producing a FAAH variant that displays normal catalytic properties but an enhanced sensitivity to proteolytic degradation. Collectively, these results suggest that genetic mutations in FAAH may constitute important risk factors for problem drug use and support a potential link between functional abnormalities in the endogenous cannabinoid system and drug abuse and dependence.",

Endocannabinoid system (ECS) signaling in the brain and peripheral tissues is activated in obesity and plays a role in the regulation of body weight. The main research question here was whether quantitative measurement of plasma endocannabinoids, anandamide, and related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), combined with genotyping for mutations in fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) would identify circulating biomarkers of ECS activation in severe obesity. Plasma samples were obtained from 96 severely obese subjects with body mass index (BMI) of &gt; or = 40 kg/m(2), and 48 normal weight subjects with BMI of &lt; or = 26 kg/m(2). Triple-quadrupole mass spectroscopy methods were used to measure plasma ECS analogs. Subjects were genotyped for human FAAH gene mutations. The principal analysis focused on the FAAH 385 C--&gt;A (P129T) mutation by comparing plasma ECS metabolite levels in the FAAH 385 minor A allele carriers versus wild-type C/C carriers in both groups. The main finding was significantly elevated mean plasma levels of anandamide (15.1+/-1.4 pmol/ml) and related NAEs in study subjects that carried the FAAH 385 A mutant alleles versus normal subjects (13.3+/-1.0 pmol/ml) with wild-type FAAH genotype (p = 0.04), and significance was maintained after controlling for BMI. Significantly increased levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide and related NAEs were found in carriers of the FAAH 385 A mutant alleles compared with wild-type FAAH controls. This evidence supports endocannabinoid system activation due to the effect of FAAH 385 mutant A genotype on plasma AEA and related NAE analogs. This is the first study to document that FAAH 385 A mutant alleles have a direct effect on elevated plasma levels of anandamide and related NAEs in humans. These biomarkers may indicate risk for severe obesity and may suggest novel ECS obesity treatment strategies.",

Both compounds promote vacuolization of late endosome compartments and interfere with trafficking of late endosomes to lysosomes, without significant cytotoxicity. The results show that vacuolated cells treated with these compounds release exosomes with morphologies similar to untreated controls. However, both compounds trigger multi-fold increases in release of exosome marker proteins (e.g., CD63, Alix) in exosome fractions collected from equivalent numbers of cells. Despite the marked increase in exosome production, the profiles of selected miRNA cargoes carried by the exosomes were generally similar in cells treated with the compounds.

While intracranial complications of sinusitis are rare, the morbidity and mortality remain high. Subdural empyema is recognized as the most common sinogenic intracranial complication. We undertook a review of our cases of subdural empyema and other intracranial complications of sinusitis over the past 8 years at a busy inner city hospital. Our intent was to identify factors that may predispose children to these serious complications. A retrospective chart review was conducted using ICD-9 codes to identify pediatric patients treated for complications of sinusitis at University Hospital (UH) from 1996 to 2004. Only patients age 18 or younger at the time of admission were included in this study. The following data were collected from hospital medical records: age, gender, past medical and social history, presenting symptoms, history of present illness, microbiology, surgical and medical intervention, and outcome. Twelve patients were identified that fit the criteria for this study. The mean age of these patients was 14.1 years, and 10 of our 12 patients were male (83.3%). The most common presenting complaints were fever, headache, altered mental status, orbital cellulitis, nasal symptoms, nausea and vomiting, and photophobia. In the week prior to admission for intracranial complications, nine patients were seen by a physician: five patients were seen in the ER and four by a primary care physician. Subdural empyema was the most commonly observed intracranial complication in this series. Microaerophilic and anaerobic organisms were most commonly identified in this series. Most sinus procedures consisted of endoscopic ethmoid and maxillary sinus drainage. There was a long-term morbidity rate of 16% and a mortality rate of 8%. Three conclusions may be drawn from this study. First, the morbidity and mortality of intracranial complications of sinusitis remain high in the pediatric inner-city population despite adequate access to medical care. Second, subdural empyema appears to arise in the setting of subacute rather than acute frontal sinusitis.

Spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. The most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in particular those of the Streptococcus milleri group (S. milleri and Streptococcus anginosus). Staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including Gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides, may be present. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and Salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced AIDS; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. Spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by S. aureus. Subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical and neurosurgical emergency. The diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial and spinal subdural empyema is MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by MRI. Conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by CT myelography where MRI is negative. Treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. Pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. Because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against S. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and Gram-negative organisms.

Clinical features, diagnostic approach and management of subdural empyema are discussed. A 17-year-old male with a 2 day history of headache and nausea was referred to our Emergency Department (ED) as a case of possible meningitis. He was afebrile, lethargic and drowsy with significant neck stiffness on examination. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed a large frontotemporoparietal subdural fluid collection with significant midline shift. Subsequent contrast-enhanced CT established the presence of intracranial empyema; the patient underwent immediate burr-hole evacuation of the pus and received 7 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, recovering with no residual neurological deficit. The diagnosis of subdural empyema as a complication of asymptomatic sinusitis in an immunocompetent patient with no history of fever or upper respiratory symptoms was unanticipated. Furthermore, the organism Streptococcus pluranimalium that was cultured from the pus has only been documented twice previously in medical literature to cause infection in humans, as it is primarily a pathogen responsible for infection in bovine and avian species.

Our aim was to investigate whether a combined WM and EF training improves the understanding of spoken sentences in IWA. We used a pre-post-test case control design. Three individuals with chronic aphasia practised an adaptive training task (a modified n-back task) three to four times a week for a month. Their performance was assessed before and after the training on outcome measures related to WM and spoken sentence comprehension. One participant showed significant improvement on the training task, another showed a tendency for improvement, and both of them improved significantly in spoken sentence comprehension. The third participant did not improve on the training task, however, she showed improvement on one measure of spoken sentence comprehension. Compared to controls, two individuals improved at least in one condition of the WM outcome measures. Thus, our results suggest that a combined WM and EF training can be beneficial for IWA.",

To evaluate through an exploratory study the comprehensibility of PWA's pantomimes and to find out whether they can compensate for information PWA are unable to convey in speech. A total of 273 na\u00efve observers participated in one of two judgement tasks: forced-choice and open-ended questions. These were used to determine the comprehensibility of pantomimes produced to depict objects by PWA as compared with NBDP. Furthermore, we compared the information conveyed in pantomime with the information in speech. We looked into factors influencing pantomime's comprehensibility: individual factors, manner of depiction and information needed to be depicted. Although comprehensibility scores for PWA's pantomimes were lower than for those produced by NBDP, all PWA were able to convey information in pantomime that they could not convey in speech. Comprehensibility of pantomimes was predicted by apraxia. The inability to use the right hand related to slightly lower comprehensibility scores. Objects for which individuals depicted its use were best understood. Our findings highlight the potential benefit of pantomime for clinical practice.

The aim of this work is to understand how ligand binds and is affected by the molecular microenvironment in the active site of the LasR receptor for pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also study the stability of the interaction to find key structural characteristics that explain the antagonist activities of this set of ligands. This information is relevant for the rational modification or design of molecules and their identification as powerful LasR modulators. The analysis of molecular docking simulations shows that the 28 analogues have a similar binding mode compared to the native ligand. The carbonyl groups belonging to the lactone ring and the amide group of the acyl chain are oriented towards the amino acids forming hydrogen bond like interactions. The difference in antagonist activity is due to location and orientation of the LasR side chains within the hydrophobic pocket in its binding site. Additionally, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations to understand the conformational changes in the ligand-receptor interaction and the stability of each complex. Results show a direct relationship among the interaction energies of the ligands and the activities as an antagonist of the LasR receptor.",

Certain acyl-homoserine lactones can modulate mammalian cell function and are thought to contribute to bacterial pathogenicity. Given the role of mast cells in host defense, we investigated the ability of acyl-homoserine lactones to modulate mast cell function. We utilized murine primary mast cell cultures to assess the effect of acyl-homoserine lactones on degranulation and cytokine release in response to different stimuli. We also assessed cell migration in response to chemoattractants. The effect of acyl-homoserine lactones in vivo was tested using a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. Two of the tested quorum-sensing molecules, N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone and N-Dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone, inhibited IgE dependent and independent degranulation and mediator release from primary mast cells. Further testing of N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone, the most potent inhibitor and a product of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, revealed that it also attenuated chemotaxis and LPS induced cytokine production. In vivo, N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis response in mice. The ability of N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone to stabilize mast cells may contribute to the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but could potentially be exploited therapeutically in allergic disease.",

Little information is available regarding the role of AHL in biofilm formation in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The purpose of this investigation was to biochemically detect and characterize AHL activity in biofilm-forming uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) isolated from urine samples of the patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Kerman, Iran. Thirty-five UPEC isolates were obtained from urine samples of the patients with UTIs referred to the Afzalipoor hospital. The isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Biofilm analyses of all the isolates were performed using the microtiter plate method at OD 490nm. N-Acyl homoserine lactone was separated from cell mass supernatants by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and analyzed by a colorimetric method. N-Acyl homoserine lactone functional groups were identified by Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The biofilm formation assay identified 10 (28.57%) isolates with strong, 16 (45.71%) with moderate, and 9 (25.71%) with weak biofilm activities. The UPEC isolates with strong and weak biofilm activities were subjected to AHL analyses. It was found that isolates with the highest AHL activities also exhibited strong adherence to microplate wells (P\u22640.05). Two E. coli isolates with the highest AHL activities were selected for FT-IR spectroscopy.

This mechanism termed 'quorum sensing' is involved in the regulation of physiological functions as well as multiple virulence determinants. It becomes more and more evident, that bacteria communicate not only with each other but also with their host. Up to now, little is known about this interkingdom communication. The AHL quorum sensing molecule N-3-(oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to influence the immune system of the host. The role and potential influence of other AHL molecules from other bacteria have so far not been determined. In this paper, we investigated the role of 7 different AHLs on apoptosis of human Jurkat T lymphocytes. We found, that among all homoserine lactones tested, only OdDHL rapidly induced apoptosis which was accompanied by the breakdown of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). Since overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 completely abrogated the apoptotic effect, we presume that OdDHL induces apoptosis by activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The reason that bacteria induce apoptosis is largely unknown. We suspect that through apoptosis an anti-inflammatory response is triggered.",

AHL QS or bacterial cell-cell signaling is a method of bacterial communication and gene regulation and may be involved in nitrogen oxide fluxes or other important phenotypes in nitrifying bacteria. Here, we carried out a broad survey of AHL production in nitrifying bacteria in three steps. First, we analyzed the evolutionary history of AHL synthase and AHL receptor homologs in sequenced genomes and metagenomes of nitrifying bacteria to identify AHL synthase homologs in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) of the genus <i>Nitrosospira</i> and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) of the genera <i>Nitrococcus</i>, <i>Nitrobacter</i>, and <i>Nitrospira</i> Next, we screened cultures of both AOB and NOB with uncharacterized AHL synthase genes and AHL synthase-negative nitrifiers by a bioassay. Our results suggest that an AHL synthase gene is required for, but does not guarantee, cell density-dependent AHL production under the conditions tested. Finally, we utilized mass spectrometry to identify the AHLs produced by the AOB <i>Nitrosospira multiformis</i> and <i>Nitrosospira briensis</i> and the NOB <i>Nitrobacter vulgaris</i> and <i>Nitrospira moscoviensis</i> as <i>N</i>-decanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C<sub>10</sub>-HSL), <i>N</i>-3-hydroxy-tetradecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-OH-C<sub>14</sub>-HSL), a monounsaturated AHL (C<sub>10:1</sub>-HSL), and <i>N</i>-octanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C<sub>8</sub>-HSL), respectively. Our survey expands the list of AHL-producing nitrifiers to include a representative of <i>Nitrospira</i> lineage II and suggests that AHL production is widespread in nitrifying bacteria.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Nitrification, the aerobic oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite by nitrifying microorganisms, plays an important role in environmental nitrogen cycling from agricultural fertilization to wastewater treatment. The genomes of many nitrifying bacteria contain genes associated with bacterial cell-cell signaling or quorum sensing (QS). QS is a method of bacterial communication and gene regulation that is well studied in bacterial pathogens, but less is known about QS in environmental systems. Our previous work suggested that QS might be involved in the regulation of nitrogen oxide gas production during nitrite metabolism. This study characterized putative QS signals produced by different genera and species of nitrifiers. Our work lays the foundation for future experiments investigating communication between nitrifying bacteria, the purpose of QS in these microorganisms, and the manipulation of QS during nitrification.",

Traditionally, biological detection systems have been used to identify bacteria that produce acyl-homoserine lactones, although the specificities of these detection systems can limit discovery. We used a sensitive approach that did not require a bioassay to detect production of long-acyl-chain homoserine lactone production by Rhodobacter capsulatus and Paracoccus denitrificans. These long-chain acyl-homoserine lactones are not readily detected by standard bioassays. The most abundant acyl-homoserine lactone was N-hexadecanoyl-homoserine lactone. The long-chain acyl-homoserine lactones were concentrated in cells but were also found in the culture fluid. An R. capsulatus gene responsible for long-chain acyl-homoserine lactone synthesis was identified. A mutation in this gene, which we named gtaI, resulted in decreased production of the R. capsulatus gene transfer agent, and gene transfer agent production was restored by exogenous addition of N-hexadecanoyl-homoserine lactone. Thus, long-chain acyl-homoserine lactones serve as quorum-sensing signals to enhance genetic exchange in R. capsulatus.",

Ibrutinib was proven as a primary choice for patients with the TP53 gene deletion/mutation, who otherwise have no active treatment available. Idelalisib with rituximab is also an active therapy, but due to increased risk of serious infections, its use in first-line treatment is limited to patients for whom ibrutinib is not an option.

This was a retrospective analysis of patients treated with rituximab for off-label indications from January 2007 to December 2009 in two tertiary hospitals. Information on patient characteristics, medical conditions, and therapeutic responses was collected from medical records. Available evidence for the efficacy of rituximab in each condition was reviewed, and the cost of treatment was calculated. A total of 101 cases of off-label rituximab use were analyzed. The median age of the patients involved was 53 [interquartile range (IQR) 37.5-68.0] years; 55.4 % were women. The indications for prescribing rituximab were primarily hematological diseases (46 %), systemic connective tissue disorders (27 %), and kidney diseases (20 %). Available evidence supporting rituximab treatment for these indications mainly came from individual cohort studies (53.5 % of cases) and case series (25.7 %). The short-term outcome (median 3 months, IQR 2-4 months) was a complete response in 38 % of cases and partial response in 32.6 %. The highest short-term responses were observed for systemic lupus erythematosus and membranous glomerulonephritis, and the lowest was for neuromyelitis optica, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and miscellaneous indications. Some response was maintained in long-term follow-up (median 23 months IQR 12-30 months) in 69.2 % of patients showing a short-term response. Median cost per patient was \u20ac5,187.5 (IQR \u20ac5,187.5-7,781.3). In our study, off-label rituximab was mainly used for the treatment of hematological, kidney, and systemic connective tissue disorders, and the response among our patient cohort was variable depending on the specific disease. The level of evidence supporting the use of rituximab for these indications was low and the cost was very high. We conclude that more clinical trials on the off-label use of rituximab are needed, although these may be difficult to conduct in some rare diseases. Data from observational studies may provide useful information to assist prescribing in clinical practice.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16227208": "The Pim kinases are a family of three vertebrate protein serine/threonine kinases (Pim-1, -2, and -3) belonging to the CAMK (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-related) group. Pim kinases are emerging as important mediators of cytokine signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells, and they contribute to the progression of certain leukemias and solid tumors. A number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins are phosphorylated by Pim kinases and may act as their effectors in normal physiology and in disease. Recent crystallographic studies of Pim-1 have identified unique structural features but have not provided insight into how the kinase recognizes its target substrates. Here, we have conducted peptide library screens to exhaustively determine the sequence specificity of active site-mediated phosphorylation by Pim-1 and Pim-3. We have identified the major site of Pim-1 autophosphorylation and find surprisingly that it maps to a novel site that diverges from its consensus phosphorylation motif. We have solved the crystal structure of Pim-1 bound to a high affinity peptide substrate in complexes with either the ATP analog AMP-PNP or the bisindolylmaleimide kinase inhibitor 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide HCl. These structures reveal an unanticipated mode of recognition for basic residues upstream of the phosphorylation site, distinct from that of other kinases with similar substrate specificity. The structures provide a rationale for the unusually high affinity of Pim kinases for peptide substrates and suggest a general mode for substrate binding to members of the CAMK group.",

The etiology of hypercontractility is not completely understood. New therapeutic targets remain vitally important for drug discovery. Here we report that Pim kinases, in combination with DAPK3, regulate contractility and control hypertension. Using a co-crystal structure of lead molecule (HS38) in complex with DAPK3, a dual Pim/DAPK3 inhibitor (HS56) and selective DAPK3 inhibitors (HS94 and HS148) were developed to provide mechanistic insight into the polypharmacology of hypertension. In vitro and ex vivo studies indicated that Pim kinases directly phosphorylate smooth muscle targets and that Pim/DAPK3 inhibition, unlike selective DAPK3 inhibition, significantly reduces contractility. In vivo, HS56 decreased blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive mice in a dose-dependent manner without affecting heart rate. These findings suggest including Pim kinase inhibition within a multi-target engagement strategy for hypertension management. HS56 represents a significant step in the development of molecularly targeted antihypertensive medications.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25575657": "PIM kinases are implicated in variety of cancers by promoting cell survival and proliferation and are targets of interest for therapeutic intervention. We have identified a low-nanomolar pan-PIM inhibitor (PIM1/2/3 potency 5:14:2nM) using structure based modeling. The crystal structure of this compound with PIM1 confirmed the predicted binding mode and protein-ligand interactions except those in the acidic ribose pocket. We show the SAR suggesting the importance of having a hydrogen bond donor in this pocket for inhibiting PIM2; however, this interaction is not important for inhibiting PIM1 or PIM3. In addition, we report the discovery of a new class of PIM inhibitors by using computational de novo design tool implemented in MOE software (Chemical Computing Group). These inhibitors have a different interaction profile.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22926267": "We employ ensemble docking simulations to characterize the interactions of two enantiomeric forms of a Ru-complex compound (1-R and 1-S) with three protein kinases, namely PIM1, GSK-3\u03b2, and CDK2/cyclin A. We show that our ensemble docking computational protocol adequately models the structural features of these interactions and discriminates between competing conformational clusters of ligand-bound protein structures. Using the determined X-ray crystal structure of PIM1 complexed to the compound 1-R as a control, we discuss the importance of including the protein flexibility inherent in the ensemble docking protocol, for the accuracy of the structure prediction of the bound state. A comparison of our ensemble docking results suggests that PIM1 and GSK-3\u03b2 bind the two enantiomers in similar fashion, through two primary binding modes: conformation I, which is very similar to the conformation presented in the existing PIM1/compound 1-R crystal structure; conformation II, which represents a 180\u00b0 flip about an axis through the NH group of the pyridocarbazole moiety, relative to conformation I. In contrast, the binding of the enantiomers to CDK2 is found to have a different structural profile including a suggested bound conformation, which lacks the conserved hydrogen bond between the kinase and the ligand (i.e., ATP, staurosporine, Ru-complex compound). The top scoring conformation of the inhibitor bound to CDK2 is not present among the top-scoring conformations of the inhibitor bound to either PIM1 or GSK-3\u03b2 and vice-versa. Collectively, our results help provide atomic-level insights into inhibitor selectivity among the three kinases.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23936194": "Human Pim1 kinase is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays important biological roles in cell survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. Moreover, Pim1 is up-regulated in various hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. Thus, Pim1 is an attractive target for cancer therapeutics, and there has been growing interest in developing small molecule inhibitors for Pim1. Here, we describe the crystal structure of Pim1 in complex with a newly developed pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine-derivative inhibitor (SKI-O-068). Our inhibitor exhibits a half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 123 (\u00b114) nM and has an unusual binding mode in complex with Pim1 kinase. The interactions between SKI-O-068 and the Pim1 active site pocket residue are different from those of other scaffold inhibitor-bound structures. The binding mode analysis suggests that the SKI-O-068 inhibitor can be improved by introducing functional groups that facilitate direct interaction with Lys67, which aid in the design of an optimized inhibitor.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22339127": "We have studied the subtleties of fragment docking and binding using data generated in a Pim-1 kinase inhibitor program. Crystallographic and docking data analyses have been undertaken using inhibitor complexes derived from an in-house surface plasmon resonance (SPR) fragment screen, a virtual needle screen, and a de novo designed fragment inhibitor hybrid. These investigations highlight that fragments that do not fill their binding pocket can exhibit promiscuous hydrophobic interactions due to the lack of steric constraints imposed on them by the boundaries of said pocket. As a result, docking modes that disagree with an observed crystal structure but maintain key crystallographically observed hydrogen bonds still have potential value in ligand design and optimization. This observation runs counter to the lore in fragment-based drug design that all fragment elaboration must be based on the parent crystal structure alone.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15808862": "Pim1, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in several biological functions including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. While pim1 has been shown to be involved in several hematopoietic cancers, it was also recently identified as a target of aberrant somatic hypermutation in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The crystal structures of Pim1 in apo form and bound with AMPPNP have been solved and several unique features of Pim1 were identified, including the presence of an extra beta-hairpin in the N-terminal lobe and an unusual conformation of the hinge connecting the two lobes of the enzyme. While the apo Pim1 structure is nearly identical with that reported recently, the structure of AMPPNP bound to Pim1 is significantly different. Pim1 is unique among protein kinases due to the presence of a proline residue at position 123 that precludes the formation of the canonical second hydrogen bond between the hinge backbone and the adenine moiety of ATP. One crystal structure reported here shows that changing P123 to methionine, a common residue that offers the backbone hydrogen bond to ATP, does not restore the ATP binding pocket of Pim1 to that of a typical kinase. These unique structural features in Pim1 result in novel binding modes of AMP and a known kinase inhibitor scaffold, as shown by co-crystallography. In addition, the kinase activities of five Pim1 mutants identified in DLCL patients have been determined. In each case, the observed effects on kinase activity are consistent with the predicted consequences of the mutation on the Pim1 structure. Finally, 70 co-crystal structures of low molecular mass, low-affinity compounds with Pim1 have been solved in order to identify novel chemical classes as potential Pim1 inhibitors. Based on the structural information, opportunities for optimization of one specific example are discussed.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28767130": " Glioblastomas are highly aggressive and treatment resistant. Increasing evidence suggests that tumour-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) facilitate tumour progression by acquiring a M2-like phenotype. Our objective was to investigate the prognostic value of TAMs in gliomas using automated quantitative double immunofluorescence. Samples from 240 patients with primary glioma were stained with antibodies against ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) and cluster of differentiation 204 (CD204) to detect TAMs and M2-like TAMs. The expression levels were quantified by software-based classifiers. The associations between TAMs, gemistocytic cells and glioblastoma subtype were examined with immuno- and haematoxylin-eosin stainings. Three tissue arrays containing glioblastoma specimens were included to study IBA-1/CD204 levels in central tumour and tumour periphery and to characterize CD204<sup>+</sup> cells. Our data revealed that the amount of especially CD204<sup>+</sup> TAMs increases with malignancy grade. In grade III-IV, high CD204 expression was associated with shorter survival, while high IBA-1 intensity correlated with a longer survival. In grade IV, CD204 showed independent prognostic value when adjusting for clinical data and the methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. Our findings were confirmed in two bioinformatics databases. TAMs were more abundant in central tumour tissue, mesenchymal glioblastomas and gliomas with many gemistocytic cells. CD204<sup>+</sup> TAMs co-expressed proteins related to tumour aggressiveness including matrix metallopeptidase-14 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1. This is the first study to use automated quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the prognostic impact of TAMs. Our results suggest that M2-like TAMs hold an unfavourable prognostic value in high-grade gliomas and may contribute to a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089530": "Pancreatic stellate cells are key mediators in chronic pancreatitis and play a central role in the development of pancreatic fibrosis, stromal formation, and progression of pancreatic cancer. This study was aimed at investigating molecular changes at the level of the proteome that are associated with the activation of pancreatic stellate cells by proinflammatory factors, namely TNF-\u03b1, FGF2, IL6, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4). They were added individually to cells growing in serum-free medium next to controls in medium supplemented with serum, thus containing a mixture of them all, or in serum-free medium alone. Variations were detected by means of a microarray of 810 antibodies targeting relevant proteins. All tested factors triggered increased proliferation and migration. Further analysis showed that TNF-\u03b1 is the prime factor responsible for the activation of pancreatic stellate cells. CCL4 is associated with cellular neovascularization, whereas FGF2 and IL6 induction led to better cellular survival and decreased apoptotic activity of the stellate cells. The identified direct effects of individual cytokines on human pancreatic stellate cells provide new insights about their contribution to pancreatic cancer promotion.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20689058": "Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Recent studies have suggested a role of IL-33, a newly identified IL-1 family member, in fibrosis. We here examined the expression of IL-33 and the IL-33-mediated regulation of cell functions in PSCs. PSCs were isolated from human and rat pancreas tissues. The expression of IL-33 was examined by Western blotting, PCR, ELISA, and immunostaining. The roles of IL-33 in the regulation of PSC functions were examined by using recombinant IL-33 and small interfering RNA. Activated PSCs expressed IL-33 in the nucleus, and the expression was increased by IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, PDGF-BB, and IFN-\u03b3, but not TGF-\u03b21. Nuclear IL-33 expression was also observed in the pancreatic acinar and ductal cells. IL-1\u03b2 induced IL-33 expression mainly through the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK pathways and partially through that of p38 MAP kinase, whereas PDGF-BB induced IL-33 expression mainly through the activation of ERK pathway. PSCs expressed soluble ST2, ST2L, and IL-1RAcP, but the expression level of ST2L was relatively low. Recombinant IL-33 did not stimulate key cell functions of PSCs. Decreased IL-33 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased proliferation in response to PDGF-BB. In conclusion, activated PSCs expressed IL-33 in the nucleus. IL-33 might regulate the PDGF-induced proliferation in PSCs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158129": "Interest in the recently discovered phenomenon of mitochondrial transfer between mammalian cells has gained momentum since it was first described in cell culture systems more than a decade ago. Mitochondria-targeting fluorescent dyes have been repurposed and are now widely used in these studies and in acute disease models, sometimes without due consideration of their limitations, while vectors containing mitochondrially-imported fluorescent proteins have complemented the use of mitochondria-targeting dyes. Genetic approaches that use mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms have also been used in some in vitro studies and in tumor models and are particularly useful where mtDNA is damaged or deleted. These approaches can also be used to study the long-term consequences of mitochondrial transfer such as in bone marrow and organ transplantation and in tumour biology where inherent mitochondrial damage is often a key feature. As research on intercellular mitochondrial transfer moves from cell culture into animal models and human diseases it will be important to understand the limitations of the various techniques in order to apply appropriate methodologies to address physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357914": " Despite the high cure rate of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), drug resistance to chemotherapy remains a significant clinical problem. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) protect leukemic cells from chemotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to uncover the mechanism of MSC-induced chemoresistance in T-ALL cells, thus providing a promising clinical therapy target. Cell viability was determined using the viability assay kit CCK-8. The mitochondrial ROS levels were detected using the fluorescent probe MitoSOX\u2122 Red, and fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. In vitro, MSCs and Jurkat cells were cocultured. MSCs were labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and Jurkat cells were labeled with the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker Red. Bidirectional mitochondrial transfer was detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The mechanism of mitochondria transfer was analyzed by inhibitor assays. Transcripts related to Jurkat cell/MSC adhesion in the coculture system were assessed by qRT-PCR. After treatment with a neutralizing antibody against a key adhesion molecule, mitochondria transfer from Jurkat cells to MSCs was again detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Finally, we verified our findings using human primary T-ALL cells cocultured with MSCs. Chemotherapeutic drugs caused intracellular oxidative stress in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells transfer mitochondria to MSCs but receive few mitochondria from MSCs, resulting in chemoresistance. This process of mitochondria transfer is mediated by tunneling nanotubes, which are protrusions that extend from the cell membrane . Moreover, we found that most Jurkat cells adhered to MSCs in the coculture system, which was mediated by the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody against ICAM-1 led to a decreased number of adhering Jurkat cells, decreased mitochondria transfer, and increased chemotherapy-induced cell death. We show evidence that mitochondria transfer from Jurkat cells to MSCs, which is mediated by cell adhesion, may be a potential therapeutic target for T-ALL treatment."
