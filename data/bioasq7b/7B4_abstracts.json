This consists of the attachment of mono- or poly-<i><i>adenosine diphosphate</i></i> (ADP)-ribose units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) to specific polar residues of target proteins. PARP1 is the most abundant and best-characterized member of the family of PARP enzymes. PARP1 plays key roles in DNA repair, as well as a wide variety of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin modulation, cellular signaling pathway, inflammation, cellular stress responses and so on. Hence, PARP1 inhibitors have become a promising therapeutic approach for human diseases including cancer. Recent studies indicate that post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation are crucial for the regulation of PARP1 activity, and dysregulation of modifications on PARP1 is observed in human cancer. In this review, we describe the importance of PTMs to regulate the activity of PARP1, and the involvement of dysregulation of PTMs in human cancer.",

Previous reports suggested a dynamic modulation of the chromatin landscape during adipocyte differentiation. We thus hypothesized that PARP1 plays an important transcriptional role in adipogenesis and metabolism and therefore used adipocyte development and function as a model to elucidate the molecular action of PARP1 in obesity-related diseases. Our results show that PARP1-dependent ADP-ribose polymer (PAR) formation increases during adipocyte development and, at late time points of adipogenesis, is involved in the sustained expression of PPAR\u03b32 and of PPAR\u03b32 target genes. During adipogenesis, PARP1 was recruited to PPAR\u03b32 target genes such as CD36 or aP2 in a PAR-dependent manner. Our results also reveal a PAR-dependent decrease in repressory histone marks (e.g. H3K9me3) and an increase in stimulatory marks (e.g. H3K4me3) at the PPAR\u03b32 promoter, suggesting that PARP1 may exert its regulatory function during adipogenesis by altering histone marks. Interestingly, activation of PARP1 enzymatic activity was prevented with a topoisomerase II inhibitor. These data hint at topoisomerase II-dependent, transient, site-specific double-strand DNA breaks as the cause for poly(ADP)-ribose formation, adipogenic gene expression, and adipocyte function. Together, our study identifies PARP1 as a critical regulator of PPAR\u03b32-dependent gene expression with implications in adipocyte function and obesity-related disease models.",

At the cellular level, PARP1 has been implicated in a wide range of processes, such as maintenance of genome stability, cell death, and transcription. PARP1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1). In proteomic studies, PARP1 was found to be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs). Here, we characterize PARP1 as a substrate for modification by SUMO1 and SUMO3, both in vitro and in vivo. PARP1 is sumoylated at the single lysine residue K486 within its automodification domain. Interestingly, modification of PARP1 with SUMO does not affect its ADP-ribosylation activity but completely abrogates p300-mediated acetylation of PARP1, revealing an intriguing crosstalk of sumoylation and acetylation on PARP1. Genetic complementation of PARP1-depleted cells with wild-type and sumoylation-deficient PARP1 revealed that SUMO modification of PARP1 restrains its transcriptional coactivator function and subsequently reduces gene expression of distinct PARP1-regulated target genes.",

In this work we identify a physical and functional poly(ADP-ribose)-mediated interaction of PARP1 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 (also known as NP95, ICBP90) that influences two UHRF1-regulated cellular processes. On the one hand, we uncovered a cooperative interplay between PARP1 and UHRF1 in the accumulation of the heterochromatin repressive mark H4K20me3. The absence of PARP1 led to reduced accumulation of H4K20me3 onto pericentric heterochromatin that coincided with abnormally enhanced transcription. The loss of H4K20me3 was rescued by the additional depletion of UHRF1. In contrast, although PARP1 also seemed to facilitate the association of UHRF1 with DNMT1, its absence did not impair the loading of DNMT1 onto heterochromatin or the methylation of pericentric regions, possibly owing to a compensating interaction of DNMT1 with PCNA. On the other hand, we showed that PARP1 controls the UHRF1-mediated ubiquitination of DNMT1 to timely regulate its abundance during S and G2 phase. Together, this report identifies PARP1 as a novel modulator of two UHRF1-regulated heterochromatin-associated events: the accumulation of H4K20me3 and the clearance of DNMT1.",

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is known for its function in nuclear DNA repair. In this study, we have employed genetic deletion and chemical inhibition approaches to determine the role of PARP1 in maintaining mtDNA dependent mitochondrial function in Chagas disease. Our data show that expression of PARP1 and protein PARylation were increased by &gt;2-fold and &gt;16-fold, respectively, in the cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions of the human cardiac myocytes and the myocardium of wildtype (WT) mice chronically infected with T. cruzi. The nuclear and cytosolic PARP1/PAR did not interfere with the transcription and translation of the components of the mtDNA replisome machinery in infected cardiomyocytes and chagasic murine myocardium. However, PARP1 binding to Polymerase \u03b3 and mtDNA in mitochondria were increased, and associated with a loss in mtDNA content, mtDNA-encoded gene expression, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, and an increase in mitochondrial ROS production in cells and heart of WT mice infected with T. cruzi. Subsequently, an increase in oxidative stress, and cardiac collagen deposition, and a decline in LV function was noted in chagasic mice. Genetic deletion of PARP1 or treatment with selective inhibitor of PARP1 (PJ34) improved the mtDNA content, mitochondrial function, and oxidant/antioxidant balance in human cardiomyocytes and chronically infected mice. Further, PARP1 inhibition was beneficial in preserving the cardiac structure and left ventricular function in chagasic mice. We conclude that PARP1 overexpression is associated with a decline in Pol \u03b3-dependent maintenance of mtDNA content, mtDNA-encoded gene expression, and mitochondrial respiratory function, and subsequently contributes to an increase in mtROS and oxidative stress in chagasic myocardium. Inhibition of mitochondrial PARP1/PAR offers a novel therapy in preserving the mitochondrial and LV function in chronic Chagas disease.",

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that mediate EBV replication during latency. In this study, we detail the mechanisms that drive cellular PARylation during latent EBV infection and the effects of PARylation on host gene expression and cellular function. EBV-infected B cells had higher PAR levels than EBV-negative B cells. Moreover, cellular PAR levels were up to 2-fold greater in type III than type I latently infected EBV B cells. We identified a positive association between expression of the EBV genome-encoded latency membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and PAR levels that was dependent upon PARP1. PARP1 regulates gene expression by numerous mechanisms, including modifying chromatin structure and altering the function of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Since LMP1 is essential in establishing EBV latency and promoting tumorigenesis, we explored the model that disruption in cellular PARylation, driven by LMP1 expression, subsequently promotes epigenetic alterations to elicit changes in host gene expression. PARP1 inhibition resulted in the accumulation of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at a subset of LMP1-regulated genes. Inhibition of PARP1, or abrogation of PARP1 expression, also suppressed the expression of LMP1-activated genes and LMP1-mediated cellular transformation, demonstrating an essential role for PARP1 activity in LMP1-induced gene expression and cellular transformation associated with LMP1. In summary, we identified a novel mechanism by which LMP1 drives expression of host tumor-promoting genes by blocking generation of the inhibitory histone modification H3K27me3 through PARP1 activation. EBV is causally linked to several malignancies and is responsible for 1% of cancer incidence worldwide. The EBV-encoded protein LMP1 is essential for promoting viral tumorigenesis by aberrant activation of several well-known intracellular signaling pathways. We have identified and defined an additional novel molecular mechanism by which LMP1 regulates the expression of tumor-promoting host genes. We found that LMP1 activates the cellular protein PARP1, leading to a decrease in a repressive histone modification, accompanied by induction in expression of multiple cancer-related genes. PARP1 inhibition or depletion led to a decrease in LMP1-induced cellular transformation. Therefore, targeting PARP1 activity may be an effective treatment for EBV-associated malignancies.",

It is directly genotoxic by inducing DNA strand breaks and cytotoxic by promoting apoptosis in lung target cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is a nuclear zinc-finger protein with a function as a DNA damage sensor. To determine whether PARP1 is involved in asbestos-induced carcinogenesis, PARP1 expression and activity as well as DNA damage and repair were evaluated in circulating cells of asbestos-exposed subjects, MM patients and age-matched controls. PARP1 expression and activity were also evaluated in pleural biopsies of MM patients and compared with normal tissue. Accumulation of the pre-mutagenic 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and elevated PARP1 expression were found both in asbestos-exposed subjects and MM patients. Although PARP1 was highly expressed, its activity was relatively low. Low DNA repair efficiency was observed in lymphocytes from MM patients. High expression of PARP1 associated with low PARP activity was also found in MM biopsies. To mimic PARP1 dysfunction, PARP1 expression and activity were induced in immortalised mesothelial cells by their exposure to asbestos in the presence of a PARP1 inhibitor, which resulted in transformation of the cells. We propose that exposure to asbestos inhibits the PARP1 activity possibly resulting in higher DNA instability, thus causing malignant transformation.",

However, a large phase 3 trial of semagacestat, a potential non-transition state analog (non-TSA) GSI, in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) was terminated due to unexpected aggravation of cognitive deficits and side effects. Here, we show that some semagacestat effects are clearly different from a phenotype caused by a loss of function of presenilins, core proteins in the \u03b3-secretase complex. Semagacestat increases intracellular byproduct peptides, produced along with A\u03b2 through serial \u03b3-cleavage of \u03b2APP, as well as intracellular long A\u03b2 species, in cell-based and in vivo studies of AD model mice. Other potential non-TSA GSIs, but not L685,458, a TSA GSI, have similar effects. Furthermore, semagacestat inhibits release of de novo intramembranous \u03b3-byproducts to the soluble space. Thus, semagacestat is a pseudo-GSI, and therefore, the semagacestat clinical trial did not truly test the A\u03b2 hypothesis.",

We sought to examine the effect of semagacestat treatment on neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). 1,537 participants with mild to moderate AD were randomized to 76 weeks' treatment with placebo versus two doses of semagacestat. NPS were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Total and subdomains). Cognition was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (first 11 items, ADAS11). Mixed-Model Repeated Measures was used to compare the effects of treatment assignment on change in NPI-total and subdomains over time. Survival analysis was used to assess the treatment effect on time to first worsening of NPS (NPI-Total \u226510 or NPI subdomain \u22654) for subjects with no or minor NPS at baseline. Participants on high dose semagecestat (140 mg) had greater increase in NPI-Total and greater risk of incident first worsening in NPI-Total and in subdomains of aberrant motor behavior, appetite, depression/dysphoria, and sleep. ADAS11 increased more in participants whose NPI-Total increased. In participants with mild to moderate AD, high dose semagacestat treatment was associated with greater severity and faster worsening of NPS in a pattern resembling an agitated depression. Increased NPS was associated with cognitive decline regardless of treatment assignment. These findings suggest that greater NPS may be the result of gamma-secretase treatment and emphasize the importance of monitoring NPS as potential adverse events in trials of novel treatments for AD.",

One of the main obstacles is the poor predictive validity of our preclinical animal models. In the present study the effects of the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat was evaluated in preclinical in vivo electrophysiological models. Recently disclosed Phase III findings on semagacestat indicated that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on this drug showed significantly worsened cognitive function compared to those treated with placebo. Since previous studies have shown that drugs impairing cognitive function (including scopolamine, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonists, and nociceptin receptor agonists) disrupt or decrease power of elicited theta oscillation in the hippocampus, we tested the effects of acute and sub-chronic administration of semagacestat in this assay. Field potentials were recorded across the hippocampal formation with NeuroNexus multi-site silicon probes in urethane anesthetized male C57BL/6 mice; hippocampal CA1 theta oscillation was elicited by electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis. Sub-chronic administration of semagacestat twice daily over 12 days at a dose known to reduce beta-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) level [100 mg/kg, p.o.

We propose that the disruptive effect of semagacestat on hippocampal function could be one of the contributing mechanisms to its worsening of cognition in patients with AD. As it has been expected, both acute and sub-chronic administrations of semagacestat significantly decreased A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels but the current findings do not reveal the mode of action of semagacestat in disrupting hippocampal oscillation.",

The mutated form of the IDH1 enzyme produces a metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which is thought to play a role in the formation and progression of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), gliomas and other cancers. Elevated 2-HG levels interfere with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, thereby contributing to oncogenesis. Ivosidenib targets the IDH1 metabolic pathway to prevent a build-up of the oncometabolite 2-HG. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ivosidenib leading to this first approval in the USA for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation.

Recent clinical and genetic studies display an association between apoE genotype (APOE) and the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis, raising the possibility that modulation of apoE may be a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability. Histopathological analysis showed that COG112 and COG133 attenuated demyelination and significantly diminished the number of peripheral cells infiltrating into the spinal cord. ApoE mimetics also interfered with several mechanisms relevant to the pathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis, including activation of macrophages, subsequent production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines, and lymphocyte proliferation. These data suggest that apoE mimetics represent a multidimensional therapeutic for multiple sclerosis capable of inhibiting the inflammatory cascade, modulating immune cell function, and reducing clinical signs, which may have novel utility for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases.",

However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies for NASH. Given the disease burden, there is an important unmet need for pharmacologic treatment options for this patient population. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are complex and reflected by the myriad of therapies, with different targets, currently under investigation.

GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently approved for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH, and also have beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects. Innovative NASH therapies include four main pathways. The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation. Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate, elafibranor), medications targeting farnesoid X receptor axis [obeticholic acid; OCA)], inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues.

A third target is intestinal microbiomes and metabolic endotoxemia. Several agents are in ongoing trials, including IMMe124, TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics). The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly associated with all-cause or liver-related mortality in NASH. Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine-cysteine motif chemokine receptor-2/5 antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and galectin 3 antagonist.

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of pazopanib in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. In this non-randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, adult patients with clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease were recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and were treated with pazopanib (800 mg orally daily) for 24 weeks, with an option to continue treatment if desired by the patient and treating physician. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response and safety in the per-protocol population. The objective response was measured for each patient and each lesion type. Radiographic assessments were done at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout the study. Activity and safety were assessed with continuous monitoring and a Bayesian design.

The proliferation of whole genome sequencing represents an unprecedented opportunity to glean new insights into telomere biology on a previously unimaginable scale. To this end, a number of approaches for estimating telomere length from whole-genome sequencing data have been proposed. Here we present Telomerecat, a novel approach to the estimation of telomere length. Previous methods have been dependent on the number of telomeres present in a cell being known, which may be problematic when analysing aneuploid cancer data and non-human samples. Telomerecat is designed to be agnostic to the number of telomeres present, making it suited for the purpose of estimating telomere length in cancer studies. Telomerecat also accounts for interstitial telomeric reads and presents a novel approach to dealing with sequencing errors. We show that Telomerecat performs well at telomere length estimation when compared to leading experimental and computational methods. Furthermore, we show that it detects expected patterns in longitudinal data, repeated measurements, and cross-species comparisons.

Here we demonstrate a synaptogenic function of netrin-1 in rat and mouse cortical neurons and investigate the underlying mechanism. We report that netrin-1 and its receptor DCC are widely expressed by neurons in the developing mammalian cortex during synapse formation and are enriched at synapses in vivo. We detect DCC protein distributed along the axons and dendrites of cultured cortical neurons and provide evidence that newly translated netrin-1 is selectively transported to dendrites. Using gain and loss of function manipulations, we demonstrate that netrin-1 increases the number and strength of excitatory synapses made between developing cortical neurons. We show that netrin-1 increases the complexity of axon and dendrite arbors, thereby increasing the probability of contact. At sites of contact, netrin-1 promotes adhesion, while locally enriching and reorganizing the underlying actin cytoskeleton through Src family kinase signaling and m-Tor-dependent protein translation to locally cluster presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. Finally, we demonstrate using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology that netrin-1 increases the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons.

Inactivating netrin-1, deleted in colorectal cancer, or uncoordinated-5 homolog B (UNC5B) decreases YAP protein levels, abrogating cancer cell progression by netrin-1, whereas knockdown of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) or large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (Lats1/2), two sets of upstream core kinases of the Hippo pathway, has no effect in blocking netrin-1-induced up-regulation of YAP.

Importantly, UPR is implicated in chronic liver conditions including hepatic oncogenesis. Netrin-1's implication in cell survival on UPR in this context is unknown. Isolation of translational complexes, determination of RNA secondary structures by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension/dimethyl sulfate, bicistronic constructs, as well as conventional cell biology and biochemistry approaches were used on in vitro-grown hepatocytic cells, wild-type, and netrin-1 transgenic mice.

Netrin-4 is a novel member of netrin family recently identified in the vertebrate with neuritis elongation promoting activity; however, the receptors for netrin-4 are still unknown. To better understand the function and signal transduction pathway of netrin-4, the potential receptors for netrin-4 were studied in this paper. The netrin-4 protein was prepared by introducing a eukaryotic expression vector with a secretable alkaline phosphatase tag (AP4) into COS7 cells to allow the expression of AP4-netrin4 fusion protein. Axon guidance activity of netrin-4 was confirmed by using the cortical explants. After incubation with cultured primary cortical neurons, the neurons were distinctly labeled by the AP4-coupled netrin-4 ligands. In contrast, the binding activity of AP4-netrin4 to neurons could be completely competed by the exogenously expressed netrin-4 protein without AP4 tag, indicating specificity of netrin-4 binding to the potential receptors. Moreover, netrin-4 could also bind to CHO cells transfected with the plasmids expressing two known receptors for netrin-1, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and UNC5 homolog 1 (UNC5H1) respectively. As there are three domains in netrin-4, we further tried to narrow down the region containing binding sites with the receptors. Interestingly, only the N-terminal domain (LNT) could bind to DCC and UNC5H1. A further ligand-receptor binding analysis showed that both the N- and the C-terminal domain (NCT) but not the EGF-like (EGFL) domain of netrin-4 could bind to the surface of cultured primary neurons, indicating the existence of novel receptors for netrin-4. After competed by netrin-4, we confirmed that the binding of AP tagged netrin-4 domains to neurons were also netrin-4 dependent. The binding activity of the N-terminal domain of netrin-4 is about 3-fold higher than that for the C-terminal domain. In summary, our data here indicated that the two known receptors for netrin-1, DCC and UNC5H1, are also receptors for netrin-4, while only LNT but not EGFL and NCT is the key domain for specific binding. In addition, there are novel receptors for netrin-4, where both LNT and NCT but not EGFL are key domains for binding.",

We prepared and tested a library of analogs of palmitoyl 4-methylumbelifferyl esters to find a highly active and specific substrate for LAL in DBS. The LAL assay was optimized leading to both LC-MS/MS and fluorometric assay of LAL. We tested the new assay on DBS from healthy and LAL-deficient patients. The ester formed between palmitic acid and 4-propyl-8-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (P-PMHC) was found to be &gt;98% selective for LAL in DBS based on the sensitivity of its activity to the LAL-specific inactivator Lalistat-2 and the fact that the activity was close to zero using DBS from patients previously shown to be LAL-deficient. Use of P-PMHC and heavy isotope-labeled internal standard with optimized assay conditions led to an approximately 2-fold increase in the specific activity of LAL compared with the previously reported LAL assay. Patients deficient in LAL were readily distinguished from normal persons with the new LAL assay using UPLC-MS/MS or fluorometric assay platforms. The new assay can measure LAL in DBS with a single measurement compared with the previous method involving 2 assays done in parallel.",

Recently enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alpha has been approved by drug agencies for treatment of this lysosomal disease. Ezetimibe is an azetidine derivative which blocks Niemann Pick C1-Like 1 Protein; as its consequence, plasmatic concentration of low density lipoproteins and other apoB-containing lipoproteins, that are the substrate of lysosomal acid lipase, are decreased. Furthermore, ezetimibe acts by blocking inflammasome activation which is the cause of liver fibrosis in steatohepatitis and in lysosomal storage diseases. Two patients with Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease were treated with ezetimibe for 9 years and a third patients for 10 years. Treatment was supplemented with low dose of atorvastatin in the first two patients during the last 6 years. All patients showed a significant reduction of alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglyceride. Furthermore, no progression of liver fibrosis was demonstrated. In this observational case series, ezetimibe is effective, safe, and sustainable treatment for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate that ezetimibe is an alternative therapy to enzyme replacement therapy.",

The essential role of LAL in lipid metabolism has been confirmed in human and mice with LAL deficiency. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of LIPA cause rare lysosomal disorders, Wolman disease, and cholesteryl ester storage disease, in which LAL enzyme replacement therapy has shown significant benefits in a phase 3 clinical trial. Recent studies have revealed the role of LAL-mediated lysosomal lipolysis in regulating macrophage M2 polarization, lipid mediator production, VLDL secretion, lysosomal function and autophagy, extracellular degradation of aggregated-LDL, and adipose tissue lipolysis. Genome-wide association studies and functional genomic studies have identified LIPA as a risk locus for CHD, but the causal variants and mechanisms remain to be determined. Despite years of research, our understanding of LAL is incomplete. Future studies will continue to focus on the key pathophysiological functions of LAL in health and diseases including CHD.",

Human lysosomal acid lipase is essential for the metabolism of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. In Wolman disease, LAL activity is usually absent, whereas CESD usually presents some residual LAL activity. In infants, poor weight gain, massive hepatosplenomegaly, calcified adrenal glands (present about 2/3 of the time), vomiting, diarrhea and failure to thrive are indicative of Wolman disease. The clinical picture is more variable in CESD. Hepatomegaly and/or elevation of liver transaminases are almost always present. Hepatic steatosis often leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Other signs often include splenomegaly, high total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL-cholesterol. The diagnosis of LAL deficiency requires clinical experience and specialized laboratory tests. The diagnosis is based on finding deficient activity of acid lipase and/or molecular tests. Pilot screening projects using dried blood spot testing in 1) children with atypical fatty liver disease in the absence of overweight, 2) patients with dyslipidaemia and presence of hepatomegaly and/or elevated transaminases, 3) newborns/neonates with hepatomegaly and abdominal distension/failure to thrive/elevated transaminases are currently underway. Early diagnosis is particularly important for the enzyme replacement therapy. Human trials with recombinant LAL are currently ongoing, raising the prospect for specific correction of LAL deficiency in this progressive and often debilitating disorder.",

The key role of the enzyme in intracellular lipid homeostasis is illustrated by two lysosomal storage diseases inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Wolman disease, associated with deficient hLAL activity, leads to massive intracellular substrate accumulation and is always fatal in early infancy. Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), in contrast, is characterized by very low levels of enzymic activity sufficient to allow survival of the affected patients into adulthood. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular defects in Wolman disease, we have characterized the hLAL gene in two female Wolman patients of German and Turkish origin by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis. Our results demonstrate that the German proband was compound heterozygous for an 8-bp deletion in exon 3 and a 2-bp deletion in exon 4 of the hLAL gene. These frameshift mutations lead to protein truncation at amino acid positions 24 and 116 and to complete loss of hydrolytic activity. The Turkish proband, in contrast, was homozygous for a G(1064)--&gt;T substitution in exon 10 of the hLAL gene which converts the completely conserved glycine (GGG) residue at position 321 of the mature enzyme to tryptophan (TGG). In vitro expression of the hLAL(Gly(321)--&gt;Trp) cDNA construct revealed that the amino acid replacement results in a more than 99% reduction of neutral lipid hydrolysis. The mutations provide new insights into the molecular basis of Wolman disease which is apparently more heterogeneous at the genetic level than cholesteryl ester storage disease.-Lohse, P., S. Maas, P. Lohse, A. C. Sewell, O. P. van Diggelen, and D. Seidel. Molecular defects underlying Wolman disease appear to be more heterogeneous than those resulting in cholesteryl ester storage disease.",

We previously reported a rat model of Wolman's disease (Wolman rat) that is deficient for LAL activity. In this study, we cloned rat LAL (RLAL) cDNA and investigated abnormal LAL gene expression in the Wolman rat. We cloned the RLAL gene from a cDNA library made from normal rat liver mRNA using the human LAL cDNA as a probe, subcloned the RLAL cDNA into pBlueScript vector, and sequenced it. Next, we constructed a cDNA library from a Wolman rat liver, and used the RLAL cDNA as a probe to isolate the Wolman RLAL cDNA for comparison. The normal RLAL cDNA contains 3150 bp including an 1194 bp open reading frame and three poly A signals at the 3' end. The deduced amino acid sequence contained 397 amino acids, showed 79.9% homology with human LAL, and had the same functional domains at the same sites as human LAL. Northern blot analysis revealed that the RLAL mRNA from normal rat was 3.2 kb in length, while the RLAL mRNA from Wolman rat was only 1.4 kb. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that Wolman rat LAL cDNA had the same sequence as a RLAL cDNA from the 5'-untranslated region to nt 1101, followed by a 60 bp replacement from nt 1102 to nt 1161 with poly A signal and a 3' 1.8 kb deletion. The deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated the substitution of 367Ile to Asn, 368Pro to stop codon, and deletion of the C-terminal 29 amino acids. Genomic Southern blot analysis disclosed a large deletion at the 3' end of the gene. These results identify the molecular defect in the Wolman RLAL, and suggest that the C-terminus of RLAL is essential for the activity and/or stability of the enzyme.",

Deficiency in LAL function causes accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in lysosomes. Fatality usually occurs within the first year of life. While an enzyme replacement therapy has recently become available, there is currently no small-molecule drug treatment for WD. We have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two WD patient dermal fibroblast lines and subsequently differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs). The WD NSCs exhibited the hallmark disease phenotypes of neutral lipid accumulation, severely deficient LAL activity, and increased LysoTracker dye staining. Enzyme replacement treatment dramatically reduced the WD phenotype in these cells. In addition, \u03b4-tocopherol (DT) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) significantly reduced lysosomal size in WD NSCs, and an enhanced effect was observed in DT/HPBCD combination therapy. The results demonstrate that these WD NSCs are valid cell-based disease models with characteristic disease phenotypes that can be used to evaluate drug efficacy and screen compounds. DT and HPBCD both reduce LysoTracker dye staining in WD cells.

The strikingly more severe course of WD is caused by genetic defects of LAL that leave no residual enzymatic activity. Mutations at the exon 8/intron 8 transition of the LAL gene have been identified in several CESD and WD patients and are responsible for the manifestation of the disease. We have determined the genetic defect in a 3-month-old boy of African origin affected by WD. No enzymatic activity of the lysosomal acid lipase was detectable in white blood cells and cultured fibroblasts. Analysis of his LAL cDNA and genomic DNA revealed that he was homozygous for a mutation at position -3 of the exon 8 splice donor site. A C--&gt;T transition leads to a nonsense codon and to a premature termination of the LAL protein at amino acid 277. Due to this mutation, a shorter LAL mRNA species was also generated that lacked exon 8 and was deficient of the nonsense codon. As a consequence, the protein synthesis proceeded to the natural termination codon, but the enzyme generated had an internal deletion of 24 amino acids (254-277) and was also inactive. These findings, together with our previous observations when analyzing the mutations in WD and CESD patients lead to the conclusion that the more severe WD is due to mutations that absolutely abolish lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme activity and the cholesteryl ester storage disease phenotype is due to mutations that allow some residual LAL activity to be manifested.",

Biophys. Acta 1006, 84-88], has been administered to cultured lymphoblastoid cells from normal subjects and from a patient affected with Wolman disease, which is characterized by a deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase. The intracellular degradation of PMLes was dependent on the mode of administration of the substrate into the cells, and occurred by two separate pathways involving lysosomal and extra-lysosomal hydrolases. PMLes incorporated into LDL was taken up by normal lymphoblastoid cells through the apolipoprotein-B/E-receptor-mediated pathway and degraded in the lysosomal compartment, as suggested by the degradation block in Wolman cells. In contrast, when PMLes dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulphoxide was added directly to the culture medium, its hydrolysis was similar in lymphoblastoid cells from controls and from patients affected with Wolman disease, neutral lipid storage disease or familial hypercholesterolaemia. This suggested that the administered PMLes was degraded by a non-lysosomal enzyme which is not deficient in Wolman cells. This enzyme also differs from the neutral lipase system which is deficient in lymphoblastoid cells from patients with neutral lipid storage disease. When pyrenemethanol was administered directly to the cell culture, it was only poorly acylated and was rapidly released into the culture medium. These results and the fluorescence properties of PMLes ('monomeric' emission in a hydrophobic environment and 'excimeric' emission in a hydrophilic environment) and pyrenemethanol ('monomeric' emission in a hydrophilic environment) allowed us to design a 'direct reading' procedure by monitoring (without any lipid extraction) the fluorescence of intact living cells and that of the culture medium during pulse-chase experiments. This method allowed the direct evaluation of the time course of in situ degradation of PMLes. In pulse-chase experiments with LDL-PMLes, the fluorescence of normal cells decreased relatively rapidly with time whereas the fluorescence of the culture medium increased concomitantly. With Wolman cells, the cellular fluorescence decreased only very slightly, whereas that of the culture medium remained at the basal level; this demonstrates the catabolic block in intact living cells from patients with Wolman disease. In vitro degradation of PMLes indicated the existence of two PMLes-degrading enzymes in lymphoblastoid cell homogenates: one is the acid lipase which is involved in PMLes degradation in the lysosomal compartment (and is deficient in Wolman cells), while the second is a cytoplasmic enzyme (not deficient in Wolman cells).",

As a result, these mutant cells show a reduced responsiveness to the regulatory actions of LDL, as evidenced by a decreased LDL-mediated suppression of the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and by a decreased LDL-mediated activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. In the current studies, the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells were grown in the same Petri dish with mutant fibroblasts derived from a patient with the homozygous form of Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Whereas pure monolayers of either the Familial Hypercholesterolemia cells (lacking cell surface LDL receptors) or the acid lipase-deficient cells (lacking cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity) responded poorly to LDL, the mixed monolayers developed lipoprotein responsiveness as measured by an enhancement of both LDL-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and LDL-mediated stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation. This effect was shown to result from the release of the lysosomal acid lipase from the Familial Hypercholesterolemia homozygote cells into the culture medium and its subsequent uptake by the acid lipase-deficient cells. The acquisition of this acid lipase activity enhanced the ability of the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells to respond to the lipoprotein by suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. These data emphasize the importance of the lysosomal acid lipase in the cellular metabolism of LDL cholesteryl esters and, in addition, demonstrate that delivery of this enzyme to genetically deficient cells can enhance the regulatory response to the lipoprotein.",

In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al., Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. In this work, we proceed to investigate whether such units of three-dimensional genomic organization can be linked to transcriptional activity as a driving force for the shaping of genomic architecture. Through the application of a simple boundary-calling criterion in genome-wide 3C data, we define ~100 TAD-like domains which can be clustered in six different classes with radically different nucleosomal organizations, significant variations in transcription factor binding and uneven chromosomal distribution. Approximately ~20% of the genome is found to be confined in regions with \"closed\" chromatin structure around gene promoters. Most interestingly, we find both \"open\" and \"closed\" regions to be segregated, in the sense that they tend to avoid inter-chromosomal interactions. Our data further enforce the notion of a marked compartmentalization of the yeast genome in isolated territories, with implications in its function and evolution.",

In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins.",

Knockdown of maternal Mov10 in Xenopus embryos using a translation blocking morpholino led to defects in gastrulation and the development of notochord and paraxial mesoderm, and a failure to neurulate. RNA sequencing of the Mov10 knockdown embryos showed significant upregulation of many mRNAs when compared with controls at stage 10.5 (including those related to the cytoskeleton, adhesion, and extracellular matrix, which are involved in those morphogenetic processes). Additionally, the degradation of the miR-427 target mRNA, cyclin A1, was delayed in the Mov10 knockdowns. These defects suggest that Mov10's role in miRNA-mediated regulation of the maternal to zygotic transition could lead to pleiotropic effects that cause the gastrulation defects. Additionally, the knockdown of zygotic Mov10 showed that it was necessary for normal head, eye, and brain development in Xenopus consistent with a recent study in the mouse.

Treatments for hepatitis C virus infection have reduced non-cancer events among patients receiving liver transplants, so reducing HCC-related death might be an actionable end point. We performed a competing-risk analysis to evaluate factors associated with survival of patients with HCC and developed a prognostic model based on features of HCC patients before liver transplantation. We performed multivariable competing-risk regression analysis to identify factors associated with HCC-specific death of patients who underwent liver transplantation. The training set comprised 1018 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC from January 2000 through December 2013 at 3 tertiary centers in Italy. The validation set comprised 341 consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC during the same period at the Liver Cancer Institute in Shanghai, China. We collected pretransplantation data on etiology of liver disease, number and size of tumors, patient level of \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), model for end-stage liver disease score, tumor stage, numbers and types of treatment, response to treatments, tumor grade, microvascular invasion, dates, and causes of death. Death was defined as HCC-specific when related to HCC recurrence after transplantation, disseminated extra- and/or intrahepatic tumor relapse and worsened liver function in presence of tumor spread. The cumulative incidence of death was segregated for hepatitis C virus status. In the competing-risk regression, the sum of tumor number and size and of log<sub>10</sub> level of AFP were significantly associated with HCC-specific death (P &lt; .001), returning an average c-statistic of 0.780 (95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.798). Five-year cumulative incidence of non-HCC-related death was 8.6% in HCV-negative patients and 18.1% in HCV-positive patients.

The diagnostic criteria of CHC were defined as follows: (1) both AFP and CA19-9 are simultaneously elevated (AFP &gt; 20 ng/ml and CA19-9 &gt; 100 units/ml); or (2) elevated AFP with a CC-like pattern on CEUS and without elevated CA19-9 level; or (3) elevated CA19-9 with an HCC-like pattern on CEUS and without elevated AFP level. The diagnostic tests were performed with calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For the 40 CHC patients, the rates of elevated AFP and CA19-9 serology were 55.0 and 30.0%, respectively. Twenty-three (57.5%) patients exhibited an HCC-like pattern, and 15 (37.5%) showed a CC-like pattern. After applying the above diagnostic criteria of CHC in the 120 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and AUC were 32.5, 93.8, 72.2, 73.5, 73.3, and 0.631%, respectively. When the actual prevalence rate (0.4-14.3%) was taken into account, the PPV and NPV were modified from 2.1 to 46.7% and 89.3 to 99.7%, respectively. The combination of enhancement patterns on CEUS and serum tumor markers (AFP and CA19-9) may be a potentially specific diagnostic method to differentiate CHC from HCC and CC.",

The authors present the cases of four cousins with MDS who also carried a 16p13.3 microduplication (not associated with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome). Retinopathy of prematurity-like proliferative peripheral retinopathy (PPR) was detected in two male first cousins, but was not detected in the female half-cousins. PPR in the first infant resolved by 4 months, but the second infant's PPR progressed, requiring photocoagulation followed by lens-sparing vitrectomy. While ocular abnormalities are more prevalent and severe in other lissencephalopathies, the PPR in these MDS infants underscores the sight-saving potential of performing an ophthalmologic exam with early molecular testing for all lissencephaly infants.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29628935": "Chromosome 17p13.3 is a region of genomic instability that is linked to different rare neurodevelopmental genetic diseases, depending on whether a deletion or duplication of the region has occurred. Chromosome microdeletions within 17p13.3 can result in either isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS) or Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS). Both conditions are associated with a smooth cerebral cortex, or lissencephaly, which leads to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. However, patients with MDS have larger deletions than patients with ILS, resulting in additional symptoms such as poor muscle tone, congenital anomalies, abnormal spasticity, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. In contrast to microdeletions in 17p13.3, recent studies have attracted considerable attention to a condition known as a 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome. Depending on the genes involved in their microduplication, patients with 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome may be categorized into either class I or class II. Individuals in class I have microduplications of the <i>YWHAE</i> gene encoding 14-3-3\u03b5, as well as other genes in the region. However, the <i>PAFAH1B1</i> gene encoding LIS1 is never duplicated in these patients. Class I microduplications generally result in learning disabilities, autism, and developmental delays, among other disorders. Individuals in class II always have microduplications of the <i>PAFAH1B1</i> gene, which may include <i>YWHAE</i> and other genetic microduplications. Class II microduplications generally result in smaller body size, developmental delays, microcephaly, and other brain malformations. Here, we review the phenotypes associated with copy number variations (CNVs) of chromosome 17p13.3 and detail their developmental connection to particular microdeletions or microduplications. We also focus on existing single and double knockout mouse models that have been used to study human phenotypes, since the highly limited number of patients makes a study of these conditions difficult in humans. These models are also crucial for the study of brain development at a mechanistic level since this cannot be accomplished in humans. Finally, we emphasize the usefulness of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and next generation sequencing in the study of neurodevelopmental diseases.",

Results of SNP array were analyzed with bioinformatics software. G-banded karyotyping failed to detect any abnormalities in both fetuses and their parents.

These phenotypic changes lead to a non-cell-autonomous disturbance of the N-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin signaling axis. Reinstalling active \u03b2-catenin signaling rescues division modes and ameliorates growth defects.

Although amino acid sequence analysis and RNase protection analysis suggest a single profilin isoform in mammalian cells, Southern blot analysis of human and somatic cell hybrid DNA indicates several loci in the human genome which hybridize with the profilin cDNA. We therefore isolated human genomic clones to analyze these genetic loci in detail. Only one of the cloned loci has typical features of a functional gene, including upstream transcriptional elements and typical exon-intron structure. Four other isolated loci are all diverged, intronless pseudogenes and are likely to be nonfunctional. The functional gene was localized to human chromosome band 17p13 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ chromosomal localization. The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a rare congenital disorder manifested by characteristic facial abnormalities and lissencephaly (smooth brain), is associated with microdeletions of the distal 17p region. RFLP analysis of a patient with MDS, and analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing partially deleted chromosomes 17 from patients with MDS, using the profilin gene probe, indicate that profilin is localized to chromosome subband 17p13.3. These results also indicate that profilin is the first identified cloned gene which is part of the genetic material deleted in some patients with MDS but that other patients have smaller deletions not affecting the profilin locus. Thus, single allelic deletion of the profilin locus may contribute to the clinical phenotype of the MDS in some patients but does not play a major role in the essential phenotype.",

Using human chromosome 17-specific DNA probes, we have begun a molecular dissection of the critical region for MDS. To localize cloned DNA sequences to the MDS critical region, a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid panel was constructed which includes hybrids containing the abnormal chromosome 17 from three MDS patients with deletions of various sizes. Three genes (myosin heavy chain 2, tumor antigen p53, and RNA polymerase II) previously mapped to 17p were excluded from the MDS deletion region and therefore are unlikely to play a role in its pathogenesis. In contrast, three highly polymorphic anonymous probes, YNZ22.1 (D17S5), YNH37.3 (D17S28), and 144-D6 (D17S34), were deleted in each of four patients with visible deletions, including one with a ring chromosome 17 that is deleted for a portion of the single telomeric prometaphase subband p13.3. In two MDS patients with normal chromosomes, a combination of somatic cell hybrid, RFLP, and densitometric studies demonstrated deletion for YNZ22.1 and YNH37.3 in the paternally derived 17's of both patients, one of whom is also deleted for 144-D6. The results indicate that MDS can be caused by submicroscopic deletion and raises the possibility that all MDS patients will prove to have deletions at a molecular level. The two probes lie within a critical region of less than 3,000 kb and constitute potential starting points in the isolation of genes implicated in the severe brain maldevelopment in MDS.",

All patients, including three with normal karyotypes, are deleted for a variable set of 5-12 markers. Two highly polymorphic VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) probes, YNZ22 and YNH37, are codeleted in all patients tested and make molecular diagnosis for this disorder feasible. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, YNZ22 and YNH37 were shown to be within 30 kilobases (kb) of each other. Cosmid clones containing both VNTR sequences were identified, and restriction mapping showed them to be less than 15 kb apart. Three overlapping cosmids spanning greater than 100 kb were completely deleted in all patients, providing a minimum estimate of the size of the MDS critical region. A hypomethylated island and evolutionarily conserved sequences were identified within this 100-kb region, indications of the presence of one or more expressed sequences potentially involved in the pathophysiology of this disorder.

The phenotypic consequences of YWHAE deletion without deletion of PAFAH1B1 have not been studied systematically. We performed a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of five patients with deletions involving YWHAE but not PAFAH1B1, two with deletion including PAFAH1B1 but not YWHAE, and one with deletion of YWHAE and mosaic for deletion of PAFAH1B1. Three deletions were terminal whereas five were interstitial. Patients with deletions including YWHAE but not PAFAH1B1 presented with significant growth restriction, cognitive impairment, shared craniofacial features, and variable structural abnormalities of the brain. Growth restriction was not observed in one patient with deletion of YWHAE and TUSC5, implying that other genes in the region may have a role in regulation of growth with CRK being the most likely candidate. Using array based comparative genomic hybridisation and long range polymerase chain reaction, we have delineated the breakpoints of these nonrecurrent deletions and show that the interstitial genomic rearrangements are likely generated by diverse mechanisms, including the recently described Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS)/Microhomology Mediated Break Induced Replication (MMBIR). Microdeletions of chromosome 17p13.3 involving YWHAE present with growth restriction, craniofacial dysmorphisms, structural abnormalities of brain and cognitive impairment.

Even siblings and monozygotic twins with the same aberration are often discordant for seizure disorders. Similar observations can be made for congenital (major) malformations in chromosome aberrations. The common explanation is that in these instances epilepsy is not caused by the action of a single gene in single or triple dose, but is influenced by the combined action of a number of genes within and outside of the aneuploid segment. The situation is comparable to a polygenic model of inheritance. Gene mutations associated with epilepsy are known, to date, only for two disorders: the lissencephaly 1 gene in Miller-Dieker syndrome and mutations in the UBE3A gene in Angelman syndrome. Chromosome aberrations in which epilepsy is a major and consistent finding include Angelman syndrome due to loss of the maternal 15q11.2-q12 segment, tetrasomy of the maternal segment 15pter-q13 due to an additional inv dup chromosome, Miller-Dieker syndrome due to deletion of the 17p13.3 segment including the lissencephaly1 gene, ring chromosome 20, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome due to deletion of at least the 4p16.3 segment.",

Apparently partial and non-overlapping deletions of the 5' or 3' end of a candidate gene LIS1 in one ILS and one MDS patient had suggested that MDS was a single gene disorder, and that LIS1 spans in excess of 400 kb. However, the originally presumed 5' end of LIS1 was found to belong to the 14-33 epsilon gene residing more distally on 17p13.3. We have now isolated the correct 5' end of LIS1, constructed a approximately 500 kb genomic contig encompassing LIS1, and estimated its gene to be approximately 80 kg. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of an ILS patient with a de novo balanced translocation, as well as analysis of several other key MDS and ILS deletion patients, localizes the lissencephaly critical region within the LIS1 gene. Therefore, LIS1 remains the strongest candidate gene for the lissencephaly phenotype in ILS and MDS.

The proband presented with facial dysmorphism, arthrogryposis, and intrauterine growth retardation. Most cases of Miller-Dieker syndrome have a de novo deletion involving 17p13.3. When Miller-Dieker syndrome is caused by an unbalanced translocation, mild-to-severe phenotypes occur according to the extension of the involved partner chromosome. However, a pure partial monosomy derived from a paternal balanced translocation is relatively rare. In this case, the submicroscopic cryptic deletion in the proband was initially elucidated by FISH, and karyotype analysis did not reveal additional chromosome abnormalities such as translocation. However, a family history of recurrent pregnancy abnormalities strongly suggested familial translocation. Sequential G-banding and FISH analysis of the father's chromosomes showed that the segment of 17p13.3\u2192pter was attached to the 12qter.

Here we report on 12 patients with congenital hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia caused by <i>MECOM</i> mutations (including 10 novel mutations). The mutations affected different functional domains of the EVI1 protein. The spectrum of phenotypes was much broader than initially reported for the first 3 patients; we found familial as well as sporadic cases, and the clinical spectrum ranged from isolated radioulnar synostosis with no or mild hematological involvement to severe bone marrow failure without obvious skeletal abnormality. The clinical picture included radioulnar synostosis, bone marrow failure, clinodactyly, cardiac and renal malformations, B-cell deficiency, and presenile hearing loss. No single clinical manifestation was detected in all patients affected by <i>MECOM</i> mutations. Radioulnar synostosis and B-cell deficiency were observed only in patients with mutations affecting a short region in the C-terminal zinc finger domain of EVI1.

Its spontaneous retrotransposition and the accumulation of heritable L1 insertions can potentially result in genome instability and sporadic disorders. Moloney leukemia virus 10 homolog (MOV10), a putative RNA helicase, has been implicated in inhibiting L1 replication, although its underlying mechanism of action remains obscure. Moreover, the physiological relevance of MOV10-mediated L1 regulation in human disease has not yet been examined. Using a proteomic approach, we identified RNASEH2 as a binding partner of MOV10. We show that MOV10 interacts with RNASEH2, and their interplay is crucial for restricting L1 retrotransposition. RNASEH2 and MOV10 co-localize in the nucleus, and RNASEH2 binds to L1 RNAs in a MOV10-dependent manner. Small hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of either RNASEH2A or MOV10 results in an accumulation of L1-specific RNA-DNA hybrids, suggesting they contribute to prevent formation of vital L1 heteroduplexes during retrotransposition. Furthermore, we show that RNASEH2-MOV10-mediated L1 restriction downregulates expression of the rheumatoid arthritis-associated inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading proteinases in synovial cells, implicating a potential causal relationship between them and disease development in terms of disease predisposition.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21931534": "Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. CD28 is a homodimer expressed on T cells that functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through an interaction with its B7 coligands, yet we show here that to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity, superantigens must bind directly into the dimer interface of CD28. Preventing access of the superantigen to CD28 suffices to block its lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superantigen challenge by short peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer interface and by peptides selected to compete with the superantigen for its binding site in CD28. Superantigens use a conserved \u03b2-strand/hinge/\u03b1-helix domain of hitherto unknown function to engage CD28. Mutation of this superantigen domain abolished inflammatory cytokine gene induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed that when a superantigen binds to the T cell receptor on the T cell and major histocompatibility class II molecule on the antigen-presenting cell, CD28 can be accommodated readily as third superantigen receptor in the quaternary complex, with the CD28 dimer interface oriented towards the \u03b2-strand/hinge/\u03b1-helix domain in the superantigen. Our findings identify the CD28 homodimer interface as a critical receptor target for superantigens. The novel role of CD28 as receptor for a class of microbial pathogens, the superantigen toxins, broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms.",

We show that to elicit an inflammatory cytokine storm and lethality, superantigens must bind directly to CD28. Blocking access of the superantigen to its CD28 receptor with peptides mimicking the contact domains in either toxin or CD28 suffices to protect mice effectively from lethal shock.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404186": "During severe bacterial infections, death and disease are often caused by an overly strong immune response of the human host. Acute toxic shock is induced by superantigen toxins, a diverse set of proteins secreted by Gram-positive staphylococcal and streptococcal bacterial strains that overstimulate the inflammatory response by orders of magnitude. The need to protect from superantigen toxins led to our discovery that in addition to the well-known MHC class II and T cell receptors, the principal costimulatory receptor, CD28, and its constitutively expressed coligand, B7-2 (CD86), previously thought to have only costimulatory function, are actually critical superantigen receptors. Binding of the superantigen into the homodimer interfaces of these costimulatory receptors greatly enhances B7-2/CD28 engagement, leading to excessive pro-inflammatory signaling. This finding led to the design of short receptor dimer interface mimetic peptides that block the binding of superantigen and thus protect from death. It then turned out that such a peptide will protect also from Gram-negative bacterial infection and from polymicrobial sepsis. One such CD28 mimetic peptide is advancing in a Phase 3 clinical trial to protect from lethal wound infections by flesh-eating bacteria. These host-oriented therapeutics target the human immune system itself, rendering pathogens less likely to become resistant.",

The present study was aimed at identifying possible interactions between different bacteria isolated from the same chronic wound of a patient with the genetic blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Specifically, this involved two different isolates of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, and isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis and Klebsiella oxytoca. Particular focus was attributed to interactions of S. aureus with the two other species, because of the high staphylococcal prevalence among chronic wounds. Intriguingly, upon co-cultivation, none of the wound isolates inhibited each other's growth. Since the extracellular proteome of bacterial pathogens is a reservoir of virulence factors, the exoproteomes of the staphylococcal isolates in monoculture and co-culture with B. thuringiensis and K. oxytoca were characterized by Mass Spectrometry to explore the inherent relationships between these co-exisiting bacteria. This revealed a massive reduction in the number of staphylococcal exoproteins upon co-culturing with K. oxytoca or B. thuringiensis. Interestingly, this decrease was particularly evident for extracellular proteins with a predicted cytoplasmic localization, which were recently implicated in staphylococcal virulence and epidemiology. Furthermore, our exoproteome analysis uncovered potential cooperativity between the two different S. aureus isolates. Altogether, the observed exoproteome variations upon co-culturing are indicative of unprecedented adaptive mechanisms that set limits to the production of secreted staphylococcal virulence factors.",

Targeted deletion of two SNARE-encoding genes in V. dahliae, VdSec22 and VdSso1, significantly reduced virulence of both mutants on cotton, relative to the wild-type Vd991 strain. Comparative analyses of the secreted protein content (exoproteome) revealed that many enzymes involved in carbohydrate hydrolysis were regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1. Consistent with a role of these enzymes in plant cell-wall degradation, pectin, cellulose, and xylan utilization were reduced in the VdSec22 or VdSso1 mutant strains along with a loss of exoproteome cytotoxic activity on cotton leaves. Comparisons with a pathogenicity-related exoproteome revealed that several known virulence factors were not regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1, but some of the proteins regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1 displayed different characteristics, including the lack of a typical signal peptide, suggesting that V. dahliae employs more than one secretory route to transport proteins to extracellular sites during infection.",

Between 2006 and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the AAAS gene.

It occurs due to biallelic mutations in the AAAS gene which codes for the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A number of other features have been reported over time in this heterogeneous and multisystemic disorder. Unlike other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members harboring the same mutation(s). A gene-environment interaction has been thought to be a plausible cause. Methods A retrospective analysis of six families and seven patients presenting with triple A syndrome was carried out. The clinical, biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious hyperpigmentation and delayed development. Neurological and autonomic features were present in a few patients, suggesting requirement of prolonged follow-up for these patients. A significant gap between the onset of symptoms and confirmatory diagnosis was noted, suggesting that a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing this disorder. Sudden unexplained death was observed in siblings, and early diagnosis and treatment could help in preventing early mortality and improving the quality of life for these patients.

The triple A syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene, which encodes a protein known as ALADIN (ALacrima Achalasia aDrenal Insufficiency Neurologic disorder). ALADIN is a new WD-repeat protein that has no significant homology to any previously identified WD-repeat protein. It has been shown that it colocalizes with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), a finding that strongly suggests an involvement of ALADIN in nucleocytoplasmic transport. An investigation of 110 families with triple A syndrome disclosed mutation hot spots including Q15K (exon 1), and S293P (exon 8), which occur in 17 and 21 families from different geographical regions, respectively. The variable phenotype of all patients cannot be correlated with the localization and the nature of the ALADIN mutations. Thus, modifying genes/factors may be involved in the progression of this neurodegenerative disease. The lack of AAAS mutations in eight patients and negative linkage to chromosome 12q13 in three families are suggestive of genetic heterogeneity. To examine the cellular localization of ALADIN mutants causing triple A syndrome, we investigated nine different ALADIN-mutants: 2 nonsense (W84X, Q456X), 2 frameshift (F157fsX171, G397fsX414) and 5 point mutations (Q15K, L25P, H160R, S263P, L381R) by transfection experiments with green fluorescence protein. Mutants were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, but also found in the nucleus indicating that ALADIN is essential for NPC targeting. To investigate physiological functions of ALADIN in vivo, we generated and analysed Aaas-/- knockout mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, required animals lack any gross abnormality in adrenal and nervous system function. Further studies have to investigate the role of ALADIN at NPCs and to identify interacting proteins.

The triple A gene was identified recently at this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract. Those bearing mutations had the classical triple A syndrome of achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a progressive neurological syndrome. We identified a spectrum of associated neurological abnormalities in these cases, including pupil and cranial nerve abnormalities, frequent optic atrophy, autonomic neuropathy and upper and lower motor neurone signs including distal motor neuropathy and amyotrophy with severe selective ulnar nerve involvement. In these families, we have made genotype-phenotype correlations. Mutations in the triple A gene are thus an important cause of this clinically heterogeneous syndrome, and sequencing represents an important diagnostic investigation.

Recently developed small molecule PKD inhibitors, CID755673 and CRT0066101, provide potentially important pharmacological approaches to further investigate the effect of PKD in pancreatitis therapy. The aim of this study was to explore whether CID755673 and CRT0066101 block NF-\u03baB activation with <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of experimental pancreatitis and whether the small molecule PKD inhibitors have therapeutic effects when given before or after the initiation of experimental pancreatitis. Freshly prepared pancreatic acini were incubated with CID755673 or CRT006101, followed by hyperstimulation with CCK or CCh. For <i>in vivo</i> experimental pancreatitis, rats were treated with intraperitoneal injection of CID755673 or CRT0066101 prior to or after administering cerulein or saline.

Our results showed that both CID755673 or CRT0066101 selectively and specifically inhibited PKD without effects on related protein kinase Cs. Inhibition of PKD resulted in significantly attenuation of NF-\u03baB activation in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of experimental pancreatitis. NF-\u03baB inhibition by CID755673 was associated with decreased inflammatory responses and attenuated severity of the disease, which were indicated by less inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced pancreatic interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), decreased intrapancreatic trypsin activation, and alleviation in pancreatic necrosis, edema and vacuolization. Furthermore, PKD inhibitor CID755673, given after the initiation of pancreatitis in experimental rat model, significantly attenuated the severity of acute pancreatitis. Therapies for acute pancreatitis are limited. Our results indicate that small chemical PKD inhibitors have significant potential as therapeutic interventions by suppressing NF-\u03baB activation.",

CRT0066101, an inhibitor of PKD, has antitumor activity in multiple types of carcinomas. However, the effect and mechanism of CRT0066101 in bladder cancer are not understood. In the present study, we show that CRT0066101 suppressed the proliferation and migration of four bladder cancer cell lines in vitro. We also demonstrate that CRT0066101 blocked tumor growth in a mouse flank xenograft model of bladder cancer. To further assess the role of PKD in bladder carcinoma, we examined the three PKD isoforms and found that PKD2 was highly expressed in eight bladder cancer cell lines and in urothelial carcinoma tissues from the TCGA database, and that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of PKD2 dramatically reduced bladder cancer growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the effect of the compound in bladder cancer is mediated through inhibition of PKD2. This notion was corroborated by demonstrating that the levels of phospho-PKD2 were markedly decreased in CRT0066101-treated bladder tumor explants. Furthermore, our cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry revealed that CRT0066101 treatment or PKD2 silencing arrested bladder cancer cells at the G2/M phase, the arrest being accompanied by decreases in the levels of cyclin B1, CDK1 and phospho-CDK1 (Thr161) and increases in the levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and phospho-CDK1 (Thr14/Tyr15). Moreover, CRT0066101 downregulated the expression of Cdc25C, which dephosphorylates/activates CDK1, but enhanced the activity of the checkpoint kinase Chk1, which inhibits CDK1 by phosphorylating/inactivating Cdc25C. Finally, CRT0066101 was found to elevate the levels of Myt1, Wee1, phospho-Cdc25C (Ser216), Gadd45\u03b1, and 14-3-3 proteins, all of which reduce the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex activity. These novel findings suggest that CRT0066101 suppresses bladder cancer growth by inhibiting PKD2 through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest, leading to the blockade of cell cycle progression.",

The mechanisms by which agonists stimulate mobilization and plasma membrane translocation of G protein-coupled receptors from intracellular stores are unexplored. Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) traffics to lysosomes, and sustained protease signaling requires mobilization and plasma membrane trafficking of PAR2 from Golgi stores. We evaluated the contribution of protein kinase D (PKD) and G\u03b2\u03b3 to this process. In HEK293 and KNRK cells, the PAR2 agonists trypsin and 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2 activated PKD in the Golgi apparatus, where PKD regulates protein trafficking. PAR2 activation induced translocation of G\u03b2\u03b3, a PKD activator, to the Golgi apparatus, determined by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between G\u03b3-Venus and giantin-Rluc8. Inhibitors of PKD (CRT0066101) and G\u03b2\u03b3 (gallein) prevented PAR2-stimulated activation of PKD. CRT0066101, PKD1 siRNA, and gallein all inhibited recovery of PAR2-evoked Ca(2+) signaling. PAR2 with a photoconvertible Kaede tag was expressed in KNRK cells to examine receptor translocation from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Irradiation of the Golgi region (405 nm) induced green-red photo-conversion of PAR2-Kaede. Trypsin depleted PAR2-Kaede from the Golgi apparatus and repleted PAR2-Kaede at the plasma membrane. CRT0066101 inhibited PAR2-Kaede translocation to the plasma membrane. CRT0066101 also inhibited sustained protease signaling to colonocytes and nociceptive neurons that naturally express PAR2 and mediate protease-evoked inflammation and nociception. Our results reveal a major role for PKD and G\u03b2\u03b3 in agonist-evoked mobilization of intracellular PAR2 stores that is required for sustained signaling by extracellular proteases.",

The most aggressive cases of IDC are characterized by a high proliferation rate, a great propensity to metastasize, and their ability to resist to standard chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or HER2-targeted therapy. Using progression tissue microarrays, we here demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase D3 (PKD3) is highly upregulated in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (ER(-)) tumors. We identify direct binding of the ER to the PRKD3 gene promoter as a mechanism of inhibition of PKD3 expression. Loss of ER results in upregulation of PKD3, leading to all hallmarks of aggressive IDC, including increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This identifies ER(-) breast cancers as ideal for treatment with the PKD inhibitor CRT0066101. We show that similar to a knockdown of PKD3, treatment with this inhibitor targets all tumorigenic processes in vitro and decreases growth of primary tumors and metastasis in vivo. Our data strongly support the development of PKD inhibitors for clinical use for ER(-) breast cancers, including the triple-negative phenotype.",

Protein kinase D (PKD/PKD1) is a convergent point of PKC \u03b4 and \u03b5 in the signaling pathways triggered through CCK or cholinergic receptors and has been shown to activate the transcription factor NF-\u03baB in acute pancreatitis. For the present study we hypothesized that a newly developed PKD/PKD1 inhibitor, CRT0066101, would prevent the initial events leading to pancreatitis. We pretreated isolated rat pancreatic acinar cells with CRT0066101 and a commercially available inhibitor G\u00f66976 (10 \u03bcM). This was followed by stimulation for 60 min with high concentrations of cholecystokinin (CCK, 0.1 \u03bcM), carbachol (CCh, 1 mM), or bombesin (10 \u03bcM) to induce initial events of pancreatitis. PKD/PKD1 phosphorylation and activity were measured as well as zymogen activation, amylase secretion, cell injury and NF-\u03baB activation. CRT0066101 dose dependently inhibited secretagogue-induced PKD/PKD1 activation and autophosphorylation at Ser-916 with an IC(50) \u223c3.75-5 \u03bcM but had no effect on PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the PKD/PKD1 activation loop (Ser-744/748). Furthermore, CRT0066101 reduced secretagogue-induced zymogen activation and amylase secretion. G\u00f66976 reduced zymogen activation but not amylase secretion. Neither inhibitor affected basal zymogen activation or secretion. CRT0066101 did not affect secretagogue-induced cell injury or changes in cell morphology, but it reduced NF-\u03baB activation by 75% of maximal for CCK- and CCh-stimulated acinar cells. In conclusion, CRT0066101 is a potent and specific PKD family inhibitor. Furthermore, PKD/PKD1 is a potential mediator of zymogen activation, amylase secretion, and NF-\u03baB activation induced by a range of secretagogues in pancreatic acinar cells.",

However, nothing is known about the effects of targeting PKD in pancreatic cancer. Our PKD inhibitor discovery program identified CRT0066101 as a specific inhibitor of all PKD isoforms. The aim of our study was to determine the effects of CRT0066101 in pancreatic cancer. Initially, we showed that autophosphorylated PKD1 and PKD2 (activated PKD1/2) are significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer and that PKD1/2 are expressed in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines. Using Panc-1 as a model system, we showed that CRT0066101 reduced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation; increased apoptosis; blocked neurotensin-induced PKD1/2 activation; reduced neurotensin-induced, PKD-mediated Hsp27 phosphorylation; attenuated PKD1-mediated NF-kappaB activation; and abrogated the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent proliferative and prosurvival proteins. We showed that CRT0066101 given orally (80 mg/kg/d) for 24 days significantly abrogated pancreatic cancer growth in Panc-1 subcutaneous xenograft model. Activated PKD1/2 expression in the treated tumor explants was significantly inhibited with peak tumor concentration (12 micromol/L) of CRT0066101 achieved within 2 hours after oral administration. Further, we showed that CRT0066101 given orally (80 mg/kg/d) for 21 days in Panc-1 orthotopic model potently blocked tumor growth in vivo. CRT0066101 significantly reduced Ki-67-positive proliferation index (P &lt; 0.01), increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive apoptotic cells (P &lt; 0.05), and abrogated the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent proteins including cyclin D1, survivin, and cIAP-1.

Exposure to a high glucose concentration has recently been shown to increase phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser(485/491) of its \u03b11/\u03b12 subunit; however, the mechanism by which it does so is not known. Diacylglycerol (DAG), which is also increased in muscle exposed to high glucose, activates a number of signaling molecules including protein kinase (PK)C and PKD1. We sought to determine whether PKC or PKD1 is involved in inhibition of AMPK by causing Ser(485/491) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were treated with the PKC/D1 activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which acts as a DAG mimetic. This caused dose- and time-dependent increases in AMPK Ser(485/491) phosphorylation, which was associated with a \u223c60% decrease in AMPK\u03b12 activity. Expression of a phosphodefective AMPK\u03b12 mutant (S491A) prevented the PMA-induced reduction in AMPK activity. Serine phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPK activity were partially prevented by the broad PKC inhibitor G\u00f66983 and fully prevented by the specific PKD1 inhibitor CRT0066101. Genetic knockdown of PKD1 also prevented Ser(485/491) phosphorylation of AMPK. Inhibition of previously identified kinases that phosphorylate AMPK at this site (Akt, S6K, and ERK) did not prevent these events. PMA treatment also caused impairments in insulin-signaling through Akt, which were prevented by PKD1 inhibition. Finally, recombinant PKD1 phosphorylated AMPK\u03b12 at Ser(491) in cell-free conditions. These results identify PKD1 as a novel upstream kinase of AMPK\u03b12 Ser(491) that plays a negative role in insulin signaling in muscle cells.",

Protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) functions as a key regulator of many cellular processes and is downregulated in invasive breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that PRKD1 was upregulated in MCF-7-ADR human breast cancer cells characterized by drug resistance. Additionally, we discovered that PRKD1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-34a binding to the PRKD1 3'-UTR. PRKD1 expression increased following performance of a tumorsphere formation assay in MCF-7-ADR cells. We also found that reduction of PRKD1 by ectopic miR-34a expression or PRKD1 siRNA treatment resulted in suppressed self-renewal ability in breast cancer stem cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that the PRKD1 inhibitor CRT0066101 reduced phosphorylated PKD/PKC\u03bc, leading to suppression of breast cancer stemness through GSK3/\u03b2-catenin signaling. PRKD1 inhibition also influenced apoptosis initiation in MCF-7-ADR cells. Tumors from nude mice treated with miR-34a or CRT0066101 showed suppressed tumor growth, proliferation, and induced apoptosis.

Activation of the TNF-R1 receptor results in the cleavage of BID into truncated BID (tBID), which translocates to the mitochondria and induces the activation of BAX or BAK. In TNF-alpha-activated FL5.12 cells, tBID becomes part of a 45-kDa cross-linkable mitochondrial complex. Here we describe the biochemical purification of this complex and the identification of mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (Mtch2) as part of this complex. Mtch2 is a conserved protein that is similar to members of the mitochondrial carrier protein family. Our studies with mouse liver mitochondria indicate that Mtch2 is an integral membrane protein exposed on the surface of mitochondria. Using blue-native gel electrophoresis we revealed that in viable FL5.12 cells Mtch2 resides in a protein complex of ca. 185 kDa and that the addition of TNF-alpha to these cells leads to the recruitment of tBID and BAX to this complex. Importantly, this recruitment was partially inhibited in FL5.12 cells stably expressing BCL-X(L). These results implicate Mtch2 as a mitochondrial target of tBID and raise the possibility that the Mtch2-resident complex participates in the mitochondrial apoptotic program.",

BH3-only proteins such as tBID, together with lipids of the MOM, are thought to play a key role in BAX and BAK activation. In particular, cardiolipin (CL) has been shown to stimulate tBID-induced BAX activation in vitro. However, it is still unclear whether this process also relies on CL in the cell, or whether it is more dependent on MTCH2, a proposed receptor for tBID present in the MOM. To address this issue, we deleted both alleles of cardiolipin synthase in human HCT116 cells by homologous recombination, which resulted in a complete absence of CL. The CL-deficient cells were fully viable in glucose but displayed impaired oxidative phosphorylation and an inability to grow in galactose. Using these cells, we found that CL was not required for either tBID-induced BAX activation, or for apoptosis in response to treatment with TRAIL. Downregulation of MTCH2 in HCT116 cells also failed to prevent recruitment of tBID to mitochondria in apoptotic conditions. However, when both CL and MTCH2 were depleted, a significant reduction in tBID recruitment was observed, suggesting that in HCT116 cells, CL and MTCH2 can have redundant functions in this process.",

MOAP-1 is a Bax-binding protein enriched at the OMM. Here, we show that MOAP-1-deficient mice are resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis and lethality. In the absence of MOAP-1, mitochondrial accumulation of tBid is markedly impaired. MOAP-1 binds to MTCH2, and this interaction appears necessary for MTCH2 to engage tBid.

Sequence analysis shows that MTCH2 is present in all examined multicellular Metazoa as well as unicellular Choanoflagellata, and is a highly derived member of the mitochondrial carrier family. Mitochondrial carriers are monomeric transport proteins that are usually found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they exchange small substrates between the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space. There are extensive differences between the protein sequences of MTCH2 and other mitochondrial carriers that may explain the ability of MTCH2 to associate with tBID and thus its role in apoptosis. We review the experimental evidence for the role of MTCH2 in apoptosis and suggest that the original transport function of the ancestral MTCH2 mitochondrial carrier has been co-opted by the apoptotic machinery to provide a receptor and signaling mechanism.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21956758": "Rhombencephalitis (RE) is a syndrome of multiple causes and multiple outcomes. Most authors now use the terms \"rhombencephalitis\" and \"brainstem encephalitis\" interchangeably even though anatomically they are slightly different. The etiologic categories of RE include infections, autoimmune diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS). Listeria is the most common cause of infectious RE. Listeria RE primary occurs in healthy young adults. It usually occurs as a biphasic time course with a flu-like syndrome followed by brainstem dysfunction; 75% of patients have a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and almost 100% have an abnormal brain MRI scan. Positive CSF and blood cultures are the most specific for diagnosis. Treatment primarily is with ampicillin. Enterovirus 71 is probably the second most common infectious cause of RE; however, 95% of cases have occurred in the Asian-Pacific region and there is no specific treatment. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the third most common infectious cause of RE, and about 80% of cases are caused by HSV1 and 20% by HSV2. About 50% only had involvement of the brainstem whereas the other 50% also had supratentorial involvement of the temporal and frontal lobes. Mortality with acyclovir treatment was 22% versus those not on acyclovir 75%. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) have caused a few cases. The most common autoimmune etiology is Beh\u00e7et disease. Over 90% of those with Beh\u00e7et RE had abnormal MRI scans and 94% had a CSF pleocytosis. Treatment is with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, but only 25% have complete recovery. Paraneoplastic causes are the third category of RE. Brain MRIs are usually normal; there is usually a CSF pleocytosis but the protein is usually normal. Often anti-neuronal antibodies can be found. Prognosis is poor and treatment is only partially beneficial. Because Listeria and HSV are the most common treatable acute causes of RE, we recommend empiric therapy with ampicillin and acyclovir for all cases after samples have been obtained from CSF and blood for cultures and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibiotics can be changed based upon MRI, culture results, PCR results, and antibody studies.",

There are very few reports available, where expressions of sirtuin isoforms are comprehensively analyzed during neoplasia. Therefore, in the present study, the expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7 during different stages of cervical cancer progression was analyzed. The normal cervical epithelium showed feeble expression of sirtuin isoforms, SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7. A significant increase in SIRT1 expression was noted in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of proliferative layers of cervical epithelium in squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL); however, in the squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), a heterogeneous pattern of SIRT1 expression varying from low to high was noted. A progressive increase in the expression of both SIRT2 and SIRT7 was noted during cancer progression in the following order: normal &lt; preneoplasia &lt; cancer. Cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, showed higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in comparison to the immortalized cell counterpart, HaCaT. Specific inhibitors of SIRT1 (Ex527) and SIRT2 (AGK2) impaired the growth of the cervical cancer cells, SiHa, but not of the HaCaT cells. SIRT1 inhibition caused cell death, while SIRT2 inhibition resulted in cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, we report the overexpression of SIRT2 and SIRT7 proteins in cervical cancer and suggest probable application of sirtuin inhibitors as therapeutic targets. Further, a specific increase in the levels of SIRT1 in intraepithelial lesion makes it a promising candidate for identification of preneoplastic changes.",

Recently, it was demonstrated by quantitative mass spectrometry that RhoGDI\u03b1 is heavily targeted by post-translational lysine acetylation. For one site in its N-terminal domain, namely K52, we reported earlier that acetylation completely switches off RhoGDI\u03b1 function. Herein we show that K52-acetylated RhoGDI\u03b1 is specifically deacetylated by the sirtuin deacetylase Sirt2. We show that acetylation at K52 decelerates cervical cancer cell proliferation, suggesting RhoGDI\u03b1 acetylation to be a promising therapeutic target. We demonstrate that treatment of cervical cancer cells with a RhoGDI\u03b1-derived K52-trifluoroacetylated, substrate-derived peptidic sirtuin inhibitor severely impairs cell proliferation. Finally, we conclude that the potency of substrate-derived sirtuin inhibitors depends on structural features, the substrate-derived amino acid sequence as a determinant for selectivity, as well as the presence of an acetyl-lysine analogue to increase its potency. These data reveal a prospective therapeutic potential for novel substrate-derived sirtuin inhibitors.",

Clinical studies show calcitonin gene-related peptide levels correlate with migraine attacks, and decreases in this neuropeptide can indicate antimigraine therapy effectiveness. Research has revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing unmet medical need of patients. Triptans have offered some clinical benefit, but many patients do not respond and these drugs have important safety considerations. Initial calcitonin gene-related peptide-focused research led to development of the \"gepant\" small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. Positive efficacy reports concerning the gepants have been tempered by safety findings which led to the discontinuation of some of these agents. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab).

Methods Patients enrolled in a phase 3, 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of once-monthly erenumab 70 and 140 mg for migraine prevention (STRIVE) used an eDiary during the baseline and double-blind treatment phases to complete validated, specific questionnaires, including the modified (monthly) Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire; Headache Impact Test; and Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire-role function-restrictive (MSQ-RFR), -role function-preventive (MSQ-RFP), and -emotional function (MSQ-EF). Results A total of 955 patients were randomized to receive erenumab 70 mg (n = 317), erenumab 140 mg (n = 319), or placebo (n = 319). Erenumab versus placebo resulted in significantly greater improvements in all patient-reported outcomes; changes from baseline were numerically higher with 140 mg erenumab. Improvements occurred rapidly and were maintained over 6 months of treatment. Between-group differences from placebo over months 4-6 for the 70- and 140-mg dose groups were, respectively, -2.1 and -2.8 for modified (monthly) Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire, -2.1 and -2.3 for Headache Impact Test, 5.1 and 6.5 for MSQ-RFR, 4.2 and 5.4 for MSQ-RFP, and 5.2 and 6.7 for MSQ-EF ( p &lt; 0.001 for all). Erenumab also significantly reduced the proportion of patients with severe and very severe migraine-related disability and increased the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvements in migraine-related impact and health-related quality of life. Conclusion Erenumab reduced migraine disability and impact and improved patients' health-related quality of life, reinforcing its role as a promising new therapy for migraine prevention.",

We wanted to explore a possible association between individual efficacy of anti-CGRP treatment and susceptibility to migraine induction by CGRP. Thirteen migraine patients, previously enrolled in erenumab anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody trials, received CGRP in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design to investigate their susceptibility to migraine induction. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess the efficacy of previous antibody treatment. The patients were stratified into groups of high responders and poor responders. Primary outcomes were incidence of migraine-like attacks and area under the curve of headache intensity after infusion of CGRP and placebo. All interviews and experiments were performed in laboratories at the Danish Headache Center, Copenhagen, Denmark. Ten high responders and three poor responders were included. CGRP induced migraine-like attacks in ten (77%) patients, whereof two were poor responders, compared to none after placebo (p = 0.002). The area under the curve for headache intensity was greater after CGRP, compared to placebo, at 0-90 min (p = 0.009), and 2-12 h (p = 0.014). The median peak headache intensity score was 5 (5-9) after CGRP, compared to 2 (0-4) after placebo (p = 0.004). Patients with an excellent effect of erenumab are highly susceptible to CGRP provocation. If an association is evident, CGRP provocation could prove a biomarker for predicting antibody treatment efficacy.

The proportion of cases attributable to recessive coding variants was 3.6% in patients of European ancestry, compared with 50% explained by de novo coding mutations. It was higher (31%) in patients with Pakistani ancestry, owing to elevated autozygosity. Half of this recessive burden is attributable to known genes. We identified two genes not previously associated with recessive developmental disorders, <i>KDM5B</i> and <i>EIF3F</i>, and functionally validated them with mouse and cellular models.

Many disease-associated sequence variations are enriched in super-enhancer regions of disease-relevant cell types. Thus, super-enhancers can be used as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Current studies have identified super-enhancers in more than 100 cell types and demonstrated their functional importance. However, a centralized resource to integrate all these findings is not currently available. We developed dbSUPER (http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/dbsuper/), the first integrated and interactive database of super-enhancers, with the primary goal of providing a resource for assistance in further studies related to transcriptional control of cell identity and disease. dbSUPER provides a responsive and user-friendly web interface to facilitate efficient and comprehensive search and browsing. The data can be easily sent to Galaxy instances, GREAT and Cistrome web-servers for downstream analysis, and can also be visualized in the UCSC genome browser where custom tracks can be added automatically. The data can be downloaded and exported in variety of formats. Furthermore, dbSUPER lists genes associated with super-enhancers and also links to external databases such as GeneCards, UniProt and Entrez. dbSUPER also provides an overlap analysis tool to annotate user-defined regions.

In addition to acetyl groups, deacetylases can remove other acyl modifications on lysines, the roles and regulation of which are far less understood. A peptide-based fluorescent probe for single-reagent, real-time detection of deacetylase activity that can be readily adapted for probing broader lysine deacylation, including decrotonylation, is reported. Following cleavage of the lysine modification, the probe undergoes rapid intramolecular imine formation that results in marked optical changes, thus enabling convenient detection of deacylase activity with good statistical Z' factors for both absorption and fluorescence modalities. The peptide-based design offers broader isozyme scope than that of small-molecule analogues, and is suitable for probing both metal- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup> )-dependent deacetylases. With an effective sirtuin activity assay in hand, it is demonstrated that iron chelation by Sirtinol, a commonly employed sirtuin inhibitor, results in an enhancement in the inhibitory activity of the compound that may affect its performance in vivo.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330215": " Heart failure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities of the failing myocardium coupled with an energy-depleted state and cardiac remodeling. The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium. Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in rodent models of SIRT3<sup>-/-</sup>and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured. In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated metabolic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3'-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA-mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial respiration.SIRT3<sup>-/-</sup> and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity. Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy metabolism.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29659581": "The evolutionarily-conserved sirtuin family of histone deacetylases regulates a multitude of DNA-associated processes. A recent genome-wide screen conducted in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified Yku70/80, which regulate nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and telomere structure, as being essential for cell proliferation in the presence of the pan-sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM). Here, we show that sirtuin-dependent deacetylation of both histone H3 lysine 56 and H4 lysine 16 promotes growth of yku70\u0394 and yku80\u0394 cells, and that the NAM sensitivity of these mutants is not caused by defects in DNA double-strand break repair by NHEJ, but rather by their inability to maintain normal telomere length. Indeed, our results indicate that in the absence of sirtuin activity, cells with abnormally short telomeres, e.g., yku70/80\u0394 or est1/2\u0394 mutants, present striking defects in S phase progression. Our data further suggest that early firing of replication origins at short telomeres compromises the cellular response to NAM- and genotoxin-induced replicative stress. Finally, we show that reducing H4K16ac in yku70\u0394 cells limits activation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Rad53 in response to replicative stress, which promotes usage of translesion synthesis and S phase progression. Our results reveal a novel interplay between sirtuin-mediated regulation of chromatin structure and telomere-regulating factors in promoting timely completion of S phase upon replicative stress.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254776": "Lysine acetylation is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that occurs on thousands of lysine residues in diverse organisms from bacteria to humans. Accurate measurement of acetylation stoichiometry on a proteome-wide scale remains challenging. Most methods employ a comparison of chemically acetylated peptides to native acetylated peptides, however, the potentially large differences in abundance between these peptides presents a challenge for accurate quantification. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the most widely used quantitative proteomic methods. Here we show that serial dilution of SILAC-labeled peptides (SD-SILAC) can be used to identify accurately quantified peptides and to estimate the quantification error rate. We applied SD-SILAC to determine absolute acetylation stoichiometry in exponentially-growing and stationary-phase wild-type and Sirtuin deacetylase CobB-deficient cells. To further analyze CobB-regulated sites under conditions of globally increased or decreased acetylation, we measured stoichiometry in phophotransacetylase (<i>pta</i>\u0394) and acetate kinase (<i>ackA</i>\u0394) mutant strains in the presence and absence of the Sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide. We measured acetylation stoichiometry at 3,669 unique sites and found that the vast majority of acetylation occurred at a low stoichiometry. Manipulations that cause increased nonenzymatic acetylation by acetyl-phosphate (AcP), such as stationary-phase arrest and deletion of <i>ackA</i>, resulted in globally increased acetylation stoichiometry. Comparison to relative quantification under the same conditions validated our stoichiometry estimates at hundreds of sites, demonstrating the accuracy of our method. Similar to Sirtuin deacetylase 3 (SIRT3) in mitochondria, CobB suppressed acetylation to lower than median stoichiometry in WT, <i>pta</i>\u0394, and <i>ackA</i>\u0394 cells. Together, our results provide a detailed view of acetylation stoichiometry in <i>E. coli</i> and suggest an evolutionarily conserved function of Sirtuin deacetylases in suppressing low stoichiometry acetylation.",

This study developed a novel sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) inhibitor (LC-0296) and examined its role in altering HNSCC tumorigenesis. The effect of the SIRT3 inhibitor, LC-0296, on cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species levels in HNSCC cells were studied. LC-0296 reduces cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis of HNSCC cells but not of normal human oral keratinocytes. This inhibitory effect is mediated, in part, via modulation of reactive oxygen species levels. Additionally, LC-0296 works synergistically to increase the sensitivity of HNSCC cells to radiation and cisplatin treatment. Development of novel SIRT3 inhibitors, such as LC-0296, might enable the development of new targeted therapies to treat and improve the survival rate of patients with head and neck cancer.",

This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant. To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task. Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F<sub>1</sub> (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams. Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text. The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.",

Existing primary immunodeficiency registries are tailored to transplantation outcomes and do not capture the breadth of safety and efficacy endpoints required by the EMA for the long-term monitoring of gene therapies. Furthermore, for extended monitoring of Strimvelis, the young age of children treated, small patient numbers, and broad geographic distribution of patients all increase the risk of loss to follow-up before sufficient data have been collected. Establishing individual investigator sites would be impractical and uneconomical owing to the small number of patients from each location receiving Strimvelis. An observational registry has been established to monitor the safety and effectiveness of Strimvelis in up to 50 patients over a minimum of 15 years. To address the potential challenges highlighted above, data will be collected by a single investigator site at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), Milan, Italy, and entered into the registry via a central electronic platform. Patients/families and the patient's local physician will also be able to submit healthcare information directly to the registry using a uniquely designed electronic platform. Data entry will be monitored by a Gene Therapy Registry Centre (funded by GlaxoSmithKline) who will ensure that necessary information is collected and flows between OSR, the patient/family and the patient's local healthcare provider. The Strimvelis registry sets a precedent for the safety monitoring of future gene therapies. A unique, patient-focused design has been implemented to address the challenges of long-term follow-up of patients treated with gene therapy for a rare disease. Strategies to ensure data completeness and patient retention in the registry will help fulfil pharmacovigilance requirements.

The New Mexico Department of Health school-based health centers (SBHCs) universally administer a validated screen, the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble), for adolescent substance use concerns; however, quality assurance efforts revealed that SBHC providers needed more information at the point of screening to initiate brief interventions for students with positive CRAFFT screens. The CHISPA (Cocaine, Heroin, IV drugs, Synthetic pot, Pot, Alcohol) was developed to gather specific information on recent substance use experience to guide brief interventions. This paper describes the development and initial reliability and validity of data obtained using the CHISPA instrument. In 2015, 99 high school-aged SBHC users in Albuquerque, New Mexico, completed the CRAFFT and CHISPA twice over 2 weeks using standard test-retest methods. Using the CHISPA, students reported for the prior 3 months substances used, frequency of use, and signs of addiction or acute danger (adverse events). Retest reliability for the CRAFFT score was 0.82. CHISPA retest reliabilities were 0.75 for alcohol use; 0.91 for having used any substances; 0.92 for number of substances used; 0.81 for frequency of substance use; and 0.79 for number of adverse events. CRAFFT scores correlated with CHISPA measures of number of substances used at 0.62; with frequency of substance use at 0.58; and with number of adverse events at 0.64.

Cronbach's alpha was satisfactory (0.77-0.80) but poor for CRAFFT (0.64). Different cut-offs are discussed. Considering validity as well as reliability, AUDIT, AUDIT-C and POSIT performed well; however, the POSIT is quite lengthy.

The CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble, 1999) was developed as a brief screening instrument for adolescents to measure AUD and SUD. This systematic review examines the psychometric properties of the CRAFFT. We performed a systematic review using Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, Pubmed/Medline, Embase (1980 to present), PsycInfo, and Google Scholar using the keywords \"CRAFFT\", \"CRAFFT questionnaire\", \"alcohol misuse\", \"alcohol abuse\", \"alcohol dependence\" \"alcohol\", \"substance misuse\", and \"substance abuse\" and \"substance dependence\". We report 11 studies on validity and six studies on reliability. Populations examined were clinic patients including hospital-based clinic patients, primary care patients, emergency room patients, Native-Americans, sexually transmitted diseases clinic patients, substance users, a general population group, and enlisting military concripts. In general, the CRAFFT was found to be a good screening instrument for gradations of alcohol and substance misuse including problem use, abuse, and dependence. At optimal cut-points, sensitivities of the CRAFFT ranged from 0.61 to 1.00, and specificities ranged from 0.33 to 0.97. The CRAFFT showed modest to adequate internal consistency values ranging from 0.65 to 0.86, and high test-retest reliability. The CRAFFT has adequate psychometric properties for detecting AUD and SUD in adolescents. However, more studies of the psychometric properties of the CRAFFT need to be carried out to further assess and improve generalizability to other populations. Gender and ethnic differences also require further examination, as do versions that are adapted for different languages and cultures.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29069318": " Barcode sequencing (bar-seq) is a high-throughput, and cost effective method to assay large numbers of cell lineages or genotypes in complex cell pools. Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing-from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq clustering are not well developed. Available methods often yield a high frequency of under-clustering artifacts that result in spurious barcodes, or over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender, an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data. In contrast with existing methods that cluster based on sequence similarity alone, Bartender uses a modified two-sample proportion test that also considers cluster size. This modification results in higher accuracy and lower rates of under- and over-clustering artifacts. Additionally, Bartender includes unique molecular identifier handling and a 'multiple time point' mode that matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods. Bartender is available at no charge for non-commercial use at https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1. sasha.levy@stonybrook.edu or song.wu@stonybrook.edu.

We aimed to monitor changes at the proteome level to identify putative protein biomarkers associated with the response of urothelial precancerous lesions to intravesical BCG treatment. The rats were divided into three groups (n = 10/group): control, non-treated, and BCG-treated groups. The non-treated and BCG-treated groups received N-methyl-N-nitrosourea intravesically. BCG Tice-strain was instilled into bladder in BCG-treated group. At the endpoint of experiment, all surviving rat bladders were collected and equally divided into two portions vertically from dome to neck. Half of each bladder was assessed immunohistopathologically and the other half was used for 2D-based comparative proteomic analysis. Differentially expressed proteins were validated by Western blot analysis. Precancerous lesions of bladder cancer were more common in non-treated group (77.8%) than in BCG-treated group (50%) and the control group (0%). Greater than twofold changes occurred in the expression of a number of proteins. Among them, Rab-GDI\u03b2, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and 14-3-3 zeta/delta were important since they were previously reported to be associated with cancer and their expression levels were found to be lower in BCG-treated group in comparison to the non-treated group. ALDH2 and 14-3-3 zeta/delta were also found to be highly expressed in the non-treated group compared to the control group. The down-regulation of these proteins and Rab-GDI\u03b2 was achieved with BCG; this result indicates that they may be used as putative biomarkers for monitoring changes in bladder carcinogenesis in response to BCG immunotherapy.",

We performed immunohistochemistry to assess the role of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and microsatellite instability (MSI) factors MutL homologue 1 (MLH1) and MutS homologue 2 (MSH2) in predicting recurrence and progression of T1 high-grade BCs having undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) alone or TURBT + intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). HER-2 overexpression was a significant predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) in the overall as well as in the two patients' population; as for progression-free survival (PFS), it was significant in the overall but not in the two patients' population. MLH1 was an independent predictor of PFS only in patients treated with BCG and MSH2 failed to predict DFS and PFS in all populations. Most importantly, the higher the number of altered markers the lowers the DFS and PFS. In multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, the number of altered molecular markers and BCG treatment were significant predictors (p = 0.0004 and 0.0283, respectively) of DFS, whereas the number of altered molecular markers was the only significant predictor (p = 0.0054) of PFS. Altered expression of the proto-oncogene HER-2 and the two molecular markers of genetic instability MLH1 and MSH2 predicted T1 high-grade BC outcome with the higher the number of altered markers the lower the DFS and PFS. These findings provide grounds for further testing them in predicting the outcome of this challenging disease.",

After the induction treatment disease-free patients underwent to at least one year of BCG maintenance therapy. Endpoints were: initial response to BCG, cancer-free survival and rate of progression at 2 years, rate of complications. No statistically significant differences were found in terms of initial response to BCG (69% in Group 1 vs 71% in Group 2, P = 0.75), cancer free survival (57% vs 55% respectively, P = 0.77) and rate of progression (20% vs 14% respectively, P = 0.26) at 2 years.

Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to treat patients with superficial bladder cancer. The proposed mechanism of action of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is adherence to the urothelium with induction of an immunologic and/or inflammatory response. The current study was designed to determine if rabbit bladder mucin removal results in increased Bacillus Calmette-Guerin urothelial adherence. PAS and colloidal iron stains were used to demonstrate that intravesical instillation of 50% acetone renders rabbit bladder urothelium mucin deficient. The urothelium remains mucin deficient at two hours, but by 24 hours the mucin layer has been regenerated. Two hours following intravesical 3H-labeled Escherichia coli administration, bacterial adherence was 29-fold greater in mucin deficient than mucin intact rabbits (p = 0.05). By 12 hours, the difference in adherence was not significant. Two hours following intravesical administration of 3H-labeled Bacillus Calmette Guerin, mucosal adherence was 21-fold greater in mucin deficient compared to mucin intact rabbits (p = 0.002). After mucin removal, Bacillus Calmette Guerin urothelial adherence was significantly increased.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 697 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations at our institution from 1991 to 2004. In 24 patients (3.5%) an underlying comorbidity directly affecting the immune system was diagnosed before bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration or steroids were administered at least 6 weeks before and at the time of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations. The immunosuppressive effect of steroids was assessed by the percent of lymphocytes. End points were the bacillus Calmette-Guerin response at 6 months, defined as normal cystoscopy, cytology and biopsy when available, and treatment related toxicity. Four patients (17%) had active lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia during bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration and 21 (88%) had a concurrent condition for which oral steroids (11), inhaled steroids (14) or oral and inhaled steroids (4) were administered. Patients treated with oral steroids had a lower percent of lymphocytes than patients treated with inhaled steroids and 15 age matched patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and no steroid treatment (12.3% vs 17.5% and 18.6%, respectively). The overall bacillus Calmette-Guerin response rate at 6 months was 58%. Ten of the 24 patients had disease recurrence and 3 had disease progression at a median followup of 63.5 months (IQR 19.5, 89). One patient treated with oral steroids had self-limited febrile disease and worsening of myalgia 48 hours after his third bacillus Calmette-Guerin cycle. No other systemic adverse event following bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy was recorded and all patients completed scheduled treatments. Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin is a viable therapeutic option in patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and concomitant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, treatment with low dose oral steroids or treatment with inhaled steroids. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin response rate at 6 months and the side effects profile associated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in these patients were comparable to those in patients with no evidence of immunosuppression. Further studies are warranted to assess the safety and efficacy of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations in critically immunocompromised patients.",

We developed a risk stratification model to provide accurate estimates of recurrence and progression probability after bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Data were analyzed on 1,062 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and included in 4 Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment trials. Stepwise multivariate Cox models were used to determine the effect of prognostic factors. In each patient the weight of all factors was summed to a total score. Patients were then divided into groups, and cumulative recurrence and progression rates were calculated. A scoring system was calculated with a score of 0 to 16 for recurrence and 0 to 14 for progression. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by score, and recurrence and progression probabilities were calculated in each group. For recurrence the variables were gender, age, grade, tumor status, multiplicity and associated Tis. For progression the variables were age, grade, tumor status, T category, multiplicity and associated Tis. For recurrence calculated risks using Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment tables were lower than those obtained with Sylvester tables. For progression probabilities were lower in our model only in patients with high risk tumors.

Of 17 patients receiving a single course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin for prophylaxis 11 remained free of tumor during short-term followup. A second course of therapy was administered to failures in each treatment category, which resulted in favorable responses in 5 of 6 patients treated for prophylaxis, 2 of 5 treated for residual tumor and 3 of 6 treated for carcinoma in situ.

Natural killer cells have a major role in the mechanism of the response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin but the exact mechanisms are still elusive. The recently discovered natural cytotoxicity receptors are linked to the host response to viral infection and to cancer. We tested the hypothesis that tumor expression of natural cytotoxicity receptor ligands can serve as a predictive factor for the response to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin in patients with nonmuscle invasive, high grade bladder cancer. We developed a histochemical staining method for analysis of the ligands of the 3 known natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46 using genetically engineered fusion proteins and an automated image analysis system. We examined formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections of specimens of transurethral bladder tumor resection from patients with primary, nonmuscle invasive, high grade bladder cancer who were subsequently treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We compared natural cytotoxicity receptor ligand expression to the response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy. Six of 17 patients (35%) had recurrence despite bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment. Primary tumors from favorably responding patients expressed higher levels of ligands for all 3 fusion proteins (NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46 p = 0.0026, 0.027 and 0.044, respectively). Bacillus Calmette-Guerin resistant, high grade, nonmuscle invasive bladder tumors express significantly lower levels of ligands of all 3 natural cytotoxicity receptors compared with bacillus Calmette-Guerin responsive tumors. This suggests that down-regulation of these ligands facilitates escape from the bacillus Calmette-Guerin effect. Furthermore, analysis of ligand expression, which can be performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections, may serve as a new predictive assay for the response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin.",

Skin test reactivity to purified protein derivative is particularly useful in predicting response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy. Currently, 60 patients have been randomized to receive bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy and only 1 of 22 patients (4.5 per cent) in whom the purified protein derivative skin test results converted from negative to positive has had recurrent tumor, compared to 12 recurrences (32 per cent) in patients whose skin tests were positive before treatment or failed to convert following treatment (p equals 0.014, chi-square).

To characterize further the local cellular response in the bladder wall of patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin bladder biopsies were examined before and immediately after a 6-week course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin and for up to 1 year at 3-month intervals thereafter. The results showed a marked infiltration after bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy predominantly of the suburothelial tissue with mononuclear cells, which expressed activation markers and accumulated to follicle-like granulomatous structures. With regard to T lymphocyte subsets the ratio of T helper-to-T suppressor cells in the bladder wall increased from 0.5 to nearly 2. This phenomenon persisted even in biopsies 1 year after initial treatment. In some probes activated mononuclear cells invaded the urothelium, emanating from suburothelial granulomas.

Effective immunotherapy may lower that risk. To test this hypothesis, mice that had survived transitional cell carcinoma (MBT2) transplantation with the aid of bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy were randomized and tested for long term protective immunity against bladder carcinoma. Fifty-one tumor-free mice that had survived tumor challenge 10 to 15 months previously were randomized into 3 groups to receive intradermal tumor .noculation and intraperitoneal levamisole, intralesional Tice strain bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or intralesional saline. Fifteen previously unchallenged animals also received tumor and intralesional saline. All 3 groups of survivors had less tumor growth (p less than 0.01) than nonsurviving controls. Even among survivors, additional bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunization, but not levamisole treatment, significantly inhibited tumor growth (p less than 0.01). A 2nd experiment compared 22 nonimmune mice, 21 mice preimmunized intravenously with 300 micrograms of bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell walls, and 18 mice that had survived MBT2 by 8 months after live bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment. Nonimmune and survivor groups were randomly subdivided into saline or treatment groups. Cell wall-preimmunized mice were divided into matching groups according to footpad response to purified protein derivative. The cell-wall preimmunized and nonimmune mice received the immunostimulant P3+Re-glycolipid or the carrier solution alone. The group of survivors received either intralesional saline or live bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Both bacillus Calmette-Guerin and saline-treated groups had significantly less tumor growth (p less than 0.001) than nonsurviving controls. Animals treated with P3-Re-glycolipid (with or without preimmunization with cell wall) did not differ from nonsurviving control. Footpad response to purified protein derivative did not correlate with tumor growth in these mice. Our results suggest that intralesional bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy can afford long term protection from transplanted bladder cancer, and that live bacillus Calmette-Guerin is superior to levamisole and P3 + Re-glycolipid + bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell walls in the treatment of bladder cancer.",

A total of 113 patient samples were included: 45 from posttransplant patients, 44 from children and 24 random routine samples. The degree of automation was scored through the need of manual revisions triggered by AQUIOS CL run notifications and run flags. Intrarun and interrun variability was &lt;9.1% with dedicated control material and &lt;32.1% with patient samples. Relative values of lymphocyte subsets could be determined up to 48 h after venipuncture when the sample was kept at room temperature. There was no carryover and good linearity. Interpanel consistency was 3.3% for relative values and 9.4% for absolute values. Method comparison showed good analytical correlation between AQUIOS CL and a dual-platform method. Thirty-five percent of the samples triggered a run notification. In 74% of these samples, the results could be accepted without intervention, so in 26% of all samples, an unnecessary notification was generated. AQUIOS CL allows for reliable fully automated immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subset quantitation. Gating algorithms could be further improved.",

Our aim is to investigate the changes of circulating T-cell subsets after microwave ablation (MWA) and to explore the risk factors of tumor recurrence in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Thirty patients with HBV-related HCC were enrolled in this study. The blood samples were collected both before and after MWA (24 h, 72 h, and 1 month after MWA). The distributions of Th17 cells, regulatory Treg-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and CD3+ T-cells were determined by flow cytometer. The potential-related factors of tumor recurrence were analyzed by logistic regression. The levels of circulating T-cell subsets, except for Th17 cells, were relatively stable after MWA. The frequency of Th17 cells increased from 3.98% \u00b1 2.40% before treatment to 5.53% \u00b13.27% 24 h after treatment. Eight of 30 patients had a tumor recurrence. The results of logistic regression suggested that among 11 candidates, only the level of Th17 cells was the risk factor of tumor recurrence. To remove the interference from other factors, seven patients with tumor(s) &gt;3 cm or alpha-fetoprotein &gt;400 ng/mL were excluded in another parallel logistic regression. The results of such regression clearly demonstrated that circulating Th17 cells is indeed a related factor of tumor recurrence. Thermal ablation may evoke a transitional immune response by increasing the frequency of Th17 cells. Patients with high levels of baseline circulating Th17 cells, instead of the transient elevation of Th17 cells induced by MWA, are at the risk of tumor recurrence.",

This working session presented a critical review of the current RM landscape in Europe and North America with possible projections for the future. Interestingly, the RM development cycle seems to obey the Gartner hype cycle, now at the enlightenment phase, after past exaggerated expectations and discouragements, as suggested by increasing numbers of clinical trials and recent market approvals of RM solutions in both Europe (Glybera and Holoclar<sup>\u00ae</sup> from Chiesi Pharma and Strimvelis<sup>\u00ae</sup> from GSK) and Japan (Remestemcel-L from Mesoblast<sup>\u00ae</sup>). The successful commercial translation of RM research is governed by five major drivers: (i) fully validated manufacturing capability for autologous or allogeneic products, (ii) reimbursement for targeted clinical indications with high and demonstrable medico-economic benefits versus standard of care, (iii) implication of regulatory bodies in the design and development plan of any RM solution, which should be well characterized, robust, with proven consistent efficacy and an acceptable and controlled positive benefit/risk ratio, (iv) collaborations facilitated by multicompetence hubs/consortia of excellence, (v) well-thought-out clinical development plans for reducing the risk of failure. Benefiting from past and present experience, the RM burgeoning industry is expected to accelerate the market release of cost-effective RM products with real curative potential for specific clinical indications with high unmet needs.

Therefore, inhibiting Bcl-2 function may enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells. Tetrocarcin A (TC-A) and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides exhibit antitumor activity by inhibiting Bcl-2 function and transcription, respectively. We investigated whether these antitumor agents would enhance the cytotoxic effects of radiation in tumor cells overexpressing Bcl-2. We used HeLa/bcl-2 cells, a stable Bcl-2-expressing cell line derived from wild-type HeLa (HeLa/wt) cells. Cells were incubated with TC-A and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides for 24 h after irradiation, and cell viability was then determined. Apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometric assay. The HeLa/bcl-2 cells were more resistant to radiation than HeLa/wt cells. At concentrations that are not inherently cytotoxic, both TC-A and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides increased the cytotoxic effects of radiation in HeLa/bcl-2 cells, but not in HeLa/wt cells. However, in HeLa/bcl-2 cells, additional treatment with TC-A in combination with radiation did not significantly increase apoptosis. The present results suggest that TC-A and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides reduce radioresistance of tumor cells overexpressing Bcl-2. Therefore, a combination of radiotherapy and Bcl-2 inhibitors may prove to be a useful therapeutic approach for treating tumors that overexpress Bcl-2.",

Here we find that an anti-tumor antibiotic, tetrocarcin A, directly induces apoptosis of human breast cancer cells. The apoptosis is accompanied by the activation of a proteolytic cascade of caspases including caspase-3 and -9, and concomitantly decreases phosphorylation of Akt, PDK1, and PTEN, a tumor suppressor that regulates the activity of Akt through the dephosphorylation of polyphosphoinositides. Tetrocarcin A affected neither expression of Akt, PDK1, or PTEN, nor did it affect the expression of Bcl family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Bax.

In this study, we analyzed the direct proapoptotic effect of TC-A in the B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) model. We focused on the signal cascade triggered by TC-A in B-CLL cells and identified activated mitochondrial as well as endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress signals. The expression levels of known effector molecules mediating mitochondrial signaling, such as Bax and Bid, and the antagonistic molecule Bcl-2 did not influence sensitivity of B-CLL cells to TC-A. Furthermore, the molecular chaperone and sensor of ER stress, HSP70, though significantly up-regulated in B-CLL cells undergoing TC-A-triggered apoptosis, was ineffective to exert its anti-apoptotic function described in multiple cell death pathways. Autologous T cells of B-CLL patients were significantly less sensitive to TC-A as were also T cells from healthy donors when compared with their normal B-cell fraction. Furthermore, sensitivity of B-CLL cells to TC-A treatment in vitro was dependent neither on the expression levels of CD38-a prognostic factor for survival of B-CLL patients as well as for their response to therapy-nor on the clinical stage or pretreatment status of patients. From our data showing that TC-A induced a cell death pathway via ER stress preferentially in B cells and that it acted independently of important markers of drug sensitivity and of clinical markers, we conclude that TC-A might represent an attractive candidate drug for further evaluation in preclinical trials.",

Screening of a natural compound library identified the antibiotic Tetrocarcin-A as a novel downregulator of JAM-A and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) protein expression in breast cancer cells. Lysosomal inhibition partially rescued the downregulation of JAM-A and HER2 caused by Tetrocarcin-A, and attenuated its cytotoxic activity. Tetrocarcin-A treatment or JAM-A silencing reduced AKT and ERK phosphorylation, inhibited c-FOS phosphorylation at Threonine-232 (its transcriptional regulation site), inhibited nuclear localization of c-FOS, and downregulated expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP). This was accompanied by Tetrocarcin-A-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. To begin evaluating the potential clinical relevance of our findings, we extended our studies to other models. Encouragingly, Tetrocarcin-A downregulated JAM-A expression and caused cytotoxicity in primary breast cells and lung cancer stem cells, and inhibited the growth of xenografts in a semi-in vivo model involving invasion across the chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane.

In the past few years, neuroscientific research has shown the importance of the microbiota in the development of brain systems. Recent studies showed that the microbiota could activate the immune and central nervous systems, including commensal and pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. Gut microorganisms are capable of producing and delivering neuroactive substances such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid, which act on the gut-brain axis.

In addition to inhibiting monoamine oxidase type B, it blocks sodium channels and modulates glutamate (Glu) release in vitro. Since this property might contribute to the therapeutic action of the drug, we undertook the present study to investigate whether safinamide inhibits Glu release also in vivo and whether this effect is consistent across different brain areas and is selective for glutamatergic neurons. To this aim, in vivo microdialysis was used to monitor the spontaneous and veratridine-induced Glu and GABA release in the hippocampus and basal ganglia of naive, awake rats. Brain levels of safinamide were measured as well. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the effect of safinamide, sodium currents were measured by patch-clamp recording in rat cortical neurons. Safinamide maximally inhibited the veratridine-induced Glu and GABA release in hippocampus at 15 mg/kg, which reached free brain concentrations of 1.89-1.37 <i>\u00b5</i>M. This dose attenuated veratridine-stimulated Glu (but not GABA) release in subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra reticulata, but not in striatum. Safinamide was ineffective on spontaneous neurotransmitter release. In vitro, safinamide inhibited sodium channels, showing a greater affinity at depolarized (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8 <i>\u00b5</i>M) than at resting (IC<sub>50</sub> = 262 <i>\u00b5</i>M) potentials. We conclude that safinamide inhibits in vivo Glu release from stimulated nerve terminals, likely via blockade of sodium channels at subpopulations of neurons with specific firing patterns. These data are consistent with the anticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian actions of safinamide and provide support for the nondopaminergic mechanism of its action.",

This post-hoc analysis evaluated the reduction of concomitant pain treatments and the changes in the scores of the items related to pain of the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39). A path analysis was performed in order to examine direct and indirect associations between safinamide and PDQ-39 pain-related items assessed after 6-months of treatment. The percentage of patients with no pain treatments at the end of the trials was significantly lower in the safinamide group compared to the placebo group. Safinamide 100 mg/day significantly reduced on average the individual use of pain treatments by \u224824% and significantly improved two out of three PDQ-39 pain-related items of the \"Bodily discomfort\" domain.Path analysis showed that the direct effect of safinamide on pain accounted for about 80% of the total effect. These results suggest that safinamide may have a positive effect on pain, one of the most underestimated non-motor symptoms. Prospective studies are warranted to investigate this potential benefit.",

It works through multiple mechanisms, namely as a reversible selective monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor and through modulation of glutamate release. Safinamide is extensively metabolized via oxidation to several inactive metabolites that are excreted primarily through the urine. Several large Phase III clinical trials of patients with advanced PD with motor fluctuations have shown that safinamide, administered orally at doses of 50-100 mg daily, increased ON time with no or non-troublesome dyskinesia, decreased daily OFF time, improved overall motor function (as measured by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] part III total score), and quality of life (as measured by Clinical Global Impression-Change and 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire). In large clinical trials of patients with early PD on a single dopamine agonist, safinamide administered orally at a dose of 100 mg daily improved overall motor function as measured by UPDRS part III total score; however, some of the results reported were exploratory. Safinamide is generally well-tolerated and safe, with few to no treatment-related adverse events. Safinamide does not cause new or worsening dyskinesia and may be able to reduce this symptom in patients reporting it at baseline. Evidence suggests that safinamide is a good option for add-on therapy to carbidopa/levodopa in patients with advanced PD with motor complications, but there is still insufficient evidence to recommend it as monotherapy or add-on therapy in patients with early PD.",

In addition to its selective and reversible monoamine oxidase B inhibition, safinamide through use-dependent sodium channel blockade reduces overactive glutamatergic transmission in basal ganglia, which is believed to contribute to motor symptoms and complications including levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The present study investigated the effects of safinamide on the development of LID in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats, evaluating behavioral, molecular, and neurochemical parameters associated with LID appearance. 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were treated with saline, levodopa (6 mg/kg), or levodopa plus safinamide (15 mg/kg) for 21 days. Abnormal involuntary movements, motor performance, molecular composition of the striatal glutamatergic synapse, glutamate, and GABA release were analyzed. In the striatum, safinamide prevented the rearrangement of the subunit composition of <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and the levodopa-induced increase of glutamate release associated with dyskinesia without affecting the levodopa-stimulated motor performance and dyskinesia. Overall, these findings suggest that the striatal glutamate-modulating component of safinamide's activity may contribute to its clinical effects, where its long-term use as levodopa add-on therapy significantly improves motor function and \"on\" time without troublesome dyskinesia.",

Approximately 74-88% of patients with gMG have acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies. Complement plays an important role in innate and antibody-mediated immunity, and activation and amplification of complement results in the formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs), lipophilic proteins that damage cell membranes. The role of complement in gMG has been demonstrated in animal models and patients. Studies in animals lacking specific complement proteins have confirmed that MAC formation is required to induce experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) and NMJ damage. Complement inhibition in EAMG models can prevent disease induction and reverse its progression. Patients with anti-AChR<sup>+</sup> MG have autoantibodies and MACs present at NMJs. Damaged NMJs are associated with more severe disease, fewer AChRs, and MACs in synaptic debris. Current MG therapies do not target complement directly. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits cleavage of complement protein C5, preventing MAC formation. Eculizumab treatment improved symptoms compared with placebo in a phase II study in patients with refractory gMG.

The patient cells displayed down-regulation of key pathways relevant to learning and memory, including Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP)-signaling pathway genes. We found that PHF21A is required for full induction of a luciferase reporter carrying cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) following stimulation by the cAMP analog, forskolin. Finally, PHF21A-deficient patient-derived cells exhibited a delayed induction of immediate early genes following forskolin stimulation. These results suggest that an impaired response to cAMP signaling might be involved in the pathology of PHF21A deficiency.

Current literature implicates haploinsufficiency of three genes (ALX4, EXT2, and PHF21A) in causing some of the cardinal features of PSS. We report a patient with multiple exostoses, biparietal foramina, and history of mild developmental delay. Cognitive and behavioral testing supported formal diagnoses of anxiety, verbal dyspraxia, articulation disorder, and coordination disorder, without intellectual disability. His facial features, though distinctive, were not typical of those observed in PSS. As the chromosomal deletion does not encompass PHF21A, this case lends further support that haploinsufficiency of PHF21A contributes to the intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities in PSS and that there are other genes in the region which likely contribute to the behavioral phenotype in this syndrome. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Classic features include biparietal foramina, multiple exostoses, profound hypotonia, dysmorphic features, and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Fewer than 40 individuals with PSS have been reported, with variable clinical presentations due in part to disparity in deletion sizes. We report on a boy who presented for initial evaluation at age 13 months because of a history of developmental delay, hypotonia, subtle dysmorphic features, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. SNP microarray analysis identified a 137 kb deletion at 11p11.2, which maps within the classically defined PSS interval. This deletion results in haploinsufficiency for all or portions of six OMIM genes: SLC35C1, CRY2, MAPK8IP1, PEX16, GYLTL1B, and PHF21A. Recently, translocations interrupting PHF21A have been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies similar to those seen in PSS. The identification of this small deletion in a child with developmental delay and hypotonia provides further evidence for the genetic basis of developmental disability and identifies a critical region sufficient to cause hypotonia in this syndrome. Additionally, this case illustrates the utility of high resolution genomic approaches in correlating clinical phenotypes with specific genes in contiguous gene deletion syndromes.",

Cytogenetic analysis showed a deletion on 11p that was further characterized using FISH and MLPA analyses. The deletion (11p13-p12) located in the area between the deletions associated with the WAGR and Potocki-Shaffer syndromes had a maximum size of 8.5 Mb and encompasses 44 genes. Deletion of WT1 explains the genital abnormalities observed. As PAX6 was intact the cataract observed cannot be explained by a deletion of this gene. Seizures have been described in Potocki-Shaffer syndrome while mental retardation has been described in both WAGR and Potocki-Shaffer syndrome.

Diff) induced disease, including when such tests should be done in children and how they should be interpreted. Multiple tests are available for detecting disease due to C. diff. These include colonoscopy and stool analysis. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the most sensitive test for detecting the presence of colitis. The toxins produced by the C. diff. (toxin A, toxin B, and binary toxin) are the agents that cause injury and disease. Only toxin producing C. diff. Strains will cause disease. Binary toxin by itself is not thought to produce disease. Binary toxin causes disease in humans when present with toxin A and B producing bacteria, and has been implicated with fulminant life threatening disease. Stool analyses vary in sensitivity and specificity depending on the assay used. The presence of toxin producing strains of C diff. in the stool does not equate with disease. The presence of a toxin-producing bacteria or toxins (A or B) only equates with disease if diarrhea or a diseased colon (toxic megacolon, ileus, and sepsis) is present. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), when used in the stool from patients with diarrhea, appears to be the most efficient study to detect the gene that encodes for toxin A and B and thus to diagnose C. diff.-induced disease. Infants have a high carriage rate of C. diff. and are believed not to develop disease from it or its toxins. Infants should not be tested for C. difficile. The NAAT is most specific when done on patients with diarrhea with liquid stools. Testing for C. difficile should only be done on patients with diarrhea. One can assume that a patient who has no diarrhea and is not ill does not have C. diff.-induced disease. Treatment should be limited to patients with diarrhea who test positive for C. diff. toxin (A or B) or toxin-producing bacteria. Direct testing for binary toxin is not commercially available. Binary toxin is only thought to cause disease in humans when C. diff. toxin (A and B)-producing bacteria are present.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28366569": "Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive intestine bacterium that causes a severe diarrhea and could eventually be lethal. The main virulence factor is related to the release of two major exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB). Recent C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) outbreaks have been caused by hypervirulent strains which secrete an additional binary toxin (CDTa/CDTb). Vaccination against these toxins is considered the best way to combat the CDAD. Recently, a novel tetravalent C. difficile vaccine candidate containing all four toxins produced from a baculovirus expression system has been developed. A dose assay to release this tetravalent C. difficile vaccine was developed using tandem ion-exchange HPLC chromatography. A sequential weak cation exchange (carboxyl group) and weak anion exchange (tertiary amine group) columns were employed. The four C. difficile vaccine antigen pIs range from 4.4 to 8.6. The final optimized separation employs salt gradient elution at two different pHs. The standard analytical parameters such as LOD, LOQ, linearity, accuracy, precision and repeatability were evaluated for this method and it was deemed acceptable as a quantitative assay for vaccine release. Furthermore, the developed method was utilized for monitoring the stability of the tetravalent C. difficile vaccine in final container.",

The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain, preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI.",

All three caused fluid accumulation in the small intestine, maximal secretion being induced by 1 micrograms of toxin A, 20 micrograms of B, and 15 micrograms of C. Both toxins A and C caused shedding of epithelial cells from the villi without visible damage to crypt cells; toxin A caused further extensive necrosis and bleeding. Toxin B caused secretion without visible damage to the epithelial cells, though this activity was unstable and decreased significantly after one week of storage. In the colon, toxin A caused secretion and shedding of surface epithelial cells without damage to crypt cells, toxin C caused only a weak secretion, and toxin B had no effect at all. In terms of immunohistochemistry, it was found that toxin A bound to the enterocytes at the tips of the villi but not to goblet and crypt cells.

Multiple studies have also demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects in vascular and skin cells. Here, we used vaspin treated 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes as well as 3T3-L1 cells with stable vaspin expression to investigate the effect of exogenous and endogenous vaspin on inflammatory processes and insulin signaling in adipocytes. Our stably transfected cells secreted significant amounts of vaspin which was in the physiological range of \u223c0.5 ng/ml in cell supernatants. Adipocyte differentiation was not affected by vaspin as expression of adipogenic marker genes as well as lipid accumulation after full differentiation was similar to control cells. We found that IL-1\u03b2 induced expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, MCP1 and TNF\u03b1 was significantly blunted in vaspin expressing 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with exogenous vaspin resulted in reduced cytokine-induced activation of the intracellular and pro-inflammatory NF\u03baB signaling cascades (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, I\u03baB and NF\u03baB). Moreover, endogenous vaspin positively affected insulin signaling by increasing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the key mediator protein kinase B (AKT). Together, we demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of vaspin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as increased insulin signaling by endogenous expression or exogenous treatment. The results provide evidence for potent anti-inflammatory action of vaspin not only in vascular cells but also in adipose tissue.",

This study was designed to investigate the impact of vaspin on autophagy in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-induced injury in cardiomyocytes and its cardioprotective effects in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). H9C2 cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1 with or without vaspin in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 treatment inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptosis in H9C2 cells after stimulating for 24 hours. Pretreatment with vaspin significantly mitigated apoptosis induced by TNF-\u03b1 partly because of augment effects of vaspin on autophagy as demonstrated by a higher ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, higher expression of Beclin-1, and increased autophagosomes formation. Furthermore, the AKT agonist IGF-1 significantly reversed the effect of vaspin on autophagy. In vivo DCM model was also developed by treating rats with streptozotocin followed by intraperitoneal injection with vaspin. In DCM rats, upregulation of vaspin reversed cardiac dysfunction, as identified by increased left ventricular ejection fractions and fractional shortening levels, a higher Em/Am ratio, and lower levels of TNF-\u03b1, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase-myocardial isoenzyme. In conclusion, vaspin attenuated the TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis by promoting autophagy probably through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and further ameliorated the cardiac dysfunction in DCM rats.",

Adults previously exposed to these neonatal stressors show a sex difference in the insulin and glucose response to arginine stimulation suggesting a state of insulin resistance. The current study used this cohort of adult rats to evaluate insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], plasma adipokines (reflecting insulin resistance states), and testosterone. The major findings were that daily maternal-neonatal separation led to an increase in body weight and HOMA-IR in adult male and female rats and increased plasma leptin in adult male rats only; neither prior neonatal hypoxia (without or with body temperature control) nor neonatal hypothermia altered subsequent adult HOMA-IR or plasma adiponectin. Adult male-female differences in plasma leptin were lost with prior exposure to neonatal hypoxia or hypothermia; male-female differences in resistin were lost in the adults that were exposed to hypoxia and spontaneous hypothermia as neonates. Exposure of neonates to daily hypoxia without spontaneous hypothermia led to a decrease in plasma testosterone in adult male rats. We conclude that neonatal stressors result in subsequent adult sex-dependent increases in insulin resistance and adipokines and that our rat model of prematurity with hypoxia without hypothermia alters adult testosterone dynamics.",

A role for monoaminergic systems in treating these conditions is highlighted by the clinical use of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that act on these systems, such as dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, and armodafinil. Solriamfetol (JZP-110) is a wake-promoting agent that is currently being evaluated to treat ES in patients with narcolepsy or OSA. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol differ from medications such as modafinil and amphetamine. The goal of the current studies was to characterize the mechanism of action of solriamfetol at monoamine transporters using in vitro and in vivo assays. Results indicate that solriamfetol has dual reuptake inhibition activity at dopamine (DA; IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.9 <i>\u03bc</i>M) and norepinephrine (NE; IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.4 <i>\u03bc</i>M) transporters, and this activity is associated in vivo with increased extracellular concentration of DA and NE as measured by microdialysis. Solriamfetol has negligible functional activity at the serotonin transporter (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 <i>\u03bc</i>M). Moreover, the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol are probably owing to activity at DA and NE transporters rather than other neurotransmitter systems, such as histamine or orexin. The dual activity of solriamfetol at DA and NE transporters and the lack of significant monoamine-releasing properties of solriamfetol might explain the differences in the in vivo effects of solriamfetol compared with modafinil or amphetamine.

Overall Next Day Drug Liking was greater than placebo for solriamfetol 300 mg and phentermine 45 and 90 mg ( p &lt; 0.05). Willingness to Take the Drug Again was significantly greater than placebo and significantly less than both doses of phentermine for all doses of solriamfetol ( p &lt; 0.05). Ratings of negative subjective effects (bad effects, disliking, anxiety, agitation) were higher with solriamfetol 600 and 1200 mg relative to phentermine. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with solriamfetol were hypervigilance, elevated mood, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, and insomnia. Solriamfetol appears to have abuse potential similar to or lower than phentermine.",

Current pharmacotherapy is ineffective in correcting sleep-disordered breathing and is used adjunctively to address residual sleepiness. A new drug, solriamfetol, a selective norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is the first drug of its class that is being considered by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat excessive sleepiness in OSA and narcolepsy patients. <b>Areas covered</b>: This review covers drug chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of solriamfetol. Results of three Phase 3 trials, Treatment of OSA and Narcolepsy Excessive Sleepiness (TONES 3, 4, 5), relevant to OSA patients are summarized. Published abstracts/articles and a 2017 Jazz Investor Presentation provided data. Databases searched included PubMed, Google Scholar, Lexi-Comp, Scopus, Science, and Ovid. <b>Expert commentary</b>: Solriamfetol shows promise as adjunctive therapy in OSA. It is well tolerated and effective in reducing sleepiness and is an alternative to modafinil or armodafinil.

Furthermore, effectiveness of sleep apnea treatment is limited by poor adherence. Currently available pharmacologic options for the treatment of sleepiness in this population are limited. <b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol (JZP-110), a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with robust wake-promoting effects, for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea with current or prior sleep apnea treatment. <b>Methods:</b> This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week trial comparing solriamfetol, 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg, with placebo. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Of 476 randomized participants, 459 were included in the prespecified efficacy analyses. Coprimary endpoints (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test sleep latency and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score) were met at all solriamfetol doses (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), with dose-dependent effects observed at Week 1 maintained over the study duration. All doses except 37.5 mg resulted in higher percentages of participants reporting improvement on Patient Global Impression of Change (key secondary endpoint; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Adverse events were reported in 47.9% of placebo- and 67.9% of solriamfetol-treated participants; five participants experienced serious adverse events (two [1.7%] placebo, three [0.8%] solriamfetol); none were deemed related to study drug. The most common adverse events with solriamfetol were headache (10.1%), nausea (7.9%), decreased appetite (7.6%), anxiety (7.0%), and nasopharyngitis (5.1%). <b>Conclusions:</b> Solriamfetol significantly increased wakefulness and reduced sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive sleepiness; most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.

Cas9 and Cas12 (previously called Cpf1) are widely used as DNA nucleases for inducing site-specific DNA breaks for different kinds of genome engineering applications, and in their mutated forms as DNA-binding proteins to modify gene expression. Moreover, histone modifications, as well as cytosine methylation or base editing, were achieved with these systems in plants. Recently, with the discovery of the nuclease Cas13a (previously called C2c2), molecular biologists have obtained a system that enables sequence-specific cleavage of single-stranded RNA molecules. The latest experiments with this and also the alternative Cas13b system demonstrate that these proteins can be used in a similar manner in eukaryotes for RNA manipulation as Cas9 and Cas12 for DNA manipulations. The first application of Cas13a for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in plants has been reported. Recent results show that the system is also applicable for combating viral infection in plants. As single-stranded RNA viruses are by far the most abundant class of viruses in plants, the application of this system is of special promise for crops. More interesting applications are imminent for plant biologists, with nuclease dead versions of Cas13 enabling the ability to visualize RNA molecules in vivo, as well as to edit different kinds of RNA molecules at specific bases by deamination or to modify them by conjugation. Moreover, by combining DNA- and RNA-directed systems, the most complex of changes in plant metabolism might be achievable.",

Whereas, the overall antioxidant capacity of brown algae extracts has been widely studied, the antioxidant capacity of individual phlorotannins has been rarely explored. The aim of this study was to determine the structure dependant antioxidant capacity of phlorotannins from Icelandic brown algae, Fucus vesiculosus. The antioxidant capacity of individual phlorotannins was determined by an on-line method using liquid chromatography and an electrochemical detector followed by quadrupole Time of Flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-ECD-QTOFMS). Tentative structural elucidation of 13 phlorotannin isomers from EAF was obtained by LC-DAD-QTOFMS, ranging from 374 to 870Da. On-line determination of antioxidant capacity of the individual phlorotannins generally showed that low molecular phlorotannins exhibited higher antioxidant capacity and that the capacity decreased with polymerisation.",

Phytochemical determinations showed considerable differences in total phenolic content (TPC) and phlorotannin content (PHT). The highest TPC level (26.45 mg PGE/g dry material (Dm)) and PHT level (873.14 \u03bcg PGE/g Dm) were observed in C. sedoides. The antioxidant properties of these three fractions assessed by three different methods indicated that C. sedoides displayed the highest total antioxidant activity among the three species (71.30 mg GAE/g Dm), as well as the free radical scavenging activity with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> value in both DPPH (27.7 \u03bcg/mL) and ABTS (19.1 \u03bcg/mL) assays. Furthermore, the pharmacological screening of the anti-inflammatory potential of these fractions using in vivo models, in comparison to reference drugs, established a remarkable activity of PHT-SED at the dose of 100 mg/kg; the inhibition percentages of ear edema in mice model and paw edema in rats model were of 82.55 and 81.08%, respectively. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissues has been quantified, and PHT-SED was found to remarkably increase the lipid peroxidation in rat liver tissues. In addition, in two pain mice models, PHT-SED displayed a profound antinociceptive activity at 100 mg/kg and has proved a better analgesic activity when used in combination with the opioid drug, tramadol.",

Soluble \u03b2-amyloid oligomer, which can induce neurotoxicity, is generally regarded as the main neurotoxin in Alzheimer's disease. Here we report that eckmaxol, a phlorotannin extracted from the brown alga Ecklonia maxima, could produce neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cells. Eckmaxol effectively prevented but did not rescue \u03b2-amyloid oligomer-induced neuronal apoptosis and increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Eckmaxol also significantly reversed the decreased expression of phospho-Ser9-glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 and increased expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which was induced by A\u03b2 oligomer. Moreover, both glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 and mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitors produced neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, eckmaxol showed favorable interaction in the ATP binding site of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 and mitogen activated protein kinase. These results suggested that eckmaxol might produce neuroprotective effects via concurrent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, possibly via directly acting on glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 and mitogen activated protein kinase. Based on the central role that \u03b2-amyloid oligomers play in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and the high annual production of Ecklonia maxima for alginate and other nutritional ingredients, this report represents a new candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and also expands the potential application of Ecklonia maxima and its constituents in the field of pharmacology.",

Among the crude extract and different polarity fractions, the phlorotannin-enriched ethyl acetate fraction possessed the highest DPPH scavenging activity and reducing power. This fraction was further fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography or ultrafiltration. The antioxidant properties were evaluated by both the above chemical antioxidant tests and a mononuclear cell-based bioassay. Sephadex subfractions LH-2 and LH-3 with high total phlorotannin content exhibited strong DPPH quenching activity, comparable to those of ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene and significantly higher than that of \u03b1-tocopherol. Polyphenols in F. vesiculosus were found to consist mainly of high molecular weight phlorotannin polymers. There were no clear relationships between the degree of polymerization, molecular size, and antioxidant activity. All the subfractions separated by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and ultrafiltration showed a high ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species generated by mononuclear cells.

While many investigations revolve around Panx1 functions in health and disease, more recently, details started emerging about mechanisms that control Panx1 channel activity. These advancements in Panx1 biology have revealed that beyond its classical role as an unopposed plasma membrane channel, it participates in alternative pathways involving multiple intracellular compartments, protein complexes and a myriad of extracellular participants. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of Panx1 at the center of these pathways, highlighting its modulation in a context specific manner.

Panx1 and Panx2 intermixing can regulate channel properties, and both pannexins have been implicated in neuronal cell death after ischemia. Our objectives were to validate the predicted N-glycosylation site of Panx2 and to study the effects of Panx2 glycosylation on localization and its capacity to interact with Panx1. We used site-directed mutagenesis, enzymatic de-glycosylation, cell-surface biotinylation, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy. Our results showed that N86 is the only N-glycosylation site of Panx2. Panx2 and the N86Q mutant are predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis-Golgi matrix with limited cell surface localization was seen only in the presence of Panx1. The Panx2 N86Q mutant is glycosylation-deficient and tends to aggregate in the ER reducing its cell surface trafficking but it can still interact with Panx1. Our study indicates that N-glycosylation may be important for folding and trafficking of Panx2. We found that the un-glycosylated forms of Panx1 and 2 can readily interact, regulating their localization and potentially their channel function in cells where they are co-expressed.",

Panx1 channels are generally of major importance in a large number of system and cellular processes and their function has been thoroughly characterized. In contrast, little is known about channel structure and subcellular distribution. We therefore determine the subcellular localization of Panx1 channels in cultured cells and aim at the identification of channel morphology in vitro. Using freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling on EYFP-Panx1-overexpressing HEK 293 cells, large particles were identified in plasma membranes, which were immunogold-labeled using either GFP or Panx1 antibodies. There was no labeling or particles in the nuclear membranes of these cells, pointing to plasma membrane localization of Panx1-EYFP channels. The assembly of particles was irregular, this being in contrast to the regular pattern of gap junctions. The fact that no counterparts were identified on apposing cells, which would have been indicative of intercellular signaling, supported the idea of Panx1 channels within one membrane. Control cells (transfected with EYFP only, non-transfected) were devoid of both particles and immunogold labeling. Altogether, this study provides the first demonstration of Panx1 channel morphology and assembly in intact cells. The identification of Panx1 channels as large particles within the plasma membrane provides the knowledge required to enable recognition of Panx1 channels in tissues in future studies.

Three distinct Panx paralogs (Panx1, Panx2 and Panx3) have been identified in vertebrates but previous reports on Panx expression and functionality focused primarily on Panx1 and Panx3 proteins. Several gene expression studies reported that Panx2 transcript is largely restricted to the central nervous system (CNS) hence suggesting that Panx2 might serve an important role in the CNS. However, the lack of suitable antibodies prevented the creation of a comprehensive map of Panx2 protein expression and Panx2 protein localization profile is currently mostly inferred from the distribution of its transcript. In this study, we characterized novel commercial monoclonal antibodies and surveyed Panx2 expression and distribution at the mRNA and protein level by real-time qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Panx2 protein levels were readily detected in every tissue examined, even when transcriptional analysis predicted very low Panx2 protein expression. Furthermore, our results indicate that Panx2 transcriptional activity is a poor predictor of Panx2 protein abundance and does not correlate with Panx2 protein levels. Despite showing disproportionately high transcript levels, the CNS expressed less Panx2 protein than any other tissues analyzed. Additionally, we showed that Panx2 protein does not localize at the plasma membrane like other gap junction proteins but remains confined within cytoplasmic compartments. Overall, our results demonstrate that the endogenous expression of Panx2 protein is not restricted to the CNS and is more ubiquitous than initially predicted.",

We recently demonstrated that cariprazine also has significant antianhedonic-like effects in rats subjected to chronic stress; however, the exact mechanism of action for cariprazine's antidepressant-like properties is not known. Thus, in this study we examined whether the effects of cariprazine are mediated by dopamine D3 receptors. Wild-type and D3-knockout mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress for up to 26 days, treated daily with vehicle, imipramine (20 mg/kg), aripiprazole (1 and 5 mg/kg), or cariprazine (0.03, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg), and tested in behavioral assays measuring anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors. Results showed that cariprazine significantly attenuated chronic unpredictable stress-induced anhedonic-like behavior in wild-type mice, demonstrating potent antidepressant-like effects comparable with aripiprazole and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. This antianhedonic-like effect of cariprazine was not observed in D3-knockout mice, suggesting that the cariprazine antidepressant-like activity is mediated by dopamine D3 receptors. Moreover, cariprazine significantly reduced drinking latency in the novelty-induced hypophagia test in wild-type mice, further confirming its antianhedonic-like effect and showing that it also has anxiolytic-like activity. In combination with previous studies, these results suggest that cariprazine has a unique pharmacological profile and distinct dopamine D3 receptor-dependent mechanism of action that may be beneficial in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder.",

As a consequence of its improved adverse effects, cariprazine improves patients' quality of life to a greater extent than other second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Cariprazine is a promising antipsychotic drug in the treatment of schizophrenia, acute mania in bipolar disorder, and in schizophrenia with mania. In these patients, its long-term therapeutic effect and its action in comparison with other second-generation antipsychotic drugs, above all aripiprazole, remain to be tested in clinical trials.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26723167": "Current antipsychotic medication is largely ineffective against the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. One promising therapeutic development is to design new molecules that balance actions on dopamine D2 and D3 receptors to maximise benefits and limit adverse effects. This study used two rodent paradigms to investigate the action of the dopamine D3-preferring D3/D2 receptor partial agonist cariprazine. In adult male rats, cariprazine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.p.), and the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole (1-3 mg/kg i.p.) caused dose-dependent reversal of a delay-induced impairment in novel object recognition (NOR). Treating neonatal rat pups with phencyclidine (PCP) and subsequent social isolation produced a syndrome of behavioural alterations in adulthood including hyperactivity in a novel arena, deficits in NOR and fear motivated learning and memory, and a reduction and change in pattern of social interaction accompanied by increased ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). Acute administration of cariprazine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and aripiprazole (3 mg/kg) to resultant adult rats reduced neonatal PCP-social isolation induced locomotor hyperactivity and reversed NOR deficits. Cariprazine (0.3 mg/kg) caused a limited reversal of the social interaction deficit but neither drug affected the change in USVs or the deficit in fear motivated learning and memory. Results suggest that in the behavioural tests investigated cariprazine is at least as effective as aripiprazole and in some paradigms it showed additional beneficial features further supporting the advantage of combined dopamine D3/D2 receptor targeting. These findings support recent clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of cariprazine in treatment of negative symptoms and functional impairment in schizophrenia patients.",

Cariprazine also displays partial agonism at serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and antagonism at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors in vitro. The study objective was to determine whether cariprazine leads to functional alterations of monoamine systems in vivo via electrophysiological recordings from anesthetized rats. Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), locus coeruleus (LC), and hippocampus pyramidal neurons were recorded, and cariprazine was administered systemically or locally through iontophoresis. In the DRN, cariprazine completely inhibited the firing activity of 5-HT neurons, which was fully reversed by the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist, WAY100635. In the LC, cariprazine reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, on norepinephrine (NE) neurons (ED<sub>50</sub> = 66 <i>\u00b5</i>g/kg) but did not block the inhibitory effect of the <i>\u03b1</i> <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist, clonidine. Cariprazine, iontophorized into the hippocampus, diminished pyramidal neuronal firing through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, while its concomitant administration did not dampen the suppressant effect of 5-HT. These results indicate that, in vivo, cariprazine acted as a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor agonist in the DRN, a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist in modulating the firing activity of LC NE neurons, and a full agonist at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors mediating the electrophysiological effect of 5-HT on pyramidal neurons. The modulatory actions of cariprazine on these monoaminergic systems may contribute to its therapeutic effectiveness in patients with depressive episodes.",

Cariprazine is a dopamine D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist, with a preference for the D3 receptor. Cariprazine is also a partial agonist at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors. The recommended dose range of cariprazine for the treatment of schizophrenia is 1.5-6 mg/d; the starting dose of 1.5 mg/d is potentially therapeutic. Cariprazine is administered once daily and is primarily metabolized in the liver through the CYP3A4 enzyme system and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. There are two active metabolites of note, desmethyl-cariprazine and didesmethyl-cariprazine; the latter's half-life is substantially longer than that for cariprazine and systemic exposure to didesmethyl-cariprazine is several times higher than that for cariprazine. Three positive, 6-week, Phase 2/3, randomized controlled trials in acute schizophrenia demonstrated superiority of cariprazine over placebo. Pooled responder rates were 31% for cariprazine 1.5-6 mg/d vs. 21% for placebo, resulting in a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. In a 26-72 week, randomized withdrawal study, significantly fewer patients relapsed in the cariprazine group compared with placebo (24.8% vs. 47.5%), resulting in an NNT of 5. The most commonly encountered adverse events (incidence \u22655% and at least twice the rate of placebo) are extrapyramidal symptoms (number needed to harm [NNH] 15 for cariprazine 1.5-3 mg/d vs. placebo and NNH 10 for 4.5-6 mg/d vs. placebo) and akathisia (NNH 20 for 1.5-3 mg/d vs. placebo and NNH 12 for 4.5-6 mg/d vs. placebo). Short-term weight gain appears small (approximately 8% of patients receiving cariprazine 1.5-6 mg/d gained \u22657% body weight from baseline, compared with 5% for those randomized to placebo, resulting in an NNH of 34). Cariprazine is associated with no clinically meaningful alterations in metabolic variables, prolactin, or the ECG QT interval. Cariprazine is also approved for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Clinical trials are ongoing in patients with acute bipolar I depression and as adjunctive treatment to antidepressant therapy in patients with major depressive disorder.",

Male Wistar rats were subjected to the CMS procedure for 7 weeks; nonstressed animals served as controls. For the last 5 weeks of the CMS procedure, rats were injected once daily with vehicle, imipramine (10 mg/kg), aripiprazole (1 and 5 mg/kg), or cariprazine (0.01, 0.03, 0.065, 0.25, and 1.0 mg/kg). Activity in reversing CMS-induced decreases in consumption of 1% solution of sucrose was measured. CMS significantly reduced sucrose intake. Imipramine, and both doses of aripiprazole and cariprazine 0.03, 0.065, and 0.25 mg/kg significantly attenuated CMS-induced reductions in sucrose intake; the lowest and highest cariprazine doses (0.01 and 1 mg/kg) did not have this effect. Cariprazine showed greater potency (ED50=0.052) relative to aripiprazole (ED50=4.4) in this model. Thus, in the rat CMS model, cariprazine showed antidepressant-like action with greater potency than aripiprazole.

Exposure to didesmethyl-cariprazine exceeded that of the parent drug. Cariprazine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6. The efficacy and safety of cariprazine have been so far investigated only in a few short-term (unpublished) clinical trials; however, three studies in schizophrenia and three studies in bipolar mania/mixed episodes evidenced a statistically significant therapeutic effect compared to placebo for cariprazine at doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 mg/d.

A potential correlation between kinetics and in vivo profiles, especially cariprazine's action on negative symptoms in schizophrenia, is investigated. The binding kinetics of four ligands were indirectly evaluated. After the receptor preparations were pre-incubated with the unlabelled ligands, the dissociation was initiated with an excess of [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone. Slow dissociation kinetics characterizes aripiprazole and cariprazine at the D<sub>2</sub> receptor. At the D<sub>3</sub> receptor, aripiprazole exhibits a slow monophasic dissociation, while cariprazine displays a rapid biphasic behaviour. Functional \u00df-arrestin assays and molecular dynamics simulations at the D<sub>3</sub> receptor confirm a biphasic binding behaviour of cariprazine. This may influence its in vivo action, as the partial agonist could react rapidly to variations in the dopamine levels of schizophrenic patients and the ligand will not quantitatively dissociate from the receptor in one single step. With these findings novel agents may be developed that display rapid, biphasic dissociation from the D<sub>3</sub>R to further investigate this effect on in vivo profiles.",

From an evolutionary perspective, spiders are the most successful venomous animals and they maintain by far the largest pool of toxic peptides. However, at present, there are no databases dedicated to spider toxins and hence it is difficult to realise their full potential as drugs, insecticides, and pharmacological probes.

Standard therapy using antibiotics is associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment strategies that target toxins, the major virulence factors, rather than the organism itself. Human monoclonal antibodies MK-3415A (actoxumab-bezlotoxumab) to <i>C. difficile</i> toxin A and toxin B, as an emerging non-antibiotic approach, significantly reduced the recurrence of CDI in animal models and human clinical trials. Although the main mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins, the impact of MK-3415A on gut microbiota and its restoration has not been examined. Using a CDI murine model, we compared the bacterial diversity of the gut microbiome of mice under different treatments including MK-3415A, vancomycin, or vancomycin combined with MK-3415A, sampled longitudinally. Here, we showed that <i>C. difficile</i> infection resulted in the prevalence of <i>Enterobacter</i> species. Sixty percent of mice in the vehicle group died after 2 days and their microbiome was almost exclusively formed by <i>Enterobacter</i>. MK-3415A treatment resulted in lower <i>Enterobacter</i> levels and restoration of <i>Blautia, Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> which were the core components of the original microbiota. Vancomycin treatment led to significantly lower survival rate than the combo treatment of MK-3415A and vancomycin. Vancomycin treatment decreased bacterial diversity with predominant <i>Enterobacter</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>, while <i>Staphylococcus</i> expanded after vancomycin treatment was terminated. In contrast, mice treated by vancomycin combined with MK-3415A also experienced decreased bacterial diversity during vancomycin treatment. However, these animals were able to recover their initial <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> proportions, even though episodes of <i>Staphylococcus</i> overgrowth were detected by the end of the experiments. In conclusion, MK-3415A (actoxumab-bezlotoxumab) treatment facilitates normalization of the gut microbiota in CDI mice.

Disease symptoms are caused by the two homologous exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. Standard therapy for CDI involves administration of antibiotics that are associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment paradigms that target the toxins rather than the organism itself. A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics. However, the exact mechanism of antibody-mediated protection is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the antitoxin antibodies are protective in multiple murine models of CDI, including systemic and local (gut) toxin challenge models, as well as primary and recurrent models of infection in mice. Systemically administered actoxumab-bezlotoxumab prevents both the damage to the gut wall and the inflammatory response, which are associated with C. difficile in these models, including in mice challenged with a strain of the hypervirulent ribotype 027. Furthermore, mutant antibodies (N297Q) that do not bind to Fc\u03b3 receptors provide a level of protection similar to that of wild-type antibodies, demonstrating that the mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins and does not involve host effector functions.

In well-designed, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials (MODIFY 1 and 2), a single infusion of bezlotoxumab, given in combination with SoC antibacterial therapy for CDI in adults, was effective in reducing CDI recurrence in the 12 weeks post-treatment, with this benefit being seen mainly in the patients at high recurrence risk. Bezlotoxumab did not impact the efficacy of the antibacterials being used to treat the CDI and, consistent with its benefits on CDI recurrence, appeared to reduce the need for subsequent antibacterials, thus minimizing further gut microbiota disruption. Longer term, there were no further CDI recurrences over 12 months' follow-up among patients who had received bezlotoxumab in MODIFY 2 and entered an extension substudy. Bezlotoxumab has low immunogenicity and is generally well tolerated, although the potential for heart failure in some patients requires consideration; cost-effectiveness data for bezlotoxumab are awaited with interest.

Median overall survival was 8\u00b75 months (95% CI 6\u00b79-9\u00b75) for gemcitabine plus axitinib (n=314, data missing for two patients) and 8\u00b73 months (6\u00b79-10\u00b73) for gemcitabine plus placebo (n=316; hazard ratio 1\u00b7014, 95% CI 0\u00b7786-1\u00b7309; one-sided p=0\u00b75436). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events for gemcitabine plus axitinib and gemcitabine plus placebo were hypertension (20 [7%] and 5 [2%] events, respectively), abdominal pain (20 [7%] and 17 [6%]), fatigue (27 [9%] and 21 [7%]), and anorexia (19 [6%] and 11 [4%]). The addition of axitinib to gemcitabine does not improve overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer.

Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3. In the randomized Phase III AXIS trial, axitinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with sorafenib, respectively (6.7 vs 4.7 months; p &lt; 0.0001), and improved objective response rate (19 vs 9%; p = 0.0001), resulting in its approval for advanced or metastatic RCC after failure of one systemic therapy. However, overall survival was similar with axitinib and sorafenib. Common adverse events associated with axitinib include diarrhea, hypertension and fatigue. The properties, clinical efficacy, adverse events, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of axitinib are summarized and its position in the overall therapeutic landscape for metastatic RCC among several targeted therapies is described. Axitinib is generally well-tolerated and provides definitive clinical benefits in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC as second-line therapy. However, as with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the same class, axitinib does not prolong overall survival; therefore, selection of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, including axitinib, must be carefully considered to maximize outcomes for each patient.",

Mutations in the corresponding genes have been directly associated with severe human cardiac and skeletal myopathies, and aberrant expression patterns have often been observed in affected muscles. Herein, we have investigated whether MLP and CFL2 are involved in common molecular mechanisms, which would promote our understanding of disease pathogenesis. We have shown for the first time, using a range of biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, that MLP binds directly to CFL2 in human cardiac and skeletal muscles. The interaction involves the inter-LIM domain, amino acids 94 to 105, of MLP and the amino-terminal domain, amino acids 1 to 105, of CFL2, which includes part of the actin depolymerization domain. The MLP/CFL2 complex is stronger in moderately acidic (pH 6.8) environments and upon CFL2 phosphorylation, while it is independent of Ca(2+) levels. This interaction has direct implications in actin cytoskeleton dynamics in regulating CFL2-dependent F-actin depolymerization, with maximal depolymerization enhancement at an MLP/CFL2 molecular ratio of 2:1. Deregulation of this interaction by intracellular pH variations, CFL2 phosphorylation, MLP or CFL2 gene mutations, or expression changes, as observed in a range of cardiac and skeletal myopathies, could impair F-actin depolymerization, leading to sarcomere dysfunction and disease.",

The purpose of this article is to present the data in the literature regarding the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of suicidality in subjects with autism spectrum disorders and to identify the factors that promote the transition to action. This review was carried out using the data set collected in Medline PubMed, items with \"autism spectrum disorder\", \"pervasive developmental disorder\", \"Asperger's syndrome\", \"suicide\", \"suicide attempt\", and \"suicide behavior\". In all subjects from our research on PubMed, 21.3% of subjects with autism spectrum disorder reported suicidal ideation, have attempted suicide or died by suicide (115 out of 539 subjects) and 7.7% of subjects supported for suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide exhibited an autism spectrum disorder (62 out of 806 subjects), all ages combined. Suicidal ideation and morbid preoccupation are particularly common in adolescents and young adults. Suicide attempts are accompanied by a willingness for death and can lead to suicide. They are more common in high-functioning autism and Asperger subjects. The methods used are often violent and potentially lethal or fatal in two cases published. Suicide risk depends on many factors that highlight the vulnerability of these subjects, following autistic and developmental symptoms. Vulnerability complicating the diagnosis of comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders are major factors associated with suicidality. Vulnerability but also directly related to suicidality, since the origin of physical and sexual abuse and victimization by peers assigning them the role of \"scapegoat\" are both responsible for acting out. Given the diversity of factors involved in the risk of suicide in this population, this does not validate \"a\" program of intervention, but the intervention of \"customized programs\". Their implementation should be as early as possible in order to treat while the brain has the greatest plasticity. The aim is to provide the necessary access to the greatest possible autonomy. Hence, including working communication skills and interaction, these subject will have independent means of protection, an essential complement to measures to protect vulnerable subjects; the vulnerability of direct and indirect suicidality. Comorbid diagnoses must take into account the specificities of these patients, their difficulties in communicating their mental state, and adapted and innovative therapeutic strategies must be offered and validated.",

However, the exact mechanism of the down-regulation of LTF in NPC has not been revealed. In the current study, we screened and identified LTF is a bona fide target of miR-214 in NPC cells. miR-214 mimics significantly suppressed LTF mRNA and protein expression levels in NPC cells. miR-214 not only can promote NPC cell proliferation and invasion abilities in vitro, but also can accelerate tumor formation and lung metastasis in a mouse xenograft model. The pro-tumor function of miR-214 was depended on LTF suppression since LTF re-expression can reverse it. miR-214 can also activate AKT signaling by suppressing LTF expression. Furthermore, miR-214 expression level was up-regulated in NPC especially in metastasis-prone NPC tumor tissues compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues, while the LTF expression level was negatively correlated with miR-214, suggesting that miR-214 targeting is partly responsible for LTF down-regulation in NPC specimens.",

Here, the expression of LTF in OSCC tissues and TCA8113 cells was detected with RT-PCR, qPCR, and IHC. And the correlation between LTF expression and OSCC metastasis was assessed. MS-PCR was performed to reveal the methylation status in promoter regions of LTF both in OSCC tissue samples and cells. The influences of 5-Aza-Cdc treatment to the methylation status and expression levels of LTF were also analyzed. At last, the functions of LTF in OSCC progression were demonstrated by MTT analysis, clone formation assay, and cell cycle analysis in TCA8113 cells with forced ectopic expression of LTF. LTF showed a low or null expression pattern in OSCC tissues and cells, at least partially, due to the hypermethylated status in promoter regions for 5-Aza-Cdc, a methyltransferase inhibitor, could restore the expression of LTF in TCA8113 cells. And the expression level of LTF exhibited a negative correlation with OSCC metastasis. Re-expression of LTF inhibited the growth, proliferation, as well as cell cycle progression of TCA8113 cells. In conclusion, hypermethylation contributes much to LTF inactivation in OSCC.

However, the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. In the current study, we revealed that LTF can suppress 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 expression via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun pathway and thus repress AKT signaling. We also showed that LTF interacts with keratin 18 (K18) and so blocks the formation of the K18-14-3-3 complex, leading to downregulation of K18-mediated AKT activation. Thus, LTF suppresses AKT signaling by two separate mechanisms, leading to inhibition of NPC tumorigenesis.

However, little is known about the role of LTF in regulating the development of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The aim of our study was to investigate whether LTF could regulate the development of NPC by characterizing the pattern of LTF expression in human NPC tissues using cDNA and tissue microarrays. Loss of LTF expression was observed in a significantly higher frequency of NPC tissues compared to that in nontumor nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues. While 61.25% of NPC tissues at the T1/T2 stage were positive for LTF expression, only 40.82% of NPC at the T3/T4 stage were stained by anti-LTF. Similarly, 41.58% of NPC with local lymph node metastasis displayed LTF expression, a value significantly lower than the 46.36% in primary tumors (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that LTF may negatively regulate the development and metastasis of NPC in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of or treatment with LTF inhibited the proliferation of NPC cells and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase in vitro. While LTF treatment downregulated expression of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), expression of p21 and p27 in 5-8F NPC cells was enhanced. Moreover, LTF treatment modulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but did not affect p53 and STAT3 expression in 5-8F NPC cells. Thus LTF is likely to be a candidate tumor suppressor and downregulates the development of NPC by inhibiting NPC proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest and modulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, our findings provide new insights in understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the action of LTF in regulating the development of human NPC.",

PD patients with \u22652 hours per day of OFF time despite oral levodopa \u22654 times per day were randomized to CVT-301 or placebo for 4 weeks, to be used up to 3 times per day for OFF episodes. After 2 weeks, the study-drug dose was escalated from 35 to 50 mg. The primary end point was mean change in UPDRS Part III score from a predose OFF state to the average of postdose scores obtained at 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes, as assessed in-clinic at the end of week 4. Home diaries were recorded. Eighty-six patients used the study drug at an average frequency of 2.1 times per day for CVT-301 and for placebo. At 4 weeks, least-squares mean change in UPDRS Part III score favored CVT-301 by 7.0 points (P &lt; 0.001). A treatment effect was evident at 10 minutes. At 4 weeks, least-squares mean OFF-time change from baseline favored CVT-301 by 0.9 hours per day (P = 0.045). The most frequently reported adverse events in the CVT-301 group were dizziness, cough, and nausea, each in 7% (3 of 43 patients). CVT-301 self-administered during OFF episodes provided rapid improvement of motor function, and daily OFF time was significantly reduced at the higher dose. CVT-301 was generally safe and well-tolerated. \u00a9 2016 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Changes in the chemical structure of synthetic oligonucleotides make them more stable and specific, and new delivery strategies became progressively available. The attention of pharmaceutical industry rapidly turned to RNAi, as an opportunity to explore new drug targets. This review addresses nine small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and one unique microRNA (miRNA) inhibitor, which entered the phase 2-3 clinical trials. The siRNAs in focus are PF-04523655, TKM-080301, Atu027, SYL040012, SYL1001, siG12D-LODER (phase 2), QPI-1002, QPI-1007, and patisiran (phase 3). Regarding miRNAs, their content can be down- or up-regulated, by using miRNA inhibitors (AntimiRs) or miRNA mimics. Miravirsen is an AntimiR-122 for hepatitis C virus infection. The flexibility of RNAi technology is easily understood taking into account: (i) the different drug targets (i.e. p53, caspase 2, PKN3, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, mutated KRAS, microRNAs); (ii) therapeutic conditions, including ophthalmic diseases, kidney injury, amyloidosis, pancreatic cancer, viral hepatitis; and (iii) routes of administration (ocular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratumoral). Although some issues are still matters of concern (delivery, toxicity, cost, and biological barriers), RNAi definitively opens a wide avenue for drug development.",

Relevant FABP2 promoter polymorphisms c.-80_-79insT, c.-136_-132delAGTAG, c.-168_-166delAAGinsT, c.-260G&gt;A, c.-471G&gt;A, and c.-778G&gt;T result in two haplotypes A and B. Activation of haplotypes by rosiglitazone stimulated PPARgamma/RXRalpha leads to 2-fold higher activity of haplotype B than A. As shown by chimeric FABP2 promoter constructs, the higher responsiveness of FABP2 haplotype B is mainly but not solely determined by polymorphism c.-471G&gt;A. As shown by EMSA and promoter-reporter assays, Oct-1 interacts with the -471 region of FABP2 promoters, induces the activities of both FABP2 promoter haplotypes and abolishes the different activities of haplotypes induced by rosiglitazone activated PPARgamma/RXRalpha. In conclusion, our findings suggest a functional role of PPARgamma/RXRalpha and Oct-1 in the regulation of the FABP2 gene.",

HNF-1alpha activates an FABP2 promoter luciferase construct by 3.5 and 20-fold in Caco-2 and Hela cells, respectively. Mutational analysis of HNF-1alpha elements resulted in about 50% reduction of basal and HNF-1alpha induced activity of FABP2 promoter constructs, predominantly caused by deletion of the -185 to -165 site. Thus, our data suggest a major role of HNF-1alpha in control of FABP2 expression in intestine via a functional HNF-1alpha recognition element within FABP2 promoter region -185 to -165.",

We show in luciferase reporter gene assays by a series of chimeric FABP2 promoter constructs in intestinal Caco-2 cells that polymorphism c.-80_-79insT essentially determines different activities of the FABP2 promoter. In accordance, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transcriptional factors GATA-5 and -6 bind with higher binding affinities to the FABP2 promoter region containing the -80A allele compared to B. As functional consequence, haplotype A is twice as much more activated by GATA factors than haplotype B in liver Huh7 cells. Additionally, a construct bearing the -80B allele in the background of haplotype A reversed the activity from A to B. Thus, the GATA mediated differential activation of FABP2 haplotypes depends on polymorphism c.-80_-79insT.

However, it is still unclear whether Msi1-positive cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells have the ability to differentiate into neural or intestinal epithelial cells. A pMsi1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter plasmid was constructed in order to sort Msi1-positive cells out of the differentiated cell population. The GFP-positive cells (i.e. Msi1-positive cells) were sorted by FACS and were hypodermically engrafted into the backs of NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) mice. The presence of neural and intestinal epithelial cells in the grafts was detected. Msi1 was highly expressed in the GFP-positive cells, but not in the GFP-negative cells. The markers for neural cells (Nestin and Tubulin \u03b2 III) and intestinal epithelial cells [FABP2 (fatty acid binding protein 2), Lyz (lysozyme) and ChA (chromogranin A)] were more highly expressed in the grafts from Msi1-positive cells than those from Msi1-negative cells (P&lt;0.05).

Since its original description, approximately 50 cases have been reported with various clinical signs and symptoms. Characteristics include progressive neurologic deterioration with extrapyramidal involvement and polyendocrinopathy most notable for hypogonadism starting in early adolescence. Clinical presentation is variable, and a subset of patients may have additional features, such as premature aging, alopecia, distinctive facial features, cognitive impairment, or deafness. CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. Despite identical genetic alteration, our 5 patients had various clinical features among them and compared with previously reported cases with the same pathogenic mutation. CONCLUSIONS The phenotypic variability of WSS due to c.436delC founder mutation may have a wider range than previously recognized.",

The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the <i>DCAF17</i> gene. The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of brain MR imaging abnormalities in Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome. We reviewed brain MR images of 26 patients with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (12 males, 14 females; age range, 16-45 years; mean age, 26.6 years). Follow-up studies were conducted for 6 patients. All patients had abnormal MR imaging findings. The most common abnormalities were a small pituitary gland (76.9%), pronounced basal ganglia iron deposition (73%), and white matter lesions in 69.2%. White matter lesions showed frontoparietal and periventricular predominance. All white matter lesions spared subcortical U-fibers and were nonenhanced. Prominent perivascular spaces (15.3%) and restricted diffusion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (7.6%) were less frequent findings. Follow-up studies showed expansion of white matter lesions with iron deposition further involving the red nucleus and substantia nigra. Older age was associated with a more severe degree of white matter lesions (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Small pituitary gland, accentuated iron deposition in the globus pallidus, and nonenhancing frontoparietal/periventricular white matter lesions were the most noted abnormalities seen in our cohort. The pattern and extent of these findings were observed to correlate with older age, reflecting a possible progressive myelin destruction and/or axonal loss. The presence of pituitary hypoplasia and white matter lesions can further distinguish Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome from other neurodegenerative diseases with brain iron accumulation subtypes.",

Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS. Considerable phenotypic heterogeneity exists in WSS with regard to severity, organs involvement and age of onset, both in inter-familial and intra-familial cases. In this study, the genetic characterization of a consanguineous pedigree showing mild features of WSS was performed, followed by structural analysis of truncated protein. Exome sequencing identified a novel single base deletion variant (c.270delA; K90Nfs8*) in third exon of the gene DCAF17 (RefSeq; NM_025000), resulting in a truncated protein. Structural analysis of truncated DCAF17 revealed absence of amino acid residues crucial for interaction with DDB1. Taken together, the data confirmed the single base pair deletion as the underlying cause of this second report of WSS from Pakistan.

Both required hormone treatment to produce secondary sex characteristics and pubertal development beyond Tanner 1. SNP array analysis of both probands was performed to detect shared regions of homozygosity which may harbor homozygous mutations in a gene causing their common features of abnormal pubertal development, alopecia, and variable cognitive delay. Our patients shared multiple homozygous genomic regions; ten shared regions were &gt;1 Mb in length and constituted 0.99% of the genome. DCAF17, encoding a transmembrane nuclear protein of uncertain function, was the only gene identified in a homozygous region known to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Sequencing of the coding exons and flanking intronic regions of DCAF17 in the proband revealed homozygosity for a previously described founder mutation (c.436delC). Targeted DCAF17 sequencing of his affected sibling revealed the same homozygous mutation. This family illustrates the utility of SNP array testing in consanguineous families to efficiently and inexpensively identify regions of genomic homozygosity in which genetic candidates for recessive conditions can be identified.",

Moreover, correlation between diseases and the shortening (or lengthening) of 3' UTRs has been reported in the literature. This length is largely determined by the polyadenylation cleavage site in the mRNA. As alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites are common in mammalian genes, several tools have been published recently for detecting APA sites from RNA-Seq data or performing shortening/lengthening analysis. These tools consider either up to only two APA sites in a gene or only APA sites that occur in the last exon of a gene, although a gene may generally have more than two APA sites and an APA site may sometimes occur before the last exon. Furthermore, the tools are unable to integrate the analysis of shortening/lengthening events with APA site detection. We propose a new tool, called TAPAS, for detecting novel APA sites from RNA-Seq data. It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or shortening/lengthening analysis significantly. https://github.com/arefeen/TAPAS.

Multiple publically available pipelines combining high profiling technologies and bioinformatics tools have been developed to catalog changes in 3'-UTR lengths. In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3'-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR function, led to the development of ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic \"tone\" by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for \"GABAergic\" ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs. Manipulation of subunit expression patterns or novel ASDs targeting the altered receptors may provide a novel approach for seizure prevention.",

In recent years, many newer antiepileptic drugs have been investigated as add-on therapy for partial epilepsy; losigamone is one of these drugs and is the focus of this systematic review. To investigate the efficacy and safety of losigamone when used as an add-on therapy for partial epilepsy. We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (1 May 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 4 of 12, The Cochrane Library, 2012) and MEDLINE (1 May 2012). We searched trials registers and contacted the manufacturer of losigamone and authors of included studies for additional information. There were no language restrictions. Randomized controlled add-on trials comparing losigamone with placebo for partial epilepsy. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency and seizure freedom; the secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawal and adverse events. Results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or 99% CIs (for the individual listed adverse events to make an allowance for multiple testing). Two trials involving a total of 467 patients were eligible for inclusion. Both trials assessed losigamone 1200 or 1500 mg/d as an add-on therapy for partial epilepsy. One trial was assessed as being of good methodologic quality while the other was of uncertain quality. For the efficacy outcomes, results did show patients taking losigamone were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.75; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.72), but associated with a significant increase of treatment withdrawal when compared with those taking placebo (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.67). For the safety outcomes, results indicated the proportion of patients who experienced adverse events in the losigamone group was higher than the placebo group (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.80), dizziness was the only adverse event significantly in relation to losigamone (RR 3.82; 99% CI 1.69 to 8.64). The proportion of patients achieving seizure freedom was not reported in either trial report. A subgroup analysis according to different doses of losigamone showed that a higher dose of losigamone (1500 mg/d) is associated with a greater reduction in seizure frequency than lower doses, but is also associated with more dropouts due to adverse events. The results of this review showed losigamone can reduce seizure frequency but was associated with more treatment withdrawals when used as an add-on therapy for people with partial epilepsy. However, trials included were of short-term duration and uncertain quality. Future well-designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with a longer-term duration are needed.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15638775": "Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological syndromes in the world today. Epilepsy describes a group of brain disorders whose symptoms and causes are diverse and complicated, but all share a common behavioural manifestation: the seizure. Seizures result from the abnormal discharge of groups of neurons within the brain, usually within a focal point, that can result in the recruitment of large brain regions into epileptiform activity. Although the range of explanations for the development of seizures can be as varied as genetic composition to acute head trauma, the net result is often similar. The excitability of neurons is governed by the input they receive from their neighbours and the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. In this review we focus on elements that are crucial to determining the intrinsic excitability of neurons in the CNS, the voltage gated ion channels (VGICs). VGICs as well as being important for physiological function are critical in producing hyperexcitability such as that associated with seizure discharges. Many drugs routinely used in the clinical setting, as well as several novel experimental drugs, have shown interactions with VGICs that underpin, at least in part, their anticonvulsant action. We review the physiological roles of voltage gated ion channels that are selective for sodium, potassium and calcium conductance and attempt to highlight their role in the pathology of epilepsy. This is supplemented by the mechanisms of drug action at these important anticonvulsant targets for classical and clinically relevant compounds (e.g. phenytoin, ethosuximide) as well as some important second generation drugs (e.g. gabapentin, levetiracetam) and novel experimental agents (e.g. retigabine, losigamone, safinamide). We also briefly discuss the urgent need for new drugs in this arena and the potential of combinatorial methods and recombinant screening to identify leads.",

This phase I study consisted of 3 periods with an uncontrolled first period and a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design in the second and third period. All subjects received a single dose of 200 mg losigamone (1 tablet) in period 1 (on day 14) as well as multiple doses of losigamone (3 tablets = 600 mg per day) or placebo for 15 days in periods 2 and 3. During all three periods an oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg levonorgestrel was given. Single-dose pharmacokinetics was investigated on day 14 of period 1. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic investigations were performed on day 15 of periods 2 and 3. The samples were assayed to derive pharmacokinetic data of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. In addition, the concentrations of losigamone racemate (AO-33) and its enantiomers AO-242 and AO-294 were determined in these samples. The mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and Cmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel after multiple-dose treatment with losigamone or placebo were quite similar and met the criteria for bioequivalence. The 90% confidence intervals of the log-transformed ratios of the geometric means of the primary pharmacokinetic variables were included in the respective acceptance ranges of 80% to 125% (AUC) and 70% to 143% (Cmax). The study demonstrated that multiple doses of losigamone did not influence the multiple dose kinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. The single- and multiple-dose kinetics of 200 mg losigamone and its enantiomeres did not differ from each other in a significant way. The combination of losigamone and the combined oral contraceptive was well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred. It can be stated that the antiepileptic drug losigamone and the combined contraceptive do not interact each others metabolism.",

In a multi-center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, patients received one of three 12-week treatments: placebo, LSG 1200 mg/day, or 1500 mg/day, in addition to up to three standard anticonvulsants after a prospective period of 12 weeks to assess baseline seizure frequency. The primary efficacy measure was the relative reduction of seizure frequency per 4 weeks in the double-blind phase as compared to baseline. In the intention-to-treat population of 264 patients, the relative median reduction of partial seizure frequency was 3.3% for placebo, 19.7% for LSG 1200 mg/day, and 25.3% for LSG 1500 mg/day. The differences of both LSG groups versus placebo were significant (P&lt;0.01, two-tailed). In the responder analysis, 11.8% of the patients in the placebo group, 17.2% in the LSG 1200 mg/day group, and 29.3% in the LSG 1500 mg/day group showed a seizure reduction versus baseline of at least 50%. A positive association between dosage and response was observed (P=0.003). Adverse events during treatment were reported by 58.8% of the patients for placebo, by 62.1% for LSG 1200 mg/day and by 76.1% for LSG 1500 mg/day. Most events in the LSG groups occurred during the first 4 weeks of double-blind (during or immediately after up-titration) and subsided quickly. Over the last 4 weeks of treatment, the incidence of adverse events in the LSG groups was close to the placebo level. Based on the study's results, LSG is an effective and safe add-on drug for refractory partial epilepsy in adults.",

Cultures were treated either at an early (day 5 to day 14) or at an advanced (day 20 to day 28) developmental stage, and assayed for changes in the activities of the cell type-specific enzymes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), glutamine synthetase (GS) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNP). Five drugs (carbamazepine, diazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate), currently used in the treatment of epileptic patients, were tested together with losigamone, a recently developed anticonvulsant. The results show distinct, concentration-dependent patterns of biochemical changes for the different drugs. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, losigamone and diazepam greatly reduced GAD, ChAT and AChE activities, indicating a relatively high neuron-specific toxic potential. Diazepam produced a more general pattern of toxicity and, in contrast to the anticonvulsants, showed higher toxicity in less-differentiated cultures. Phenobarbital and valproate slightly but significantly increased the activities of several enzymes. The patterns of concentration-dependent effects observed in this three-dimensional cell culture system are in good agreement with the presumed neurotoxic and/or teratogenic potential of these drugs.",

These patients require more than one antiepileptic drug. In animal models of epilepsy, it is possible to determine which combinations produce supra-additive anticonvulsive effects with minimal or even no adverse reactions. The experimental data can be helpful for predicting effective drug combinations in patients with refractory epilepsy. Losigamone is a new antiepileptic drug with an unknown mechanism of action. The drug belongs to the group of beta-methoxy-butenolides, and exists as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (AO-242 and AO-294). The drug is eliminated by oxidation. Cytochrome CYP2A6 appears to be the main isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of losigamone. In vitro, losigamone exerts anticonvulsant activity in the picrotoxin model in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, the low Ca(2+) model in CA1 area and the low Mg(2+) model in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In vivo, the drug exhibits significant efficacy against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rodents and pentetrazole-induced clonic convulsions in mice. Potency of losigamone varies with the respective seizure test, animal species used in experiments and route of drug administration. Toxicity studies do not indicate any teratogenic risk of the drug, at least in animals. In clinical trial, losigamone proved to have satisfactory effectiveness and good tolerance in the treatment of partial and secondary generalized seizures. The enantiomer AO-242 seems to be more potent than AO-294 or racemate.",

PCSK9 mAbs are already in limited clinical use and are the subject of major cardiovascular outcomes trials, which, if universally positive, could see much wider clinical application of these agents. Patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia are the most obvious candidates for these drugs, but other patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, statin intolerance or hyperlipoproteinaemia(a) may also benefit.

At day 180, non-HDL-C was lowered dose-dependently: by 25% from 148\u00b143 to 110\u00b145 mg/dL in the 200-mg single-dose group and by 46% from 161\u00b158 to 91\u00b158 mg/dL in the 2-dose 300-mg group. For the same dosing regimens, apo B was reduced by 23% from 101\u00b123 to 78\u00b129 mg/dL and by 41% from 106\u00b131 to 65\u00b133 mg/dL ( P&lt;0.001 for all groups versus placebo). In the 300-mg 2-dose group, all individuals experienced apo B and non-HDL-C reductions. There was larger interindividual variation in very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a) reductions. In the 300-mg 2-dose group, the percentages of patients achieving guideline-recommended apo B goals for high- and very-high-risk patients at day 180 were 78% and 90%; 68% and 83% of participants achieved non-HDL-C &lt;100 and &lt;130 mg/dL. Inclisiran produces significant and prolonged reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins, suggesting that inhibiting the synthesis of protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 through siRNA may be a viable alternative to other approaches that target protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.

Additionally, the currently recommended LDL target goal of 70 mg/dl does not diminish the CV risk entirely leaving behind some residual risk. Previous attempts to maximally lower the LDL levels with statin monotherapy have met dejection due to the increased side effects associated with the treatment. Nevertheless, with the new advancements in clinical medicine, it has now become possible to bring down the LDL levels to as low as 15 mg/dl using PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination with statins. The development of inclisiran, siRNA silencer targeting PCSK9 gene, is a one step forward in these endeavors. Moreover, various studies aiming to lower the CV risk and mortality by lowering LDL levels have demonstrated encouraging results. The current challenge is to explore this arena to redefine the target LDL levels, if required, to avoid any suboptimal treatment. After thorough literature search in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar, we present this article to provide a brief overview of the safety and efficacy of lowering LDL below the current goal.",

Initially, the therapeutic approaches to reduce circulating levels of PCSK9 were focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies. To that effect, evolocumab and alirocumab, two human monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9, given on a background of statin therapy, have been shown to markedly decrease LDL-C levels and significantly reduce cardiovascular risk. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules have been used recently to target the hepatic production of PCSK9. siRNA interferes with the expression of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences by affecting the degradation of mRNA post-transcription, thus preventing translation. Inclisiran is a long-acting, synthetic siRNA directed against PCSK9 and it has been shown to significantly decrease hepatic production of PCSK9 and cause a marked reduction in LDL-C levels.

Recent studies suggest that dietary intake or supplementation of natural flavonoids like hesperidin can be used for therapy of patients with brain injury and depression. However, the exact mechanisms by which hesperidin indicates its neuroprotective effects are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of hesperidin on depression-related symptoms in a mouse model of mTBI, and that what mechanisms are primarily involved in the antidepressant effects of this bioflavonoid. Ten days after mTBI-induction, mice received oral hesperidin treatment (50 mg/kg/14 days), then animals were subjected to different depression tests including sucrose preference test, forced swim test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, and tail suspension test. We also measured levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin-(IL)-1\u03b2, malondialdehyde (MDA), and brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Our results show that mTBI induction induced depressive-like behaviors in mice by increasing inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) and oxidative stress marker (MDA), and reducing BDNF levels in the hippocampus. Interestingly, hesperidin treatment was effective to significantly reduce depression-related symptoms in mTBI-induced mice. In addition, hesperidin decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MDA, and increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus. The major strength of our study is that four behavioral tests gave similar results.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage was created by injecting 0.15 cc of autologous blood taken from the rat-tail artery and injected into the cisterna magna from the craniocervical junction. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally as twice daily doses for 48 hours. Rats were euthanized at the end of this period. No statistically significant decrease was observed in malondialdehyde levels, which is the end-product of lipid peroxidation, among the drug groups (G4 and G5). Thin sections prepared from the basilar artery were examined morphologically. Severe luminal narrowing and vessel-wall thickening were observed in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3). In the hesperidin-administered groups (G4, G5), it was determined that vessel wall thickness measurements revealed thinner walls than in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3) and the luminal diameters were significantly larger than in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3).

Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression. Finally, hesperidin treatment improved electrophysiological function, measured with visual evoked potential, and visual function, measured with optomotry. Thus, we found that hesperidin suppressed a number of cytotoxic factors associated with NMDA-induced cell death signaling, such as oxidative stress, over-activation of calpain, and inflammation, thereby protecting the RGCs in mice.

Immunohistochemical staining of cortices, striata and hippocampi showed patches of iNOS positive cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells. Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%, 20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by 3-NP.

Following PTZ challenge, severity of convulsions (onset of jerks, myoclonic seizures, extensor phase and death), brain anti-oxidant enzyme levels and mitochondrial complex enzymes activities were estimated. Single i.p. PTZ (80 mg/kg) challenge demonstrated severe convulsions, oxidative damage (raised lipid peroxidation [LPO], nitrite concentration as well as depleted reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase levels), and depletion of mitochondrial enzyme Complex (I, II, IV) activities. Hesp (200 mg/kg), DZP (0.5 mg/kg) and Gbp (20 mg/kg) pretreatments attenuated PTZ induced behavioral, biochemical and mitochondrial alterations. However, administration of Hesp (100 mg/kg) in combination with DZP (0.2 mg/kg) or Gbp (10 mg/kg) potentiated their neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects in PTZ treated animals.

The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of hesperidin on two NSCLC-derived cell lines, A549 and NCI-H358, were determined using a WST-1 colorimetric assay, a LDH cytotoxicity assay, a Cell Death Detection assay, an AnnexinV-FITC assay, a caspase-3 assay and a JC-1 assay, respectively, all in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As a control, non-cancerous MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were included. Changes in whole genome gene expression profiles were assessed using an Illumina Human HT-12v4 beadchip microarray platform, and subsequent data analyses were performed using an Illumina Genome Studio and Ingenuity Pathway Analyser (IPA). We found that after hesperidin treatment, A549 and NCI-H358 cells exhibited decreasing cell proliferation and increasing caspase-3 and other apoptosis-related activities, in conjunction with decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential activities, in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

The apoptosis in rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3 and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function, and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line.",

Both hesperidin and hesperetin exhibited similar patterns of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activities. While hesperidin was inactive, hesperetin was found to be a potent antioxidant, inhibiting lipid peroxidation initiated in rat brain homogenates by Fe2+ and L-ascorbic acid. In consistence with these findings, hesperetin protected primary cultured cortical cells against the oxidative neuronal damage induced by H2O2 or xanthine and xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands, only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study. Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases.",

In this study, we used a toxic A\u03b21-42 peptide to impair insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in Neuro-2A cells, and this study also hypothesized that A\u03b2-induced autophagy might be emerging as a key process regulating neuronal glucose uptake. Additionally, hesperetin and hesperidin were used to test the neuroprotective effect against A\u03b2-induced impairment of glucose utilization. Our data found that A\u03b2-stimulated autophagy activation promoted the phenomenon of impairment of neuronal energy metabolism, including glucose uptake, glucose transporters (GLUTs), and insulin signaling cascades. In this study, confocal images of autophagy punctate further confirmed that downregulation of A\u03b2-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin improved A\u03b2-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting A\u03b2-induced autophagy in neuronal cells. These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease progression.",

Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels or protein kinase C. In hippocampal slice preparations, whole-cell patch clamp experiments showed that hesperidin reduced the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents without affecting their amplitude, indicating the involvement of a presynaptic mechanism. In addition, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of kainic acid (KA, 15 mg/kg) elevated the extracellular glutamate levels and caused considerable neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 area. These KA-induced alterations were attenuated by pretreatment with hesperidin (10 or 50 mg/kg, i.p.) before administering the KA. These results demonstrate that hesperidin inhibits evoked glutamate release in vitro and attenuates in vivo KA-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus. Our findings indicate that hesperidin may be a promising candidate for preventing or treating glutamate excitotoxicity related brain disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases.",

Unilateral intrastriatal administration of QA (300 nmol/4 \u00b5l) significantly reduced body weight, impaired behavior (locomotor activity, beam balance and memory performance), caused oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, depleted super oxide dismutase and reduced glutathione), demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-\u03b1, caspase-3 as well as BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.) treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in rats.",

Several studies have been performed in order to evaluate the effects of hesperidin as anti-inflammatory agent using cellular and animal models and few clinical trials. Hesperidin treatment decreased inflammatory mediators and exerted significant antioxidant effects. The molecular basis for its anti-inflammatory effects seems to be mediated by signalling pathways especially the nuclear factor \u03ba\u03b2 pathway.

Treatment with COG112 significantly reduced neuroinflammation in AICD mice and protected against impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We also found that COG112 treatment reduced hyperphosphorylation and somatodendritic accumulation of tau in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AICD mice. Reduction of neuroinflammation by the apoE-mimetic COG112 protects against impaired neurogenesis and tau pathology in AICD transgenic mice.

These complex and heterogeneous diseases are characterized by extensive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) accompanied by retraction and severance of their axonal connections to the brain and thus damage to and thinning of the optic nerve. Since patients suffering from this glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) first notice visual impairment when they have lost &gt; 40% of their RGCs, early diagnosis is the key to retard the progression of glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), low cerebrospinal and/or low intracranial fluid pressure, advancing age, and ethnicity are major risk factors associated with POAG. However, retinal vascular abnormalities and a high sensitivity of RGCs and optic nerve head components to neurotoxic, inflammatory, oxidative and mechanical insults also contribute to vision loss in POAG/GON. Current treatment modalities for POAG and NTG involve lowering IOP using topical ocular drugs, combination drug products, and surgical interventions. Two recently approved multi-pharmacophoric drugs (e.g., rho kinase inhibitor, Netarsudil; a drug conjugate, Latanoprostene Bunod) and novel aqueous humor drainage devices (iStent and CyPass) are also gaining acceptance for treating POAG/ NTG. Neuroprotective and regenerative agents, coupled with electroceutical, mechanical support systems, stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are emerging therapeutics on the horizon to help combat GON.

The critical discovery that pharmacologic manipulation of the cytoskeleton of outflow pathway cells decreased outflow resistance placed a spotlight on the Rho kinase pathway that was known to regulate the cytoskeleton. Ultimately, a search for Rho kinase inhibitors led to the discovery of several molecules of therapeutic interest, leaving us today with 2 new ocular hypotensive agents approved for clinical use: ripasudil in Japan and netarsudil in the United States.

Taking gastric cancer as an example, its molecular classification is built on genome abnormalities, but it lacks acceptable clinical characteristics. Pathologists are expected to act as \"genetic interpreters\" or \"genetic translators\" and build a link between molecular subtypes with tumor histological features. Subsequently, by using their findings, oncologists will carry out targeted therapy based on molecular classification.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26242768": "The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13(\u00ae), Prevnar 13(\u00ae)) [PCV13] consists of 13 serotype-specific polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), each covalently conjugated to a non-toxic immunogenic carrier protein. PCV13 has a well established immunogenicity and tolerability profile in adults, particularly those \u226550 years of age. Results of CAPiTA, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in &gt;84,000 older adults aged \u226565 years, showed that PCV13 was effective in preventing vaccine-type pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), vaccine-type pneumococcal nonbacteraemic (noninvasive) CAP and vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). These findings, along with changes in pneumococcal serotype distribution and epidemiology of pneumococcal disease, prompted the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to recommend PCV13 in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPVS23) for all adults aged \u226565 years. PCV13 also has a role in preventing pneumococcal disease (pneumonia and IPD) in younger adults with immunocompromising conditions and potentially in those with other underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of pneumococcal disease.",

POI is heterogeneous with only a few causative genes having been discovered so far. Our objective was to determine the genetic cause of POI in a consanguineous Lebanese family with two affected sisters presenting with primary amenorrhoea and an absence of any pubertal development. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed. Whole-exome sequencing was done on the proband. Linkage analysis identified a locus on chromosome 7 where exome sequencing successfully identified a homozygous two base pair duplication (c.1947_48dupCT), leading to a truncated protein p.(Y650Sfs*22) in the STAG3 gene, confirming it as the cause of POI in this family. Exome sequencing combined with linkage analyses offers a powerful tool to efficiently find novel genetic causes of rare, heterogeneous disorders, even in small single families. This is only the second report of a STAG3 variant; the first STAG3 variant was recently described in a phenotypically similar family with extreme POI. Identification of an additional family highlights the importance of STAG3 in POI pathogenesis and suggests it should be evaluated in families affected with POI.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006057": " Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterized by primary or secondary amenorrhea, infertility, low estradiol levels, and increased gonadotropin levels. Most cases of POI remain unsolved even after exhaustive investigation. Here, we performed a targeted massively parallel sequencing to identify the genetic diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in a Brazilian patient. An adopted 21-year-old Brazilian woman with isolated POI was selected. A custom SureSelect<sup>XT</sup> DNA target enrichment panel was designed and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer. The variants were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Two rare heterozygous pathogenic variants in the STAG3 gene were identified in our patient. An unpublished 1-bp duplication c.291dupC (p.Asn98Glnfs*2) and one stop codon variant c.1950C &gt; A (p.Tyr650*) were identified in the STAG3 gene. Both undescribed heterozygous variants were absent in the public databases [1000Genomes, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server (NHLBI/EVS), database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP), Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)], and Online Archive of Brazilian Mutations (ABraOM) databases. Moreover, neither heterozygous variants were found in 400 alleles from fertile Brazilian women screened by Sanger sequencing. The parents' DNA was not available to segregate these variants. Our results suggested that POI is caused by pathogenic compound heterozygous variants in the STAG3 gene, supporting the key role of the STAG3 gene in the etiology of primary ovarian insufficiency.",

A novel homozygous truncating mutation of NOBOX was confirmed to exhibit a loss-of-function effect using well-defined molecular and functional analyses. Several NOBOX mutations have been reported to be associated with POI but all of them are heterozygous mutations. This is a cross sectional study in 96 patients diagnosed with POI and 211 women not diagnosed with POI in China. Blood samples collected from the participants were subjected to whole exome sequencing. Full-length transcript of NOBOX was cloned directly from human fetal ovary (FO). Functional analysis was performed for a NOBOX sequence variant associated with POI. One novel homozygous truncating variant, chr7:144098161delC, in the NOBOX gene was found in a POI patient. The truncating variant showed a severe defect in transcriptional activation of GDF9 a well-known target NOBOX. Furthermore, using real-time quantitative PCR analysis, we found many oocyte-related genes were expressed at lower level in truncating variant cells than in control cells. In addition, we found that the truncated NOBOX lost its ability to induce the G2/M arrest.Notably, our results confirmed that the 1725 bp NOBOX transcript is expressed in human FO and is the only functional isoform in transcriptional activation assays. Although the in vitro assays demonstrated the loss-of-function effect of truncating mutation on NOBOX transcriptional activation, further studies are needed to validate its long-term effects on folliculogenesis and POI. This is the first homozygous mutation of NOBOX associated with POI showing a loss-of-function effect using well-defined molecular and functional analyses. These results will aid both researchers and clinicians in understanding the molecular pathology of NOBOX and POI to develop diagnostic assays or therapeutic approaches.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29186450": " Split-networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that have proven to be a powerful tool in phylogenetics. Various ways have been developed for computing such networks, including split-decomposition, NeighborNet, QNet and FlatNJ. Some of these approaches are implemented in the user-friendly SplitsTree software package. However, to give the user the option to adjust and extend these approaches and to facilitate their integration into analysis pipelines, there is a need for robust, open-source implementations of associated data structures and algorithms. Here, we present SPECTRE, a readily available, open-source library of data structures written in Java, that comes complete with new implementations of several pre-published algorithms and a basic interactive graphical interface for visualizing planar split networks. SPECTRE also supports the use of longer running algorithms by providing command line interfaces, which can be executed on servers or in High Performance Computing environments. Full source code is available under the GPLv3 license at: https://github.com/maplesond/SPECTRE. SPECTRE's core library is available from Maven Central at: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/uk.ac.uea.cmp.spectre/core.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24436254": "Split networks are a type of phylogenetic network that allow visualization of conflict in evolutionary data. We present a new method for constructing such networks called FlatNetJoining (FlatNJ). A key feature of FlatNJ is that it produces networks that can be drawn in the plane in which labels may appear inside of the network. For complex data sets that involve, for example, non-neutral molecular markers, this can allow additional detail to be visualized as compared to previous methods such as split decomposition and NeighborNet. We illustrate the application of FlatNJ by applying it to whole HIV genome sequences, where recombination has taken place, fluorescent proteins in corals, where ancestral sequences are present, and mitochondrial DNA sequences from gall wasps, where biogeographical relationships are of interest. We find that the networks generated by FlatNJ can facilitate the study of genetic variation in the underlying molecular sequence data and, in particular, may help to investigate processes such as intra-locus recombination. FlatNJ has been implemented in Java and is freely available at www.uea.ac.uk/computing/software/flatnj.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17119010": "We present QNet, a method for constructing split networks from weighted quartet trees. QNet can be viewed as a quartet analogue of the distance-based Neighbor-Net (NNet) method for network construction. Just as NNet, QNet works by agglomeratively computing a collection of circular weighted splits of the taxa set which is subsequently represented by a planar split network. To illustrate the applicability of QNet, we apply it to a previously published Salmonella data set. We conclude that QNet can provide a useful alternative to NNet if distance data are not available or a character-based approach is preferred. Moreover, it can be used as an aid for determining when a quartet-based tree-building method may or may not be appropriate for a given data set. QNet is freely available for download.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149316": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a ligand for clearance of lipoprotein remnants such as chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins. It has anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, there is extensive ongoing research to create peptides that can mimic properties of apoE. A number of synthetic peptides that encompass different regions of apoE have been studied for inhibiting inflammatory states, including Alzheimer disease. However, peptides that clear atherogenic lipoproteins, analogous to apoE, via enhanced hepatic uptake have not been previously reviewed. Toward this end, we describe the design and studies of a dual-domain apoE mimetic peptide, Ac-hE18A-NH(2). This peptide consists of residues 141-150, the putative receptor-binding region of human apoE, covalently linked to a well characterized class A amphipathic helix, 18A, which has no sequence homology to any other exchangeable apolipoprotein sequences. It demonstrates dramatic effects in reducing plasma cholesterol levels in dyslipidemic mouse and rabbit models. We discuss the scientific rationale and review the literature for the design and efficacy of the peptide. Analogous to apoE, this peptide bypasses the low-density lipoprotein receptor for the hepatic uptake of atherogenic lipoproteins via heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). ApoE mimetics such as Ac-hE18A-NH(2) may therefore restore or replace ligands in genetically induced hyperlipidemias to enable reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins via HSPG even in the absence of functional low-density lipoprotein receptors. Therefore, this and similar peptides may be useful in the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders such as familial hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30299483": " Macrophages are major targets for HIV-1, contribute to viral propagation in vivo, and are instrumental in the pathogenesis of HAND. While it is known that host sex affects HIV-1 viremia and influences the severity of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disease, a cellular or molecular basis for these findings remains elusive. We explored whether sex affects HIV-1 infectivity of primary human macrophages and CD4+ T cells in vitro. Macrophages derived from female donors were less susceptible to HIV-1 infection than those derived from males. This sex-dependent difference in macrophage infectivity was independent of the requirement for CD4/CCR5-mediated virus entry and was not observed in CD4+ T cells. Investigations into the mechanism governing these sex-dependent differences revealed that the host restriction factor SAMHD1 exists in a hyperphosphorylated, less active state in male-derived macrophages. In addition, the major kinase responsible for SAMHD1 phosphorylation, CDK1, exhibited lower levels of expression in female-derived macrophages in all tested donor pairs. The sex-dependent differences in viral restriction imposed by SAMHD1 were abrogated upon its depletion. We conclude that SAMHD1 is an essential modulator of infectivity in a sex-dependent manner in macrophages, constituting a novel component of sex differences in innate immune control of HIV-1."
