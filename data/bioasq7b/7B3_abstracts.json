Anlotinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has already shown antitumor effects in various types of carcinoma in a phase I clinical trial. In this study, we aimed to better understand the effect and efficacy of anlotinib against thyroid carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that anlotinib inhibits the cell viability of papillary thyroid cancer and ATC cell lines, likely due to abnormal spindle assembly, G2/M arrest, and activation of TP53 upon anlotinib treatment. Moreover, anlotinib suppresses the migration of thyroid cancer cells in vitro and the growth of xenograft thyroid tumors in mice. Our data demonstrate that anlotinib has significant anticancer activity in thyroid cancer, and potentially offers an effective therapeutic strategy for patients of advanced thyroid cancer type.",

This study evaluates the efficacy of AL3818 studying tumor regression in an orthotopic murine endometrial cancer model. We tested the cytotoxicity of AL3818 on a panel of 7 human endometrial cancer cell lines expressing either wild-type or mutant FGFR2 and also assessed the in vivo antitumor efficacy in a murine, orthotopic AN3CA endometrial cancer model. AL3818 was administered daily per os either alone or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, which represent the current standard of adjuvant care for endometrial cancer. AL3818 significantly reduces AN3CA cell number in vitro, characterized by high expression of a mutated FGFR2 protein. Daily oral administration of AL3818 (5 mg/kg) resulted in a complete response in 55% of animals treated and in a reduced tumor volume, as well as decreased tumor weights of AN3CA tumors by 94% and 96%, respectively, following a 29-day treatment cycle. Whereas carboplatin and paclitaxel failed to alter tumor growth, the combination with AL3818 did not seem to exhibit a superior effect when compared with AL3818 treatment alone. AL3818 shows superior efficacy for the treatment of endometrial cancer irresponsive to conventional carboplatin and paclitaxel combination and warrants further investigation.",

However, because of their low selectivity, most small molecule inhibitors of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase show unexpected adverse effects and limited anticancer efficacy. In the present study, we detailed the pharmacological properties of anlotinib, a highly potent and selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, in preclinical models. Anlotinib occupied the ATP-binding pocket of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase and showed high selectivity and inhibitory potency (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt;1 nmol/L) for VEGFR2 relative to other tyrosine kinases. Concordant with this activity, anlotinib inhibited VEGF-induced signaling and cell proliferation in HUVEC with picomolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. However, micromolar concentrations of anlotinib were required to inhibit tumor cell proliferation directly in vitro. Anlotinib significantly inhibited HUVEC migration and tube formation; it also inhibited microvessel growth from explants of rat aorta in vitro and decreased vascular density in tumor tissue in vivo. Compared with the well-known tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib, once-daily oral dose of anlotinib showed broader and stronger in vivo antitumor efficacy and, in some models, caused tumor regression in nude mice. Collectively, these results indicate that anlotinib is a well-tolerated, orally active VEGFR2 inhibitor that targets angiogenesis in tumor growth, and support ongoing clinical evaluation of anlotinib for a variety of malignancies.",

In this research, we demonstrated that anlotinib, a potent multi-tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI), showed a significant inhibitory effect on VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Wound healing assay, chamber directional migration assay and tube formation assay indicated that anlotinib inhibited VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced cell migration and formation of capillary-like tubes in endothelial cells. Furthermore, anlotinib suppressed blood vessels sprout and microvessel density in rat aortic ring assay and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Importantly, according to our study, the anti-angiogenic effect of anlotinib is superior to sunitinib, sorafenib and nintedanib, which are three main anti-angiogenesis drugs in clinic. Mechanistically, anlotinib inhibits the activation of VEGFR2, PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR1 as well their common downstream ERK signaling.

Patients (n = 440) were randomly assigned in a 2-to-1 ratio to receive either 12 mg/d of anlotinib or a matched placebo. All cases were treated with study drugs at least once in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. The primary end point was overall survival.

Terminal half-life of anlotinib in dogs (22.8\u00b111.0 h) was longer than that in rats (5.1\u00b11.6 h).

To determine the contribution of IbpA and Fic to resistance to host defenses, <i>H. somni</i> strains and mutants that lacked all or a region of <i>ibpA</i> (including the DR1/DR2 regions) were tested for survival in bovine monocytic cells and for serum susceptibility. An <i>H. somni</i> mutant lacking IbpA, but not the DR1/DR2 region within <i>ibpA</i>, was more susceptible to killing by antiserum than the parent, indicating that the entire protein was associated with serum resistance. <i>H. somni</i> strains expressing IbpA replicated in bovine monocytes for at least 72 h and were toxic for these cells.

The ability of Mtb to arrest its delivery to the lysosome can be demonstrated by the prolonged co-localization of bacteria containing phagosomes/vacuole with early phagosomal markers [such as, Ras-related proteins in the brain 5 (Rab5) and Transferrin receptor (TfR)], and a failure to acquire late phagosomal and lysosomal markers (such as Rab7 and LAMP1) (Deretic and Fratti, 1999, Mehra <i>et al.</i>, 2013). Here, a protocol is outlined for infection of macrophages with mycobacterial species like pathogenic Mtb, vaccine strain <i>Mycobacterium bovis-</i> bacillus Calmatte- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and rapidly dividing non-pathogenic <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> (Msmeg), followed by indirect-immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize host vacuolar markers.

This results in quantification of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of these host markers directly around the bacteria/bacterial clusters with increased sensitivity relative to when done manually. By manipulating host or pathogen, this assay can be used to evaluate host or bacterial determinants of intracellular trafficking. The basic method can be applied to studying trafficking of other bacteria or particles like beads, although the kinetics of infection and phagosome maturation will depend upon the phagocytic cargo.

Vacuoles containing B. cenocepacia strain J2315, an isolate of the transmissible ET12 clone, recruited Rab5 and synthesized phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, indicating progression to the early phagosomal stage. Despite the fact that the B. cenocepacia-containing vacuoles rarely fused with lysosomes, they could nevertheless acquire the late phagosomal markers CD63 and Rab7. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and use of a probe that detects Rab7-guanosine triphosphate indicated that activation of Rab7 was impaired by B. cenocepacia, accounting at least in part for the inability of the vacuole to merge with lysosomes. The Rab7 defect was not due to excessive cholesterol accumulation and was confined to the infected vacuoles.

SD causes progressive neurodegeneration and changes in white matter in human infants. An animal model of SD has been established, Hexb-deficient (Hexb) mice, which shows abnormalities resembling the severe phenotype found in human infants. Previously, we reported that the activation state of microglia caused astrogliosis in the early stage of Hexb mouse development. To study how the symptoms of SD develop, we explored the difference in gene expression between 4-week-old Hexb and Hexb mouse cerebral cortices by microarray analysis. The data indicated not only the upregulation of immune system-related genes but also the downregulation of myelin-related genes in the 4-week-old Hexb mouse cerebral cortices. To test the correlation between inflammation and dysmyelination, we generated double-knockout mice of Hexb and the Fc receptor \u03b3 gene (Fcr\u03b3), which is a regulator of autoimmune responses. Dysmyelination recovered in these double-knockout mice. The number of oligodendrocyte progenitors, which expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1, did not change in the 2-week-old mouse brain. These results indicate that microglial activation plays an important role in the myelination process, without influencing the number of oligodendrocyte progenitors, in the development of Hexb mice.",

It features catastrophic neurodegeneration and death in early childhood. How the lysosomal accumulation of ganglioside might affect the early development of the nervous system is not understood. Recently, cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have illuminated early developmental events altered by disease processes. To develop an early neurodevelopmental model of Sandhoff disease, we first generated iPS cells from the fibroblasts of an infantile Sandhoff disease patient, then corrected one of the mutant <i>HEXB</i> alleles in those iPS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, thereby creating isogenic controls. Next, we used the parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells and isogenic <i>HEXB</i>-corrected iPS cell clones to generate cerebral organoids that modeled the first trimester of neurodevelopment. The Sandhoff disease organoids, but not the <i>HEXB</i>-corrected organoids, accumulated GM2 ganglioside and exhibited increased size and cellular proliferation compared with the <i>HEXB</i>-corrected organoids. Whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrated that development was impaired in the Sandhoff disease organoids, suggesting that alterations in neuronal differentiation may occur during early development in the GM2 gangliosidoses.",

Defects in lysosomal enzymes that hydrolyze sphingolipids have been relatively well studied. Gaucher disease is caused by the loss of activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide. Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of \u03b2-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine. All three disorders display significant neuropathology, accompanied by neuroinflammation. It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages ('Gaucher cells') have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

SD leads to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. However, there is a lack of established SD biomarkers, while the pathogenesis etiology remains to be elucidated. To identify potential biomarkers and unveil the pathogenic mechanisms, metabolomics analysis with reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was conducted. A total of 177, 112 and 119 metabolites were found to be significantly dysregulated in mouse liver, mouse brain and human hippocampus samples, respectively (p &lt; .05, ID score &gt; 0.5). Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis of the metabolites showed clear separation of metabolomics profiles between normal and diseased individuals. Among these metabolites, dipeptides, amino acids and derivatives were elevated, indicating a robust protein catabolism. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we also found alterations in metabolites associated with neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulphate, key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was significantly elevated, which was also confirmed by biochemical assays. Collectively, these results indicated major shifts of energy utilization and profound metabolic impairments, contributing to the pathogenesis mechanisms of SD. Global metabolomics profiling may provide an innovative tool for better understanding the disease mechanisms, and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers for SD.",

As sequencing throughput increases, the number of variants called by such tools also grows. Often employed manual inspection of such calls is thus becoming a time-consuming procedure. We developed the Variant InsPector and Expert Rating tool (VIPER) to speed up this process by integrating the Integrative Genomics Viewer into a web application.

In patients with HAM-TSP, HTLV-1 infects mainly CCR4+ T cells and induces functional changes, ultimately causing chronic spinal cord inflammation. We evaluated mogamulizumab, a humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody that targets infected cells, in patients with HAM-TSP. In this uncontrolled, phase 1-2a study, we assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of mogamulizumab in patients with glucocorticoid-refractory HAM-TSP. In the phase 1 dose-escalation study, 21 patients received a single infusion of mogamulizumab (at doses of 0.003 mg per kilogram of body weight, 0.01 mg per kilogram, 0.03 mg per kilogram, 0.1 mg per kilogram, or 0.3 mg per kilogram) and were observed for 85 days. Of those patients, 19 continued on to the phase 2a study and received infusions, over a period of 24 weeks, of 0.003 mg per kilogram, 0.01 mg per kilogram, or 0.03 mg per kilogram at 8-week intervals or infusions of 0.1 mg per kilogram or 0.3 mg per kilogram at 12-week intervals. The side effects of mogamulizumab did not limit administration up to the maximum dose (0.3 mg per kilogram). The most frequent side effects were grade 1 or 2 rash (in 48% of the patients) and lymphopenia and leukopenia (each in 33%). The dose-dependent reduction in the proviral load in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (decrease by day 15 of 64.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51.7 to 78.1) and inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid (decrease by day 29 of 37.3% [95% CI, 24.8 to 49.8] in the CXCL10 level and of 21.0% [95% CI, 10.7 to 31.4] in the neopterin level) was maintained with additional infusions throughout the phase 2a study. A reduction in spasticity was noted in 79% of the patients and a decrease in motor disability in 32%. Mogamulizumab decreased the number of HTLV-1-infected cells and the levels of inflammatory markers. Rash was the chief side effect.

Chemotherapy doublets combined with the fully humanized monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, now constitute first-line therapy for women struggling with recurrent/metastatic cervical carcinoma. Regulatory approval for this indication was based on the phase III randomized trial, GOG 240, which demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival when bevacizumab was added to chemotherapy: 17.0 vs 13.3 months; HR 0.71; 98% CI, 0.54-0.95; p = .004. Incorporation of bevacizumab resulted in significant improvements in progression-free survival and response. These benefits were not accompanied by deterioration in quality of life.

We report a case of BSI in a 3-year-old Tunisian girl with a novel mutation of the transglutaminase 1 gene (TGM1). This infant had been born with a collodion membrane encasing her entire body. From the age of three months, brownish scaling was noted on the bathing suit area. Histology showed orthohyperkeratosis with acanthosis of the epidermis. The granular layer was normal, and the superficial dermis was mildly inflammatory, confirming a diagnosis of proliferating ichthyosis. Molecular analysis in the patient and her parents revealed the mutation I304F of TGM1. Treatment with emollients and keratolytics partially improved the patient's skin condition. Bathing suit ichthyosis is an uncommon phenotype unique in its topography, which involves the trunk but spares the face and extremities. Previous studies using molecular analysis have shown that BSI is caused mainly by mutations in TGM1. Twenty missense mutations have been reported in BSI. Of these 20 missense mutations, nine occurred only in patients with the BSI phenotype and 11 were common to BSI and other types of ARCI. Until recently, there has been no genotype-phenotype correlation. Therefore, the same mutation of the transglutaminase 1 could result in either generalized ARCI or BSI. The present case demonstrates this phenotype in a White Tunisian patient with a novel mutation of TGM1 (I304F) not previously reported in BSI.",

Here we report on a series of 10 BSI patients. Our genetic, ultrastructural and biochemical investigations show that BSI is caused by transglutaminase-1 (TGase-1) deficiency. Altogether, we identified 13 mutations in TGM1-among them seven novel missense mutations and one novel nonsense mutation. Structural modeling for the Tyr276Asn mutation reveals that the residue is buried in the hydrophobic interior of the enzyme and that the hydroxyl side chain of Tyr276 is exposed to solvent in a cavity of the enzyme. Cryosections of healthy skin areas demonstrated an almost normal TGase activity, in contrast to the affected BSI skin, which only showed a cytoplasmic and clearly reduced TGase-1 activity. The distribution of TGase-1 substrates in the epidermis of affected skin corresponded to the situation in TGase-1 deficiency. Interestingly, the expression of TGase-3 and cathepsin D was reduced. Digital thermography validated a striking correlation between warmer body areas and presence of scaling in patients suggesting a decisive influence of the skin temperature. In situ TGase testing in skin of BSI patients demonstrated a marked decrease of enzyme activity when the temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees C.

Three probands were homozygous for Arg264Trp, Arg286Gln, or Arg315Leu, indicating that these mutations are temperature sensitive. Seven of 10 probands with a compound heterozygous TGM1 genotype had a mutation at either arginine 307 or 315, providing evidence that mutations at these sites are temperature sensitive and highlighting the importance of these residues in the pathogenesis of BSI. Our findings expand the genotypic spectrum of BSI and the understanding of temperature sensitivity of TGM1 mutations.

Adverse events occurred in 101 (67%) of 150 patients in the robotic cystectomy group and 105 (69%) of 152 patients in the open cystectomy group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (53 [35%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 39 [26%] in the open cystectomy group) and postoperative ileus (33 [22%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 31 [20%] in the open cystectomy group). In patients with bladder cancer, robotic cystectomy was non-inferior to open cystectomy for 2-year progression-free survival. Increased adoption of robotic surgery in clinical practice should lead to future randomised trials to assess the true value of this surgical approach in patients with other cancer types.

However, robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is becoming the preferred surgical approach in many centres as it seems to maintain the oncological control of open surgery whilst offering improved perioperative benefits. A review of the literature was conducted using the Pubmed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge and Cochrane Databases to identify studies that included both ORC and RARC with intracorporeal and extracorporeal urinary diversion (UD) published up to July 2017. Evidence from four single-centre randomised controlled trials and now the multicentre Randomized Trial of Open versus Robotic Cystectomy (RAZOR) trial demonstrate the oncological equivalence of RARC to ORC. The only convincing evidence for the superiority of RARC is in the area of blood loss and transfusion rates. However, the UD procedure in these trials was performed extracorporeally and, to realise the full benefits of RARC, a totally intracorporeal approach is needed. Intracorporeal UDs (ICUDs) have been shown to be technically feasible by a few expert centres and have demonstrated some improved short-term perioperative outcomes compared to extracorporeal UDs. Although initial outcomes appear promising, RARC with ICUD is far from gaining 'gold standard' status. Further studies are needed to confirm that outcomes are reproducible widely. Furthermore, the benefits of a totally intracorporeal approach must be confirmed in randomised controlled trials.",

Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability. To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5 times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes. In addition to known enrichments in segmental duplication and near centromeres and telomeres, we also report that CNVs are enriched in specific types of satellite and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Finally, using this comprehensive approach, we identify 3455 regions with recurrent CNVs that were missing from existing catalogs. In particular, we identify 347 genes with a novel exonic CNV in low-mappability regions, including 29 genes previously associated with disease.",

We review novel biologic agents targeting the T-helper 17 axis, including therapies directed towards interleukin (IL)-17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab), IL-17R (brodalumab), IL-12/23p40 (ustekinumab, briakinumab) and IL-23p19 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, brazikumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab). We also present an overview of biologics active against type I and II interferons, including sifalumumab, rontalizumab, anifrolumab and fontolizumab. Emerging strategies to interfere with cellular adhesion processes involved in lymphocyte recruitment are discussed, including both integrin blockade (natalizumab, vedolizumab, etrolizumab) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor inhibition (fingolimod, ozanimod). We summarise the development and recent application of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in the treatment of IMIDs, including first-generation pan-JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, peficitinib) and second-generation selective JAK inhibitors (decernotinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib).

Upadacitinib plasma concentrations (n = 6399) from 107 healthy subjects and 466 RA patients from three phase I and two 12-week RA phase IIb trials (1-48 mg immediate-release doses across studies) were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling.

Estimates (95% bootstrap confidence interval) for upadacitinib oral clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, absorption lag time, and mean absorption time were 39.7 (37.8-41.5) L/h, 210 (196-231) L, 0.48 (0.47-0.49) h, and 0.08 (0.04-0.12) h, respectively, for a typical healthy male. Matching on other covariates, a 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated for females relative to males, and for subjects with RA relative to healthy volunteers, respectively. Subjects with RA with mild or moderate renal impairment were estimated to have 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib AUC, respectively, compared with subjects with RA with normal renal function.

The analytical variability in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and artifacts in coverage data because of issues with mappability along with lack of robust bioinformatics tools for CNV detection have limited the utility of targeted NGS data to identify CNVs. We describe the development and implementation of a bioinformatics algorithm, copy number variation-random forest (CNV-RF), that incorporates a machine learning component to identify CNVs from targeted NGS data. Using CNV-RF, we identified 12 of 13 deletions in samples with known CNVs, two cases with duplications, and identified novel deletions in 22 additional cases. Furthermore, no CNVs were identified among 60 genes in 14 cases with normal copy number and no CNVs were identified in another 104 patients with clinical suspicion of CNVs. All positive deletions and duplications were confirmed using a quantitative PCR method. CNV-RF also detected heterozygous deletions and duplications with a specificity of 50% across 4813 genes. The ability of CNV-RF to detect clinically relevant CNVs with a high degree of sensitivity along with confirmation using a low-cost quantitative PCR method provides a framework for providing comprehensive NGS-based CNV/single-nucleotide variant detection in a clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory.",

Those recommendations remain valid for MSM, including MSM who also have sex with women. Since January 2011, data from studies of PrEP among heterosexual men and women have become available, and on July 16, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a label indication for reduction of risk for sexual acquisition of HIV infection among adults, including both heterosexuals and MSM.

We previously showed that a coitally-dependent Truvada regimen protected macaques against rectal SHIV transmission. Here we examined FTC and tenofovir TFV exposure in vaginal tissues after oral dosing and assessed if peri-coital Truvada also protects macaques against vaginal SHIV infection. The pharmacokinetic profile of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) was evaluated at first dose. FTC and TFV levels were measured in blood plasma, rectal, and vaginal secretions. Intracellular concentrations of FTC-triphosphate (FTC-TP) and TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) were measured in PBMCs, rectal tissues, and vaginal tissues. Efficacy of Truvada in preventing vaginal SHIV infection was assessed using a repeat-exposure vaginal SHIV transmission model consisting of weekly exposures to low doses of SHIV162p3. Six pigtail macaques with normal menstrual cycles received Truvada 24 h before and 2 h after each weekly virus exposure and six received placebo. Infection was monitored by serology and PCR amplification of SHIV RNA and DNA. As in humans, the concentration of FTC was higher than the concentration of TFV in vaginal secretions. Also as in humans, TFV levels in vaginal secretions were lower than in rectal secretions. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations were also lower in vaginal tissues than in rectal tissues. Despite the low vaginal TFV exposure, all six treated macaques were protected from infection after 18 exposures or 4 full menstrual cycles. In contrast, all 6 control animals were infected. We modeled a peri-coital regimen with two doses of Truvada and showed that it fully protected macaques from repeated SHIV exposures. Our results open the possibility for simplified PrEP regimens to prevent vaginal HIV transmission in women.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19731560": "Chronic hepatitis B affects 5-10% of HIV patients in Western countries. Lamivudine should no longer be used as a single anti-HBV agent in HIV-HBV co-infected patients, given its limited antiviral potency and high risk of selection of resistance, which further results in wide cross-resistance to all other nucleoside analogues. Recent reports of transmission of lamivudine-resistant HBV in HIV patients are of especial concern, and large surveillance studies suggest that it may occur in up to 10% of new HBV infections in Western countries. Another worrisome aspect of the selection of lamivudine-resistant HBV is the potential for selection of vaccine escape mutants. Currently, tenofovir must be viewed as the drug of choice in HIV-HBV co-infected patients in whom antiretroviral therapy is advised. Its co-formulation with emtricitabine (Truvada) is particularly convenient for treating both HIV and HBV in co-infected individuals. While pegIFN-alpha monotherapy for 1 year may be considered for HIV-HBV coinfected individuals with good spontaneous HIV control (elevated CD4 cell count, low plasma HIV-RNA), and certain HBV features (genotype A, HBeAg+, low serum HBV-DNA and elevated ALT), it is clear that very few coinfected patients fulfill these criteria. In HBeAg-negative HIV patients, adefovir may be an option but the relatively low antiviral potency of this drug discourages its wide use. Given its potential anti-HIV activity, both entecavir and telbivudine must only be prescribed with antiretroviral agents. Lack of information about potential pharmacodynamic interactions between entecavir and abacavir (both are guanosine analogues) or between telbivudine and zidovudine or stavudine (all are thymidine analogues) further discourages their concomitant use. At this time, most experts agree that early introduction of anti-HBV active HAART is the best strategy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HIV patients, and Truvada must be part of the triple regimen.",

One of the 'five pillars' to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. Despite its advantages, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to the once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, many next-generation regimen, including long-acting formulations, are currently investigated. However, pre-clinical testing may not guide candidate selection, since it often fails to translate into clinical efficacy. On the other hand, quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic and requires to conduct long (years) and large (N&gt;1000 individuals) trials, precluding systematic evaluation of candidates and deployment strategies. To prioritize- and help design PrEP regimen, tools are urgently needed that integrate pharmacological-, viral- and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. Integrating the aforementioned factors, we developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). Combining the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, we predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50- and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP 'on demand' and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure. Once daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP 'on demand' prevented 79-84% infections and PEP &gt;80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. While the simulation framework can easily be adapted to other PrEP candidates, our simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. Moreover, the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations.",

Because Truvada can suppress hepatitis B virus replication, and withdrawal of Truvada can cause hepatic flares in patients with chronic hepatitis B, pre-enrollment screening included serological screening for hepatitis B virus markers. Women with chronic infections were not enrolled in the trial. Women found to be unprotected against hepatitis B were enrolled and offered three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Reinfection and reactivation of previously resolved hepatitis B virus infections have been documented in immunosuppressed individuals but not in healthy individuals. We present the case of a participant enrolled in the FEM-PrEP clinical trial with baseline evidence of immunity against hepatitis B virus who subsequently developed acute hepatitis B. A 21-year-old Black non-pregnant woman was enrolled in the FEM-PrEP trial. She was human immunodeficiency virus-negative and a serological test for hepatitis B virus was negative. She had evidence of low levels of protection against hepatitis B virus and normal liver function. She had no hepatitis B vaccination history, thus it was concluded that she had post-infection immunity. At week 36 she presented with severely elevated liver enzyme levels that, upon further investigation, were a result of acute hepatitis B virus infection. The infection followed an asymptomatic course until full recovery of her liver enzymes a few weeks later. At study unblinding, the participant was found to be on the Truvada arm. Retrospective plasma drug level testing found low levels of study drugs from week 4. The participant remained human immunodeficiency virus-negative throughout the study. Hepatitis B virus infection reactivation or reinfection is a rare phenomenon in healthy individuals. However, reactivations have been reported in patients being treated for chronic hepatitis B with the drugs contained in Truvada, after treatment had been withdrawn. This participant may have reactivated after stopping Truvada, or she may have reactivated spontaneously owing to relatively low levels of protective antibodies against hepatitis B. Alternatively, she may have been reinfected. Clinicians should be aware that hepatitis B virus reactivation or reinfection may cause elevated transaminases even in the presence of low baseline immunity.",

As part of a larger study, we conducted 60 qualitative interviews with women at higher risk of HIV in Bondo, Kenya, and Pretoria, South Africa. Participants charted their sexual contacts over the previous six months, indicated whether they would have taken PrEP if available and discussed whether and why they would have suspended PrEP use. Nearly all participants said they would have used PrEP in the previous six months; half indicated they would have suspended PrEP use at some point. Participants' reasons for an extended break from PrEP were related to partnership dynamics (e.g., perceived low risk of a stable partner) and phases of life (e.g., trying to conceive). Life events (e.g., holidays and travel) could prompt shorter breaks in PrEP use. These circumstances may or may not correspond to actual contexts of lower risk, highlighting the importance of tailored PrEP risk-reduction counselling.",

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS, or ERIS) is an exciting adjuvant target due to its role in cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-driven anti-viral immunity; however, a major hindrance is STING's cytosolic localization which requires intracellular delivery of its agonists. As a result, STING agonists administered in a soluble form have elicited suboptimal immune responses. Delivery of STING agonists via particle platforms has proven a more successful strategy, but the opportunity for improved formulations and bioactivity remains. In this study we evaluated the adjuvant activity of the potent STING agonist, CDN 3'3'-cGAMP (cGAMP), encapsulated in acid-sensitive acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) polymeric microparticles (MPs) which passively target antigen-presenting cells for intracellular release. This formulation was superior to all particle delivery systems evaluated and maintained its bioactivity following a sterilizing dose of gamma irradiation. Compared to soluble cGAMP, the Ace-DEX cGAMP MPs enhanced type-I interferon responses nearly 1000-fold in vitro and 50-fold in vivo, caused up to a 10<sup>4</sup>-fold boost in antibody titers, increased Th1-associated responses, and expanded germinal center B cells and memory T cells. Furthermore, the encapsulated cGAMP elicited no observable toxicity in animals and achieved protective immunity against a lethal influenza challenge seven months post-immunization when using CDN adjuvant doses up to 100-fold lower than previous reports. For these reasons, Ace-DEX MP-encapsulated cGAMP represents a potent vaccine adjuvant of humoral and cellular immunity.",

Activation of innate immune responses and excessive production of type I interferons (IFNs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Recognition of nucleic acids by cytosolic nucleic acid sensors is a major trigger for the induction of type I IFNs. Upon activation, cytosolic DNA sensors can interact with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, and activation of STING causes increased expression of type I IFNs. The role of STING activation in SS is not known. In this study, to investigate whether the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway influences SS development, female C57BL/6 mice were injected with a STING agonist, dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). Salivary glands (SGs) were studied for gene expression and inflammatory cell infiltration. SG function was evaluated by measuring pilocarpine-induced salivation. Sera were analyzed for cytokines and autoantibodies. Primary SG cells were used to study the expression and activation of STING. Our data show that systemic DMXAA treatment rapidly induced the expression of Ifnb1, Il6, and Tnfa in the SGs, and these cytokines were also elevated in circulation. In contrast, increased Ifng gene expression was dominantly detected in the SGs. The type I innate lymphoid cells present within the SGs were the major source of IFN-\u03b3, and their numbers increased significantly within 3 d of treatment. STING expression in SGs was mainly observed in ductal and interstitial cells. In primary SG cells, DMXAA activated STING and induced IFN-\u03b2 production. The DMXAA-treated mice developed autoantibodies, sialoadenitis, and glandular hypofunction. Our study demonstrates that activation of the STING pathway holds the potential to initiate SS. Thus, apart from viral infections, conditions that cause cellular perturbations and accumulation of host DNA within the cytosol should also be considered as possible triggers for SS.",

However, the specific immune mechanisms underlying these responses remain incompletely defined. The majority of these studies have focused on the effect of CDNs on immune cells but have not conclusively interrogated the role of stromal cells in the acute rejection of the CDN-injected tumor.

A new avenue of immunotherapy utilizing novel strategy to block immune checkpoints has emerged in a new era for RCC treatment (Ascierto et al. in J Transl Med 12:291, 2014). Results from clinical trials are encouraging in both front-line and second-line settings, in a phase III trial (CheckMate 025) nivolumab compared to everolimus improved overall survival in previously treated metastatic RCC who had progressed on prior treatment with targeting agents (Motzer et al. in N Engl J Med 373:1803, 2015). CheckMate 214, a phase III trial, demonstrated superior overall survival and objective response with combined checkpoint inhibitors compared to sunitinib in Treatment-Na\u00efve Advanced RCC among intermediate- and poor-risk group (Motzer et al. in N Engl J Med. 378(14):1277-1290, 2018). In this review, we discuss the systemic Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors that have been approved or are currently being investigated in RCC, clinical experience with these agents, and its future development.",

First-in-class, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab improved overall survival in advanced renal cell carcinoma following prior anti-angiogenic therapy, an important shift in the management of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Further improvements of long-term outcomes will be driven by combinations in the first-line setting, including PD-1/PD-L1 associated with antiangiogenic therapies, or PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors with other immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CTLA-4, anti-LAG-3 or TIM-3 targeted therapies. The first two randomized Phase 3 trials assessing these combinations have now challenged sunitinib in first-line setting. First, the CheckMate 214 trial demonstrated an objective response rate and overall survival benefit for the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the intermediate- and poor-risk patients. Second, the IMMotion 151 study demonstrated a progression-free survival benefit for the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination by investigator assessment. Further Phase 3 trials are awaited with tyrosine kinase and immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations. Clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors are also actively investigated in the localized adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. Nevertheless, the search for biomarkers along with new clinical trial designs will be crucial to better select the patients that may derive the greatest benefit from these advances. The continuing improvement of antitumor immunity comprehension and the emergence of new immune modulatory treatments will deeply change the management of renal cell carcinoma for the years to come.",

For this reason the European Association of Urology RCC guidelines have been updated. PATIENT SUMMARY: The European Association of Urology guidelines will be updated based on the results of the phase III Checkmate-214 clinical trial. The trial showed superior survival for a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (IN), compared with the previous standard of care, in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. When IN is not safe or feasible, alternative agents such as sunitinib, pazopanib, and cabozantinib should be considered. Furthermore, at present, the data from the trial are immature in favourable-risk patients. Therefore, sunitinib or pazopanib remains the favoured agent for this subgroup of patients.",

In particular, the RNA sequencing gene expression experimental technique stands out for case-control studies on cancer, which can be addressed with supervised machine learning techniques able to extract human interpretable models composed of genes, and their relation to the investigated disease. State of the art rule-based classifiers are designed to extract a single classification model, possibly composed of few relevant genes. Conversely, we aim to create a large knowledge base composed of many rule-based models, and thus determine which genes could be potentially involved in the analyzed tumor. This comprehensive and open access knowledge base is required to disseminate novel insights about cancer. We propose CamurWeb, a new method and web-based software that is able to extract multiple and equivalent classification models in form of logic formulas (\"if then\" rules) and to create a knowledge base of these rules that can be queried and analyzed. The method is based on an iterative classification procedure and an adaptive feature elimination technique that enables the computation of many rule-based models related to the cancer under study. Additionally, CamurWeb includes a user friendly interface for running the software, querying the results, and managing the performed experiments. The user can create her profile, upload her gene expression data, run the classification analyses, and interpret the results with predefined queries. In order to validate the software we apply it to all public available RNA sequencing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas database obtaining a large open access knowledge base about cancer. CamurWeb is available at http://bioinformatics.iasi.cnr.it/camurweb . The experiments prove the validity of CamurWeb, obtaining many classification models and thus several genes that are associated to 21 different cancer types. Finally, the comprehensive knowledge base about cancer and the software tool are released online; interested researchers have free access to them for further studies and to design biological experiments in cancer research.",

In combination with high-throughput sequencing, CAGE has revolutionized our understanding of the rules of transcription initiation, led to discovery of new core promoter sequence features, and discovered transcription initiation at enhancers genome-wide. The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 \u00b5g), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA.

We established an innovative service offering plasma tenofovir (TFV) and emcitrabine (FTC) therapeutic drug monitoring for people buying generic PrEP online, to ensure that drug concentrations in vivo were consistent with those of propriety brands and previously published data. TFV/FTC concentrations were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection. Evaluation of renal function and testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were also carried out, at baseline and every 3-6 months, with risk reduction advice. A total of 293 individuals presented having purchased PrEP on the internet: 85% were white, 84% were taking daily PrEP, and 16% were event-driven. Most were on generic TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC from Cipla Ltd. Median (range) TFV and FTC plasma concentrations were 104 (21-597) ng/mL and 140 (17-1876) ng/mL, respectively. All concentrations were above our established plasma TFV and FTC targets, based on previously published data. Renal function was normal in all evaluable individuals and no new cases of HIV, HBV or HCV infection were seen. In a population at high risk of HIV acquisition, who cannot yet access PrEP on the NHS, concentrations of TFV and FTC in generic formulations purchased over the internet were similar to (or slightly higher than) those measured in phase I studies with the original formulation from Gilead (Truvada\u2122), which has demonstrated high levels of protection against HIV infection in previous PrEP clinical trials.",

Although TDF is well tolerated, the potential for kidney and bone toxicity has important implications for public health given the large number of individuals exposed to TDF worldwide. This review summarizes the recent literature on kidney and bone health in individuals treated with TDF and the newer prodrug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). Risk factors for TDF toxicity appear to be similar in patients treated for HIV or hepatitis B virus and in HIV-uninfected PrEP users, although drug-drug interactions are a more important concern in HIV-positive individuals. The risk of toxicity appears to be lower with TAF, but further studies are needed to confirm the safety of long-term use and to evaluate the efficacy of TAF-based PrEP.

In this review, we focus on the challenges and opportunities of a daily oral PrEP regimen to curb the rising incidence of HIV infection in high-risk groups, and particularly in men who have sex with men. A number of issues would need to be addressed before PrEP could be implemented, including assessing the real effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of daily PrEP, the sustainability of daily adherence, the risk of selecting resistance, the long-term safety, and the risk of change in sexual behavior that might offset the benefit of PrEP.

To prepare these guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of values and preferences among populations that might benefit from PrEP, women, heterosexual men, young women and adolescent girls, female sex workers, serodiscordant couples, transgender people and people who inject drugs, and among healthcare providers who may prescribe PrEP. A comprehensive search strategy reviewed three electronic databases of articles and HIV-related conference abstracts (January 1990-April 2015). Data abstraction used standardised forms to categorise by population groups and relevant themes. Of 3068 citations screened, 76 peer-reviewed articles and 28 conference abstracts were included. Geographic coverage was global. Most studies (N = 78) evaluated hypothetical use of PrEP, while 26 studies included individuals who actually took PrEP or placebo. Awareness of PrEP was low, but once participants were presented with information about PrEP, the majority said they would consider using it. Concerns about safety, side effects, cost and effectiveness were the most frequently cited barriers to use. There was little indication of risk compensation. Healthcare providers would consider prescribing PrEP, but need more information before doing so. Findings from a rapidly expanding evidence base suggest that the majority of populations most likely to benefit from PrEP feel positively towards it.

The scale-up of PrEP is underway, but several implementation questions remain unanswered. Demonstration projects and open-label extensions of placebo-controlled trials are ongoing and hope to contribute to our understanding of PrEP use and delivery outside the randomized controlled trial setting. Evidence is beginning to emerge from these open-label studies and will be critical for guiding PrEP scale-up. Outside of such studies, PrEP uptake has been slow and several client- and provider-related barriers are limiting uptake. Maximizing the public health impact of PrEP will require rollout to be combined with interventions to promote uptake, support adherence, and prevent increases in risk behavior.

ART alone initiated at a CD4 lymphocyte cell count &lt;200 cells/\u00b5L (80% coverage and 96% effectiveness) prevents 20% of HIV infections over 10 years but increases drug resistance prevalence to 6.6%. PrEP alone (30% coverage and 75% effectiveness) also prevents 21% of infections but with lower resistance prevalence of 0.5%. The ratio of cumulative infections prevented to prevalent drug-resistant cases after 10 years is 7-fold higher for PrEP than for ART. Combined ART + PrEP with overlapping ARVs prevents 35% of infections but increases resistance prevalence to 8.2%, whereas ART + PrEP with nonoverlapping ARVs prevents slightly more infections (37%) and reduces resistance prevalence to 7.2%. Combined ART + PrEP is likely to prevent more HIV infections than either strategy alone, but with higher prevalence of drug resistance. ART is predicted to contribute more to resistance than is PrEP.

The most commonly used PrEP medication (Truvada<sup>\u00ae</sup> , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV NAT. Failure to seroconvert and seroreversion (loss of previously detectable HIV antibodies) have also both been observed with 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation screening immunoassays, as well as Western blot assays. If such a person was tested in the course of donating blood, the results may therefore be difficult to interpret. The index of suspicion for possible PrEP 'interference' should be highest in the context of concomitant low-level positive or 'greyzone' reactivity on HIV NAT and serological tests, which is an unusual pattern in acutely HIV-infected blood donors. Another possibility is detectable HIV RNA with negative HIV serology (i.e. a potential 'NAT yield' case) but without subsequent HIV seroconversion (or disappearance of HIV RNA). Excluding antiretroviral therapy or PrEP use by the donor in such circumstances would be important. The current rarity of PrEP breakthrough infection indicates that any potential safety risk is likely very small.

Chronic hypophosphatemia causes impaired mineralization of the bone matrix and results in rickets and osteomalacia. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphate metabolism. FGF23 excess induces hypophosphatemia via impaired phosphate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules and decreased phosphate absorption in the intestines. There are several types of genetic and acquired FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. Among these diseases, X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, is the most prevalent form of genetic FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. Another clinically relevant form of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic disease is tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with FGF23-producing tumors. A combination of active vitamin D and phosphate salts is the current medical therapy used to treat patients with XLH and inoperative TIO. However, this therapy has certain efficacy- and safety-associated limitations. Several measures to inhibit FGF23 activity have been considered as possible new treatments for FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. In particular, a humanized monoclonal antibody for FGF23 (burosumab) is a promising treatment in patients with XLH and TIO.

We investigated burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia. In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events. The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to 1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons); these improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to 2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter).

Although the exact molecular mechanisms by which PHEX mutations cause disturbed phosphate handling in XLH remain unknown, focus for novel therapies has more recently been based upon the finding that the bone-produced phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor-23 is elevated in XLH patient plasma. Previous treatment strategies for XLH were based upon phosphate repletion plus active vitamin D analogues, which are difficult to manage, fail to address the primary pathogenesis of the disease, and can have deleterious side effects. A novel therapy for XLH directly targeting fibroblast growth factor-23 via a humanized monoclonal antibody (burosumab-twza/CRYSVITA, henceforth referred to just as burosumab) has emerged as an effective, and recently approved, pharmacological treatment for both children and adults. This review will provide an overview of the clinical manifestations of XLH, the molecular pathophysiology, and summarize its current treatment.",

It directly addresses the excessive FGF23 activity in patients with XLH by binding to FGF23, and inhibiting its signaling. This leads to increased gastrointestinal phosphate absorption and renal phosphate reabsorption, thereby improving serum phosphate levels, and, ultimately, bone mineralization and the risk of bone disease. In clinical trials, subcutaneous burosumab increased serum phosphorus levels in pediatric and adult patients with XLH, as well as significantly improving the severity of rickets in children, and improving pain, stiffness, physical functioning, and fracture/pseudofracture healing in adults. Burosumab is well tolerated by children and adults with XLH, with most treatment-emergent adverse events being of mild to moderate severity.",

A combination of oral active vitamin D3 and phosphate salt is the current standard therapy for patients with FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia. However, these medications may cause long-term complications, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism and chronic kidney disease. Therefore, an anti-FGF23 neutralizing antibody that blocks FGF23 activity has been produced. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets(XLHR)is the most prevalent form of hereditary FGF23-related hypophosphatemia. The safety and efficacy of a human anti-FGF23 antibody, KRN23 or burosumab, has been confirmed in adults and children with XLHR. Moreover, Burosumab is being tested as a potential treatment for patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia(TIO), which is the most prevalent form of acquired FGF23-related hypophosphatemia.",

We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort. In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n = 846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor \u03baB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants. This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n = 390) in the cohort. Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data. Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants. Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses. Both sporadic and familial cases demonstrated evidence of the noninfective complications of CVID, including massive lymphadenopathy (24%), unexplained splenomegaly (48%), and autoimmune disease (48%), features prior studies correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Although partial penetrance of clinical symptoms was noted in certain pedigrees, all carriers have a deficiency in B-lymphocyte differentiation. Detailed assessment of B-lymphocyte numbers, phenotype, and function identifies the presence of an increased CD21<sup>low</sup> B-cell population. Combined with identification of the disease-causing variant, this distinguishes between healthy subjects, asymptomatic carriers, and clinically affected cases. We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30063981": "Monoallelic loss-of-function mutations in NFKB1 were recently recognized as the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The prototypic clinical phenotype of NFKB1-deficient patients includes common CVID features, such as hypogammaglobulinaemia and sinopulmonary infections, plus other highly variable individual manifestations. Here, we describe a patient with a profound CVID phenotype and severe gastrointestinal manifestations, including chronic and recurrent diarrhoea. Using an NGS customized panel of 323 genes related to primary immunodeficiencies, we identified a novel monoallelic loss-of-function mutation in NFKB1 leading to a truncated protein (c.1149delT/p.Gly384Glu \u2217 48). Interestingly, we also found a rare variant in NOD2 previously associated with Crohn's disease (p.His352Arg). Our patient had hypogammaglobulinaemia with a small number of B cells, most of which were na\u00efve. The most noteworthy findings included marked skewing towards a Th1 phenotype in peripheral blood T cells and excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1). The patient's 6-year-old daughter, a carrier of the NFKB1 mutation, is clinically asymptomatic, but has started to show cellular and molecular changes. This case of NFKB1 deficiency appears to be a combination of immunodeficiency and a hyperinflammatory state. The current situation of the patient's daughter provides a glimpse of the preclinical phase of the condition.",

Available antivirals target the viral polymerase but are subject to cross-resistance and toxicity. New antivirals targeting other replication steps and inducing fewer adverse effects are therefore needed. During HCMV replication, DNA maturation and packaging are performed by the terminase complex, which cleaves DNA to package the genome into the capsid. Identified in herpesviruses and bacteriophages, and with no counterpart in mammalian cells, these terminase proteins are ideal targets for highly specific antivirals. A new terminase inhibitor, letermovir, recently proved effective against HCMV in phase III clinical trials, but the mechanism of action is unclear. Letermovir has no significant activity against other herpesvirus or non-human CMV. This review focuses on the highly conserved mechanism of HCMV DNA-packaging and the potential of the terminase complex to serve as an antiviral target. We describe the intrinsic mechanism of DNA-packaging, highlighting the structure-function relationship of HCMV terminase complex components.",

Posaconazole (POS), a substrate of glucuronosyltransferase and P-glycoprotein, and voriconazole (VRC), a substrate of CYP2C9/19, are commonly administered to transplant recipients. Because coadministration of these azoles with letermovir is expected, the effect of letermovir on exposure to these antifungals was investigated. Two trials were conducted in healthy female subjects 18 to 55 years of age. In trial 1, single-dose POS 300 mg was administered alone, followed by a 7-day washout; then letermovir 480 mg once daily was given for 14 days with POS 300 mg coadministered on day 14. In trial 2, on day 1 VRC 400 mg was given every 12 hours; on days 2 and 3, VRC 200 mg was given every 12 hours, and on day 4 VRC 200 mg. On days 5 to 8, letermovir 480 mg was given once daily. Days 9 to 12 repeated days 1 to 4 coadministered with letermovir 480 mg once daily. In both trials, blood samples were collected for the assessment of the pharmacokinetic profiles of the antifungals, and safety was assessed. The geometric mean ratios (90%CIs) for POS+letermovir/POS area under the curve and peak concentration were 0.98 (0.83, 1.17) and 1.11 (0.95, 1.29), respectively. Voriconazole+letermovir/VRC area under the curve and peak concentration geometric mean ratios were 0.56 (0.51, 0.62) and 0.61 (0.53, 0.71), respectively. All treatments were generally well tolerated.

CMV surveillance-preemptive therapy is the current preferred approach for preventing CMV disease after HSCT. In contrast, antiviral prophylaxis is not commonly used due to myelosuppressive effects of valganciclovir. In this article, the role of the newly approved antiviral compound, letermovir, is reviewed. Letermovir inhibits CMV by interfering viral terminase complex. In a phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical study that enrolled 495 CMV-seropositive HSCT recipients, the primary end point of clinically significant CMV infection was significantly reduced by letermovir prophylaxis. Letermovir was well tolerated without risk of myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Experimental in-vitro data suggest that letermovir may possess low genetic barrier to resistance. In prophylaxis trials, two breakthrough infections were reported due to selection of CMV UL56 V236M mutation. Letermovir is an important addition to the current strategies for CMV prevention after allogeneic HSCT. Its favourable efficacy and safety profile re-opens door for antiviral prophylaxis another first-line option, similar to CMV surveillance-preemptive therapy, for preventing CMV in allogeneic HSCT recipients.",

In further studies of emerging drug resistance, a baseline laboratory CMV strain was serially propagated in cell culture under a combination of letermovir and ganciclovir. In eight experiments, UL56 terminase gene mutations were detected beginning at 10 passages and included novel amino acid substitutions V236A, L328V, and A365S in a region previously associated with letermovir resistance. Outside this region, the UL56 substitution C25F was detected at moderate drug concentrations in two experiments as either the first detected mutation or an addition to a preexisting V231L substitution. In all cases, mutation at UL56 codon 325 conferring absolute letermovir resistance eventually developed at a median of 20 passages. No UL97 kinase or UL54 DNA polymerase mutations relevant to ganciclovir resistance were detected until many passages after the first detection of the UL56 mutations. UL56 substitutions V236A, L328V, and A365S were shown to confer borderline or low-grade letermovir resistance, while C25F conferred a 5.4-fold increase in letermovir resistance (50% effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>]) by itself and a 46-fold increase in combination with V231L. The evolution of resistance mutations sooner in UL56 than in UL54 or UL97 is consistent with prior <i>in vitro</i> observations, and UL56 codon 25 is a genetic locus for letermovir resistance distinct from loci previously described.",

It was a cross-sectional and included 114 patients with idiopathic achalasia and 114 age-matched and sex-matched control patients with GERD. Data on the presence of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the time of presentation, and any family history of autoimmune disease were obtained from the hospital's medical records.

Achalasia is generally accepted as a multifactorial disorder with various genetic and environmental factors being risk-associated. Since genetic factors predisposing to achalasia have been poorly documented, we assessed whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes mediating immune response and neuronal function contribute to achalasia susceptibility. 391 SNPs covering 190 immune and 67 neuronal genes were genotyped in an exploratory cohort from Central Europe (589 achalasia patients, 794 healthy volunteers (HVs)). 24 SNPs (p&lt;0.05) were validated in an Italian (160 achalasia patients, 278 HVs) and Spanish cohort (281 achalasia patients, 296 HVs). 16 SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1799724 (r(2)&gt;0.2) were genotyped in the exploratory cohort. Genotype distributions of patients (1030) and HVs (1368) were compared using Cochran-Armitage trend test. The rs1799724 SNP located between the lymphotoxin-\u03b1 (LTA) and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) genes was significantly associated with achalasia and withstood correction for testing multiple SNPs (p=1.17E-4, OR=1.41 (1.18 to 1.67)). SNPs in high LD with rs1799724 were associated with achalasia. Three SNPs located in myosin-5B, adrenergic receptor-\u03b2-2 and interleukin-13 (IL13) showed nominally significant association to achalasia that was strengthened by replication. Our study provides evidence for rs1799724 at the LTA/TNF\u03b1 locus as a susceptibility factor for idiopathic achalasia.

Retrospective review of 73 MII-EM tracings from patients with achalasia done in our laboratory between October 2001 and December 2004 (38 females; mean age=53.5 y). Patients with previous esophageal interventions were excluded. Manometric and MII characteristics were identified and compared during 10 liquid and 10 viscous swallows. Patients were also divided into 2 groups: vigorous achalasia (VA) and achalasia. Twenty-two of the seventy-one (31%) achalasia patients had a hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) for the 71 patients with achalasia was 37.9+/-21.2 mm Hg compared with 27.3+/-9.3 mm Hg (P&lt;0.05) in the 73 patients with normal motility. The mean LESP in patients with achalasia was 36+/-20.3 mm Hg compared with 47+/-23.2 mm Hg (P&lt;0.05) in patients with VA. Elevated intraesophageal pressure (IEP) was noted in 45/73 (61.6%).

The loss of inhibitory neurons in the distal esophagus, as well as abnormalities in the vagus nerve, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, and autonomic nervous system, have been described in achalasia. Although the underlying cause of idiopathic achalasia is unknown, the diffuse neuronal effects found suggest a possible viral or neurodegenerative mechanism. By use of serological methods, a significant association between the HLA-DQ1 phenotype and idiopathic achalasia has been found, suggesting a possible immunogenetic mechanism. To further define immunogenetics in the pathogenesis of idiopathic achalasia, we performed tissue typing in patients with achalasia to determine their specific HLA phenotypes. We prospectively studied 32 patients (23 white and 9 black) with idiopathic achalasia. Peripheral blood was collected, and HLA-DR and -DQ typing by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers was performed. Results were compared with those from 268 racially matched local controls. Idiopathic achalasia and the broad HLA-DQ1 allele were not significantly associated in either population, although a trend was found in white subjects (odds ratio [OR], 2.16; chi2 = 5.36, P corrected [Pc] = 0.0824). Further subtyping in white subjects revealed a significant association between idiopathic achalasia and the DQB1*0602 allele (OR, 3.10; chi2 = 7.32, Pc = 0.0408).

Treatment options for achalasia include Botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic balloon dilation, and surgical esophagomyotomy. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of these three strategies in the treatment of achalasia in adults. We constructed a Markov cost-effectiveness model comparing Botox injection, pneumatic balloon dilation, and laparoscopic esophagomyotomy as initial treatments of achalasia. Costs and probabilities were derived from the published literature. The utility for symptomatic achalasia was derived from a sample of patients with achalasia. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Over a five-year time horizon, pneumatic dilation was the most cost-effective treatment strategy for achalasia, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1348 per quality-adjusted life-year compared to Botox. Although laparoscopic esophagomyotomy was more effective than the other treatment options, it was not cost-effective because of its high initial cost. In conclusion, pneumatic dilation is the most cost-effective treatment option for adults with achalasia. Further studies should examine the long-term relapse rates following treatment with Botox and more precisely determine the quality of life of symptomatic achalasia.",

Although rare, it is currently the most common primary esophageal motility disorder, with an annual incidence of around 1.6 per 100,000 persons and prevalence of around 10.8/100,000 persons. Symptoms of achalasia include dysphagia to both solids and liquids, regurgitation, aspiration, chest pain and weight loss. As the underlying etiology of achalasia remains unclear, there is currently no curative treatment for achalasia. Management of achalasia mainly involves improving the esophageal outflow in order to provide symptomatic relief to patients. The most effective treatment options for achalasia include pneumatic dilation, Heller myotomy and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), with the latter increasingly emerging as the treatment of choice for many patients.

Because of uncertain etiology, treatment is only palliative and is directed at decreasing lower esophageal sphincter pressure, improving esophageal emptying and relieving the symptoms of achalasia. Current treatment options include pharmacological, endoscopic and surgical. We undertook a systematic literature review of the management strategies currently available for achalasia. A Medline, PubMed and Cochrane database search was conducted using reference manager 11. Original articles and reviews published in the English literature on the management of achalasia were reviewed. Emphasis was placed on articles published in the last ten years on randomized controlled trials comparing the various forms of treatment. Esophageal manometry is the standard diagnostic evaluation for achalasia. Accurate diagnosis can also be made based on clinical findings and barium esophagogram. Medical treatment with nitrates or calcium channel blockers has variable results in alleviating the symptoms of achalasia but long-term results are disappointing because of tolerance and side effects. Intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilatation and surgical myotomy are variably effective at controlling the symptoms of achalasia but each modality has specific strength and weaknesses which make their choice suitable in a particular group of patients. While pneumatic dilatation is superior to botulinum toxin injection surgical myotomy provides the best long-term control of symptoms in patients with achalasia. Laparoscopic myotomy should be the initial treatment for most patients with achalasia. Pneumatic dilatation is the most cost-effective alternative but its long-term efficacy is less than that of surgical myotomy. Endoscopic botulinum toxin injection can be considered when other forms of treatment are contraindicated.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771371": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques now allow relatively easy and affordable sequencing of large portions of the genome, even for nonmodel organisms. Many phylogenetic studies reduce costs by focusing their sequencing efforts on a selected set of targeted loci, commonly enriched using sequence capture. The advantage of this approach is that it recovers a consistent set of loci, each with high sequencing depth, which leads to more confidence in the assembly of target sequences. High sequencing depth can also be used to identify phylogenetically informative allelic variation within sequenced individuals, but allele sequences are infrequently assembled in phylogenetic studies. Instead, many scientists perform their phylogenetic analyses using contig sequences which result from the de novo assembly of sequencing reads into contigs containing only canonical nucleobases, and this may reduce both statistical power and phylogenetic accuracy. Here, we develop an easy-to-use pipeline to recover allele sequences from sequence capture data, and we use simulated and empirical data to demonstrate the utility of integrating these allele sequences to analyses performed under the multispecies coalescent model. Our empirical analyses of ultraconserved element locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last 3 myr. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences.",

It is characterized by oral mucosal burning and may be associated with dysgeusia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, and xerostomia. The etiology of the disease process is unknown, but is thought to be neuropathic in origin. The goal of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of the various treatments for BMS. Literature searches were conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, which identified 22 randomized controlled trials. Eight studies examined alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), three clonazepam, three psychotherapy, and two capsaicin, which all showed modest evidence of potentially decreasing pain/burning. Gabapentin was seen in one study to work alone and synergistically with ALA. Other treatments included vitamins, benzydamine hydrochloride, bupivacaine, Catuama, olive oil, trazodone, urea, and Hypericum perforatum. Of these other treatments, Catuama and bupivacaine were the only ones with significant positive results in symptom improvement. ALA, topical clonazepam, gabapentin, and psychotherapy may provide modest relief of pain in BMS. Gabapentin may also boost the effect of ALA. Capsaicin is limited by its side effects.

In addition to pain, taste alterations are frequent (dysgeusia, xerostomia). Although lacking clinical signs of neuropathy, more accurate diagnostic methods have shown neuropathic involvement at various levels of the neuraxis in BMS: peripheral small fiber damage (thermal quantitative sensory testing, electrogustatometry, epithelial nerve fiber density), trigeminal system lesions in the periphery or the brainstem (brainstem reflex recordings, trigeminal neurography, evoked potentials), or signs of decreased inhibition within the central nervous system (deficient brainstem reflex habituation, positive signs in quantitative sensory testing, neurotransmitter-positron emission tomography findings indicative of deficient striatal dopamine function). Abnormalities in electrogustatometry indicate the involvement of the small A\u03b4 taste afferents, in addition to somatosensory small fibers. According to these findings, the clinical entity of BMS can be divided into 2 main subtypes compatible with either peripheral or central neuropathic pain, which may overlap in individual patients. The central type does not respond to local treatments and associates often with psychiatric comorbidity (depression or anxiety), whereas the peripheral type responds to peripheral lidocaine blocks and topical clonazepam. Burning mouth syndrome is most prevalent in postmenopausal women, having led to a hypothesis that BMS is triggered as a consequence of nervous system damage caused by neurotoxic factors affecting especially vulnerable small fibers and basal ganglia in a setting of decrease in neuroprotective gonadal hormones and increase in stress hormone levels, typical for menopause.",

This study included data on 202 patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy and had preoperative AFP concentrations \u2265100 ng/mL or DCP \u2265200 mAU/mL. We calculated the HLs of AFP and DCP from their values just before and 1 month after hepatectomy. We identified three groups: a normalization group, tumor marker concentrations within normal range 1 month post-hepatectomy; a long group, HL of AFP \u22657 days or DCP \u22654 days; and a short group, remaining patients. We evaluated associations between HL and prognosis. Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the normalization (n = 70), short (n = 71), and long groups (n = 61) was 41.3%, 46.0%, and 16.8%, respectively (P = 0.002). Five-year overall survival (OS) of normalization, short, and long groups was 72.6, 70.6 and 43.8%, respectively (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that long HL is an independent risk factor for poor RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, P = 0.0006) and poor OS (HR 2.70, P = 0.004). The extrahepatic recurrence rate was 21.3% (13/61) in the long group, which is higher than in the normalization group (8.6%, 6/70) (P = 0.04) and short group (9.9%, 7/71) (P = 0.07). Post-hepatectomy HLs of AFP and DCP are predictors of long-term outcome in patients with HCC.",

We report 7 cases of ovarian SLCT (3 moderately differentiated, 2 poorly differentiated, 2 retiform) with heterologous intestinal-type glands, 6 of which were associated with elevated serum AFP. The intestinal-type mucinous glands were immunoreactive for SALL4 (4 cases), AFP (4 cases), glypican 3 (1 case), CDX2 (6 cases), and villin (7 cases), markers that are commonly expressed in YSTs, although the latter 2 markers would be expected to be positive in intestinal-type glands. We show that heterologous intestinal-type glands in ovarian SLCTs often have an endodermal sinus-like (YST-like) immunophenotype and stress that these should not be misinterpreted as microscopic foci of endodermal-type YST. Cases of ovarian SLCT with elevated serum AFP should be sampled extensively to look for foci of intestinal-type glands, the likely source of the AFP elevation in some of these neoplasms.",

Current guidelines for high-risk patients include ultrasound screenings every six months, but ultrasounds are operator dependent and not sensitive for early HCC. Serum \u03b1-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used diagnostic biomarker, but it has limited sensitivity and is not elevated in all HCC cases so, we incorporate a second blood-based biomarker, des'\u03b3 carboxy-prothrombin (DCP), that has shown potential as a screening marker for HCC. The data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial is a valuable source of data to study biomarker screening for HCC. We assume the trajectories of AFP and DCP follow a joint hierarchical mixture model with random changepoints that allows for distinct changepoint times and subsequent trajectories of each biomarker. The changepoint indicators are jointly modeled with a Markov Random Field distribution to help detect borderline changepoints. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to calculate posterior distributions, which are used in risk calculations among future patients and determine whether a patient has a positive screen. The screening algorithm was compared to alternatives in simulations studies under a range of possible scenarios and in the HALT-C Trial using cross-validation.",

TGF-\u03b21 was overexpressed and transforming growth factor receptor 1 (TGF-\u03b2-R1) was knocked down by a lentiviral vector in mouse hepatic stellate cells (mHSCs). Transfection efficiency was assessed with immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The downstream genes alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), Jagged1 and the differentiation markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), cytokeratin19 (CK19), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), and hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) were measured with qRT-PCR and western blotting. SpHBLV-CMVIE-TGF-\u03b21, pHBLV-CMVIE-GFP, pHBLV-U6-TGF-\u03b2-R1 shRNA, and pHBLV-U6-RFP were successfully transfected. Over-expression of the TGF-\u03b21 gene caused mHSCs to transform into myofibroblasts (MFs) and expression of Jagged1 and cholangiocyte markers (CK19, SOX9, Hes1) were significantly upregulated (P&lt;0.01). Importantly, after blocking TGF-\u03b21 signaling via gene silencing, expression of Jagged1 was much reduced, but the mature hepatocyte marker (ALB) was obviously increased. In addition, AFP, a hepatic stem cell marker, was expressed at the highest level in the control groups. Our findings emphasize that the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway regulates expression of Jagged1 in mHSCs which is associated with transformation of mHSCs into MFs, thus demonstrating a novel mechanism via which TGF-\u03b21 signaling controls the differentiation fate of mHSCs through regulation of the Jagged1/Notch pathway.",

Yeast prions, including the best studied ones ([PSI <sup>+</sup>] and [URE3]), propagate via intimate interactions with molecular chaperones. Different yeast prions exhibit differential responses to changes in levels, functionality or localization of the components of chaperone machinery. Here, we provide additional data confirming differential effects of chaperones (and specifically, Hsp40s) on yeast prions and summarize current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying chaperone specificities. Contrary to frequent statements in literature, overproduction of the Hsp104 chaperone antagonizes both [PSI <sup>+</sup>] and [URE3] prions, while overproduction of the Hsp70-Ssa1 chaperone antagonizes [URE3] prion only in some, but not in all strains. Recently, we demonstrated that the relocalization of a fraction of the Hsp40 chaperone Sis1 from the cytosol to the nucleus by the chaperone-sorting factor Cur1 exhibits opposite effects on [PSI <sup>+</sup>] and [URE3] prions. We suggest that the response of prions to changes in Sis1 localization represents a combination of the effects of Sis1 shortage on fragmentation of prion aggregates and on malpartition of prion aggregates during a cell division. Differences in sensitivity of prion fragmentation to Sis1 and in relative inputs of fragmentation and malpartition in prion propagation result in opposite effects of Sis1 relocalization on [PSI <sup>+</sup>] and [URE3].",

Initial nucleation of a yeast prion by transiently overproduced prion-forming protein or its (typically, QN-rich) prion domain is efficient only in the presence of another aggregated (in most cases, QN-rich) protein. Here, we demonstrate that a fusion of the prion domain of yeast protein Sup35 to some non-QN-rich mammalian proteins, associated with amyloid diseases, promotes nucleation of Sup35 prions in the absence of pre-existing aggregates. In contrast, both a fusion of the Sup35 prion domain to a multimeric non-amyloidogenic protein and the expression of a mammalian amyloidogenic protein that is not fused to the Sup35 prion domain failed to promote prion nucleation, further indicating that physical linkage of a mammalian amyloidogenic protein to the prion domain of a yeast protein is required for the nucleation of a yeast prion. Biochemical and cytological approaches confirmed the nucleation of protein aggregates in the yeast cell. Sequence alterations antagonizing or enhancing amyloidogenicity of human amyloid-\u03b2 (associated with Alzheimer's disease) and mouse prion protein (associated with prion diseases), respectively, antagonized or enhanced nucleation of a yeast prion by these proteins. The yeast-based prion nucleation assay, developed in our work, can be employed for mutational dissection of amyloidogenic proteins.

The folded in-register parallel \u03b2 sheet architecture of the yeast prion amyloids naturally suggests a mechanism by which prion variant information can be faithfully transmitted for many generations. The yeast prions rely on cellular chaperones for their propagation, but can be cured by various chaperone imbalances. The Btn2/Cur1 system normally cures most variants of the [URE3] prion that arise. Although most variants of the [PSI+] and [URE3] prions are toxic or lethal, some are mild in their effects.

In yeast, amyloid underlies several non-Mendelian phenotypes referred to as yeast prions. Mechanism of amyloid formation is critical for a complete understanding of the yeast prion phenomenon and human amyloid-related diseases. Ure2 protein is the basis of yeast prion [URE3]. The Ure2p prion domain is largely disordered. Residual structures, if any, in the disordered region may play an important role in the aggregation process. Studies of Ure2p prion domain are complicated by its high aggregation propensity, which results in a mixture of monomer and aggregates in solution. Previously we have developed a solid-support electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) approach to address this problem and have identified a structured state for the Alzheimer's amyloid-\u03b2 monomer. Here we use solid-support EPR to study the structure of Ure2p prion domain. EPR spectra of Ure2p prion domain with spin labels at every fifth residue from position 10 to position 75 show similar residue mobility profile for denaturing and native buffers after accounting for the effect of solution viscosity. These results suggest that Ure2p prion domain adopts a completely disordered structure in the native buffer. A completely disordered Ure2p prion domain implies that the amyloid formation of Ure2p, and likely other Q/N-rich yeast prion proteins, is primarily driven by inter-molecular interactions.",

This effect is reversed by an excess of the chaperone Hsp70-Ssa. Here we show that the actions of Hsp104 and Ssa on [PSI(+)] are modulated by the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide cochaperone Sgt2. Sgt2 is conserved from yeast to humans, has previously been implicated in the guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) trafficking pathway, and is known to interact with Hsps, cytosolic Get proteins, and tail-anchored proteins. We demonstrate that Sgt2 increases the ability of excess Ssa to counteract [PSI(+)] curing by excess Hsp104. Deletion of SGT2 also restores trafficking of a tail-anchored protein in cells with a disrupted GET pathway. One region of Sgt2 interacts both with the prion domain of Sup35 and with tail-anchored proteins. Sgt2 levels are increased in response to the presence of a prion when major Hsps are not induced.

The true cost of this therapy, including the cost of morbidities associated with its use, remains to be determined.Severe asthma in pediatrics poses a unique opportunity for possible prevention strategies and the potential for primary prevention. Although several avenues for primary prevention are being explored and are out of the scope of this review, we focus our discussion on the use of omalizumab, which has been recently explored in clinical trials. Appropriate use of biologics in severe asthma should be supported by further understanding of biomarkers predicting response to targeted therapy. Because of their association with significant adverse effects, add-on oral corticosteroids should be considered a last treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. Finally, severe asthma in pediatrics poses a unique opportunity for potential prevention strategies.",

Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 play a key role in type 2 (T2) asthma. This article reviews the signaling pathway of IL-4 and IL-13 and highlights its targeted therapy in severe asthma. Several clinical trials of biologics targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway have recently been completed. In patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma, targeting IL-13 alone with biologics including lebrikizumab and tralokinumab has not shown consistent reduction in asthma exacerbations. Simultaneous targeting of both IL-4 and IL-13 by blocking IL-4 receptor \u03b1 using dupilumab has yielded more consistent results in reducing asthma exacerbations and improving lung function, especially in patients with increased blood eosinophils. Other biomarkers of T2 inflammation such as exhaled nitric oxide and serum periostin may also predict response to biologics targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway. No biologic targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway is currently available for treatment of asthma, but emerging data suggest that biologics targeting IL-4 and IL-13 together may benefit patients with T2 high asthma. Additional data are needed about long-term efficacy and safety prior to incorporating these drugs into routine clinical practice.",

Regardless of effective treatments being widely available and the existence of treatment guidelines, a large population of severe asthma cases remain uncontrolled. Achieving and maintaining asthma control in this group of patients is, therefore, of utmost importance. The recognition of distinct inflammatory phenotypes within this population has driven the development of targeted biological therapies - particularly, selective targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

Many syndromes and malformations (e.g., anophthalmia-esophageal-genital syndrome, Matthew-Wood syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, oculo-facial-cardio-dental-syndome, heterotaxy, and Fraser syndrome) have been associated with anophthalmia. However, its relation with congenital heart disease has not been fully elucidated. In this article, we discuss two cases of patients with anophthalmia and congenital heart defects, and we compare these findings with other syndromes with which anophthalmia has been associated. One of our two patients showed complex congenital heart disease with heterotaxia, polysplenia, and normal lung lobation.

Until nowhearing loss has not been reported in individuals with <i>SOX2</i> mutation. The results remind us that clinical anophthalmia may be accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss and may be associated with <i>SOX2</i> mutation, and it will contribute to improving diagnosis and patient care.

Anophthalmia may be isolated or associated with a broader syndrome and may have genetic or environmental causes. However, genetic cause has been defined in only a small proportion of cases, therefore, a consanguineous Pakistani family of the Pashtoon ethnic group, with isolated clinical anophthalmia was investigated using linkage mapping. A family pedigree was created to trace the possible mode of inheritance of the disease. Blood samples were collected from affected as well as normal members of this family, and screened for disease-associated mutations. This family was analyzed for linkage to all the known loci of clinical anophthalmia, using microsatellite short tandem repeat (STR) markers. Direct sequencing was performed to find out disease-associated mutations in the candidate gene. This family with isolated clinical anophthalmia, was mapped to the <i>SOX2</i> gene that is located at chromosome 3q26.3-q27.

Heterozygous mutations in SOX2, a SOX1B-HMG box transcription factor, have been found in up to 10% of individuals with severe microphthalmia or anophthalmia and such mutations could also be associated with a range of non-ocular abnormalities. We performed mutation analysis on a new cohort of 120 patients with congenital eye abnormalities, mainly anophthalmia, microphthalmia and coloboma. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) were used to detect whole gene deletion. We identified four novel intragenic SOX2 mutations (one single base deletion, one single base duplication and two point mutations generating premature translational termination codons) and two further cases with the previously reported c.70del20 mutation. Of 52 patients with severe microphthalmia or anophthalmia analysed by MLPA, 5 were found to be deleted for the whole SOX2 gene and 1 had a partial deletion. In two of these, FISH studies identified sub-microscopic deletions involving a minimum of 328 Kb and 550 Kb. The SOX2 phenotypes include a patient with anophthalmia, oesophageal abnormalities and horseshoe kidney, and a patient with a retinal dystrophy implicating SOX2 in retinal development. Our results provide further evidence that SOX2 haploinsufficiency is a common cause of severe developmental ocular malformations and that background genetic variation determines the varying phenotypes. Given the high incidence of whole gene deletion we recommend that all patients with severe microphthalmia or anophthalmia, including unilateral cases be screened by MLPA and FISH for SOX2 deletions.",

Using C. elegans embryos we show that the LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease defines a previously undescribed genome integrity mechanism by processing DNA bridges right before cells divide. LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis. LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatin bridges are trapped at the cleavage plane. LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase. Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity. These findings provide a molecular basis for the suspected role of the LEM-3 orthologue Ankle1 in human breast cancer.",

It is of considerable importance to work out how recombination intermediates are processed, leading to CO and non-crossover (NCO) outcome. Genetic analysis in budding yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans indicates that the processing of meiotic recombination intermediates involves a combination of nucleases and DNA repair enzymes. We previously reported that in C. elegans meiotic joint molecule resolution is mediated by two redundant pathways, conferred by the SLX-1 and MUS-81 nucleases, and by the HIM-6 Bloom helicase in conjunction with the XPF-1 endonuclease, respectively. Both pathways require the scaffold protein SLX-4. However, in the absence of all these enzymes, residual processing of meiotic recombination intermediates still occurs and CO formation is reduced but not abolished. Here we show that the LEM-3 nuclease, mutation of which by itself does not have an overt meiotic phenotype, genetically interacts with slx-1 and mus-81 mutants, the respective double mutants displaying 100% embryonic lethality. The combined loss of LEM-3 and MUS-81 leads to altered processing of recombination intermediates, a delayed disassembly of foci associated with CO designated sites, and the formation of univalents linked by SPO-11 dependent chromatin bridges (dissociated bivalents). However, LEM-3 foci do not colocalize with ZHP-3, a marker that congresses into CO designated sites. In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations. Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants. Supported by the localization of LEM-3 between dividing meiotic nuclei, this data suggest that LEM-3 is able to process erroneous recombination intermediates that persist into the second meiotic division.",

We confirm that LEM-3 has DNase activity in vitro. lem-3(lf) mutants are hypersensitive to various types of DNA damage, including ionizing radiation, UV-C light and crosslinking agents. Embryos from irradiated lem-3 hermaphrodites displayed severe defects during cell division, including chromosome mis-segregation and anaphase bridges.

Despite being emblematic of the New Guinea fauna, no previous phylogenetic studies have been conducted on the Eupholini. In addition to a comprehensive collection of fresh specimens, we supplement our taxon sampling with museum specimens, and this study is the first target enrichment phylogenomic dataset incorporating beetle specimens from museum collections. We use both concatenated and species tree analyses to examine the relationships and taxonomy of this group. For species tree analyses we present a novel partitioning strategy to better model the molecular evolutionary process in UCEs. We found that the current taxonomy is problematic, largely grouping species on the basis of similar color patterns. Finally, our results show that most loci required multiple partitions for nucleotide rate substitution, suggesting that single partitions may not be the optimal partitioning strategy to accommodate rate heterogeneity for UCE loci.",

The seven immunologically distinct serotypes of BoNTs (A-G), each produced by various strains of Clostridium botulinum, act on the neuromuscular junction by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby resulting in flaccid muscle paralysis. BoNTs are synthesized as single inactive polypeptide chains that are cleaved by endogenous or exogenous proteases to generate the active dichain form of the toxin. Nicking of the single chain BoNT/E to the dichain form is associated with 100-fold increase in toxicity. Here we investigated the activation mechanism of botulinum neurotoxin type E upon nicking and subsequent reduction of disulfide bond. It was observed that nicking of BoNT/E significantly enhances its endopeptidase activity and that at the physiological temperature of 37 degrees C the reduced form of nicked BoNT/E adopts a dynamically flexible conformation resulting from the exposure of hydrophobic segments and facilitating optimal cleavage of its substrate SNAP-25. Such reduction-induced increase in the flexibility of the polypeptide folding provides a rationale for the mechanism of BoNT/E endopeptidase against its intracellular substrate, SNAP-25, and complements current understanding of the mechanistics of interaction between the substrate and BoNT endopeptidase.",

For more than a century they are known to be the cause of botulism, a nowadays rare intoxication with spoiled food that leads to generalized flaccid weakness of striated muscle including pharyngeal and respiratory musculature. The toxins act primarily at peripheral cholinergic motor nerve endings by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. As a consequence, action potentials in the motor nerve can no longer be transmitted to the muscle. This lack in transmission, clinically appearing as weakness, may disable or actually critically endanger affected patients. However, in certain neurological diseases characterized by an abnormal increase in muscle tone or activity, for example dystonia or spasticity, a reduction in signal transmission may actually be beneficial. Around 1980 local injections of minute amounts (in the order of 0.5 ng) of Botulinum toxin type A were first successfully used in a neurological disorder named blepharospasm which is characterized by an involuntary squinting of the eyes. Since then Botulinum toxin has developed rapidly from a frightful poison to a safe therapeutic agent with a remarkable beneficial impact on the quality of life of many thousands of patients worldwide.

The toxins act primarily at peripheral cholinergic synapses by blocking the evoked release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. There are seven distinct serotypes of toxin. All are polypeptides of Mr about 150 kDa that have similar structure and pharmacological action. In their most active forms the toxins exist as dichain molecules in which a heavy (H) chain is linked by disulphide bonding to a light (L) chain. The H chain is believed to be associated with the highly specific and avid binding of toxin to the motor nerve end plates and also with the process of internalisation of the toxin. The toxic activity appears to be associated with the L chain which blockades the calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine, probably by interfering at the molecular level with the mechanisms whereby neurotransmitter-containing vesicles merge with the plasmalemma. The type A toxin is now used therapeutically to treat a variety of conditions involving involuntary muscle spasm. The therapeutic toxin is a neurotoxin-haemagglutinin complex isolated from cultures of C. botulinum.

It is caused by either the ingestion of the toxin or the bacteria, inhalation, or wound infection. We present our observations with a descriptive case series of wound botulism secondary to black tar heroin (BTH) injection. We report a retrospective single-center case series of 15 consecutive cases of wound botulism presenting to University Medical Center of El Paso. Medical records where reviewed to obtain demographic information, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome. We identified fifteen patients with mean age of 47 years: twelve men, and three women. All had administered BTH through skin popping and had abscesses in the administration areas. By history, the most common symptoms were dysphagia (66%), proximal muscle weakness of upper and lower extremity (60%), neck flexor muscle weakness (33%), ophthalmoplegia (53%), bilateral ptosis (46%), dysarthria (53%), double vision (40%), blurred vision (33%), and dry mouth (20%). During the examination, the most common features noted were: proximal muscle weakness of upper and lower extremities (73%), ophthalmoplegia (53%), ptosis (46%). In patients with documented wound botulism, the pupils were reactive in 46%. All patients required mechanical ventilation and were treated with the trivalent antitoxin. Eleven patients (73.3%) were discharged home, two were transferred to a skill nursing facility, and two were transferred to long-term acute care facility. In our patients, BTH injection, involving the action of injecting under the skin acetylated morphine derivatives (mostly 6-monoacetylmorphine and 3-monoacetylmorphine), was associated with the development of botulism. The availability of BTH at the US-Mexican border is not surprising since it is frequently produced in Latin America. Its association with the development of botulism should be recognized early to allow a prompt diagnosis and treatment with the antitoxin. A clinical feature worth noting is the presence of normal pupillary light reflex in nearly half of patients. Therefore, the presence of a normal pupillary response does not exclude the presence of wound botulism.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14747968": "Infant botulism represents a distinct entity of botulism. Ingestion of the ubiquitously present spores of Clostridium botulinum leads to germination of the organism and neurotoxin production in the infant intestine. Symptoms typically develop gradually in contrast to classical food botulism in which an acute onset of symptoms shortly after the ingestion of preformed toxin in a food is characteristic. Microbiologically, the diagnosis is established by identification of Clostridium botulinum organism and toxin in stool specimen. However, positive results in these tests provide only indirect evidence for the clinical relevance of the neurotoxin since asymptomatic carriers have been found. The toxin irreversibly blocks the release of acetylcholin from the motoric end plate which results in muscle weakness and paralysis. Depending on the amount of toxin produced, infant botulism exhibits a broad clinical spectrum ranging from oligosymptomatic forms to a fulminant course with acute respiratory failure within hours leading to sudden death. Unrecognized mild forms or beginning muscle weakness can be a co-factor for other risk factors of sudden infant death (SIDS). In studies analyzing infants who died from SIDS, botulism bacteria or toxin were found in up to 20 % of cases. Infant botulism therefore represents an important differential diagnosis of unexplained and inconclusive muscular hypotonia in the first year of life.",

Cerebellar hemorrhages in pediatric population are rare and mainly due to head injuries, rupture of vascular malformations, infections, or hematological diseases. We have investigated the still controversial and unclear pathophysiology underlying intratumoral hemorrhage in PAs. Bleeding in low-grade tumors might be related to structural abnormalities and specific angio-architecture of tumor vessels, such as degenerative mural hyalinization, \"glomeruloid\" endothelial proliferation, presence of encased micro-aneurysms, and glioma-induced neoangiogenesis. The acute hemorrhagic presentation of cerebellar PA in childhood although extremely uncommon is of critical clinical importance and necessitates promptly treatment. We described a case of hemorrhagic cerebellar PA in a 9-year-old child and reviewed the English-language literature that reported spontaneous hemorrhagic histologically proven cerebellar PA in pediatric patients (0-18 years). According to our analysis, the mortality was not related to symptom onset, tumor location, hemorrhage distribution, presence of acute hydrocephalous, and timing of surgery, while the GCS at hospital admission resulted to be the only statistically significant prognostic factor affecting survival outcome. The abrupt onset of signs and symptoms of acute hydrocephalous and consequent raised intracranial pressure are life-threatening conditions, which need emergent medical and neurosurgical treatments.

Microbiota composition was altered in STING<sup>-/-</sup> mice toward a more inflammatory profile, evidencing a reduction in the Allobacolum and Bifidobacterium groups along with increase in Disulfovibrio bacteria. Absence of STING lead to decrease in induced intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and to increase in group 1 innate lymphoid cell (ILC1) as well as ILC3 frequencies and decrease in ILC2 in the colon. Development and function of Foxp3+ and LAP+ regulatory T cells were also compromised in STING<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Moreover, these mice were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, T-cell-induced colitis, and enteric Salmonella typhimurium infection when compared with WT animals. Therefore, our results identify an important role of STING in maintaining gut homeostasis and also a protective effect in controlling gut inflammation.",

The innate immune pathways involved in these events are known to be regulated by cellular molecules such as stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which controls type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to the presence of microbial DNA or cytosolic DNA that has escaped from the nucleus. STING signaling has been shown to be defective in a variety of cancers, such as colon cancer and melanoma, actions that may enable damaged cells to escape the immunosurveillance system. Here, we report through examination of databases that STING signaling may be commonly suppressed in a greater variety of tumors due to loss-of-function mutation or epigenetic silencing of the STING/cGAS promoter regions. In comparison, RNA activated innate immune pathways controlled by RIG-I/MDA5 were significantly less affected. Examination of reported missense STING variants confirmed that many exhibited a loss-of-function phenotype and could not activate cytokine production following exposure to cytosolic DNA or DNA-damage events. Our data imply that the STING signaling pathway may be recurrently suppressed by a number of mechanisms in a considerable variety of malignant disease and be a requirement for cellular transformation.",

UPDs are rare events of chromosomal malsegregation and describe the condition of two homologous chromosomes or homologous chromosomal segments that were inherited from one parent. The occurrence of UPD can be of major clinical relevance. Though high-throughput molecular screening techniques are widely used, detection of UPDs and especially the subclassification remains complex. We developed UPDtool to detect and classify UPDs from SNP microarray data of parent-child trios. The algorithm was tested using five positive controls including both iso- and heterodisomic segmental UPDs and 30 trios from the HapMap project as negative controls. With UPDtool, we were able to correctly identify all occurrences of non-mosaic UPD within our positive controls, whereas no occurrence of UPD was found within our negative controls. In addition, the chromosomal breakage points could be determined more precisely than by microsatellite analysis. Our results were compared with both the gold standard, microsatellite analysis and SNPtrio, another program available for UPD detection. UPDtool is platform independent, light weight and flexible. Because of its simple input format, UPDtool may also be used with other high-throughput technologies (e.g., next-generation sequencing).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17564968": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), either with or without accompanying copy-number loss, is a cardinal feature of cancer genomes that is tightly linked to cancer development. However, detection of LOH is frequently hampered by the presence of normal cell components within tumor specimens and the limitation in availability of constitutive DNA. Here, we describe a simple but highly sensitive method for genomewide detection of allelic composition, based on the Affymetrix single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotyping microarray platform, without dependence on the availability of constitutive DNA. By sensing subtle distortions in allele-specific signals caused by allelic imbalance with the use of anonymous controls, sensitive detection of LOH is enabled with accurate determination of allele-specific copy numbers, even in the presence of up to 70%-80% normal cell contamination. The performance of the new algorithm, called \"AsCNAR\" (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references), was demonstrated by detecting the copy-number neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having disti<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct 9\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">nct 9</a>p UPD within the same MPD specimen.

One of the commonly used approaches to treat metastatic prostate cancer was via first-generation nonsteroidal anti-androgens (NSAAs), namely flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide and topilutamide. Most prostate cancer patients who are initially responsive develop the most aggressive form of disease called castration-resistant prostate cancer. Second-generation NSAA receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide) are emerging as additional new options to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. The objective of this work was to review the literature on the bioanalytical methods for the quantification of first- and second-generation NSAA inhibitors in clinical (human plasma) and preclinical (mouse plasma, rat plasma, urine and tissue homogenates etc.) studies along with relevant case studies for some chosen drugs. Based on the review, it was concluded that the published methodologies using either HPLC or LC-MS/MS are well suited for the quantification of NSAA inhibitors in various biological fluids to delineate pharmacokinetic data.",

The effects on autophagic flux (LC3A, p62, TFEB, LAMP2a, cathepsin D) and cell metabolism-related enzymes (hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1/2\u03b1, BNIP3, carbonic anhydrase 9, LDHA, PDH, PDH-kinase) were also studied. The 22Rv1 cell line responded to testosterone by increasing the nuclear entry of AR, AR-V7, and phosphorylated AR and by increasing the levels of prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2. This effect was strongly abrogated by ARN and to a clearly lower extent by bicalutamide at 10 \u03bcmol/l, both in normoxia and in hypoxia. ARN had a stronger antiproliferative effect than bicalutamide, which was prominent in the 22Rv1 hormone-responsive cell line, and completely repressed cell proliferation at a concentration of 100 \u03bcmol/l. No effect of testosterone or of antiandrogens on autophagy flux, hypoxia-related proteins, or metabolism enzyme levels was noted. The PC3 and DU145 cell lines showed poor expression of the proteins and were not responsive to testosterone.

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Merck's anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), received accelerated approval in May 2017 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR). Shortly after, nivolumab (Opdivo), Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1 mAb, gained an accelerated approval in August 2017 for adult and pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. These regulatory approvals marked an important milestone that a cancer treatment may be approved based on a common biomarker rather than the anatomic location in the body where the tumor originated, and therefore established a precedent for tumor type-agnostic therapy. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Both the anti-PD-1 mAbs and the TRK-targeting therapies share some basic features: (a) biomarker-based, well-defined rare patient population; (b) exceptionally high clinical efficacy, e.g., near 40% overall response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab across 15 tumor types with MSI-H/dMMR and 75% ORR for larotrectinib across more than 12 tumor types with NTRK-fusion proteins; (c) durable responses lasting at least 6 months with complete responses observed; and (d) parallel development in adult and pediatric populations.

These fusions drive constitutive expression and ligand-independent activation of the TRK kinase and are oncogenic. Larotrectinib is the first highly potent and selective small molecule ATP competitive inhibitor of all three TRK kinases to enter clinical development. <b>Areas covered</b>: This review covers the current preclinical and clinical evidence for TRK inhibitors for TRK fusion cancers, focusing on larotrectinib. <b>Expert commentary</b>: Larotrectinib has demonstrated a remarkable 75% centrally confirmed objective response rate in patients with TRK fusion cancers in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials with generally mild side effects. Responses appear independent of the patient's age, underlying histology, and specific fusion partner and are durable in many patients. Larotrectinib is likely to be the first FDA-approved histology-agnostic molecularly targeted therapy. The evolving role of molecular profiling of advanced cancers is discussed.",

In the current study, the authors describe the clinical course of children with locally advanced TRK fusion sarcoma who were treated preoperatively with larotrectinib and underwent subsequent surgical resection. A total of 24 children were treated on a pediatric phase 1 trial of larotrectinib (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02637687\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02637687</a>). Five children who had a documented TRK fusion sarcoma and underwent surgical resection were included in the current analysis. Tumor response (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) and surgical outcomes were collected prospectively. A total of 5 patients (median age, 2 years; range, 0.4-12 years) had locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma (3 patients) or soft-tissue sarcoma (2 patients). Four patients had disease that was refractory to standard therapy. All 5 patients achieved a partial response to larotrectinib by version 1.1 of RECIST and underwent surgical resection after a median of 6 cycles (range, 4-9 cycles) of treatment. Surgical resections were R0 (negative resection margins with no tumor at the inked resection margin) in 3 patients, R1 (microscopic residual tumor at the resection margin) in 1 patient, and R2 (macroscopic residual tumor at the resection margin) in 1 patient. Three patients achieved complete (2 patients) or near-complete (&gt;98% treatment effect; 1 patient) pathologic responses. These patients remained in follow-up and were no longer receiving larotrectinib for a minimum of 7 to 15 months postoperatively. Two patients had viable tumor at the time of surgical resection and positive resection margins and continued to receive adjuvant larotrectinib. No patients experienced postoperative complications or wound healing issues. Children with locally advanced TRK fusion sarcomas may proceed to surgical resection after treatment with the selective TRK inhibitor larotrectinib, thereby sparing them the potentially significant morbidity noted with current approaches. These results support the evaluation of larotrectinib as presurgical therapy in children with newly diagnosed TRK fusion sarcomas.",

In this context, gene fusions as one important example of genetic aberrations leading to carcinogenesis follow the widely accepted concept that cell growth and proliferation are driven by the accomplished fusion (usually involving former proto-oncogenes) and may therefore be successfully inhibited by substances directed against the fusion. This concept has already been established with oncogenic gene fusions like BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in lung cancer, including special tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which are able to block the activation of the depending downstream proliferation pathways and, consequently, tumor growth. During the last decade, the NTRK1, 2, and 3 genes, encoding the TRKA, B, and C proteins, have attracted increasing attention as another significant and targetable gene fusion in a variety of cancers. Several TRK inhibitors have been developed, and one of them, Larotrectinib (formerly known as LOXO-101), represents an orally available, selective inhibitor of the TRK receptor family that has already shown substantial clinical benefit in both pediatric and adult patients harboring an NTRK gene fusion over the last few years.",

Although responses to TRK inhibition can be dramatic and durable, duration of response may eventually be limited by acquired resistance. LOXO-195 is a selective TRK TKI designed to overcome acquired resistance mediated by recurrent kinase domain (solvent front and xDFG) mutations identified in multiple patients who have developed resistance to TRK TKIs. Activity against these acquired mutations was confirmed in enzyme and cell-based assays and <i>in vivo</i> tumor models. As clinical proof of concept, the first 2 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers who developed acquired resistance mutations on larotrectinib were treated with LOXO-195 on a first-in-human basis, utilizing rapid dose titration guided by pharmacokinetic assessments. This approach led to rapid tumor responses and extended the overall duration of disease control achieved with TRK inhibition in both patients.<b>Significance:</b> LOXO-195 abrogated resistance in TRK fusion-positive cancers that acquired kinase domain mutations, a shared liability with all existing TRK TKIs.

Here we provide the first insight into the molecular variation and evolutionary history of the endemic Australian scorpion <i>Urodacus yaschenkoi</i>. Also known as the inland robust scorpion, it is widely distributed throughout arid zones of the continent and is emerging as a model organism in biomedical research due to the chemical nature of its venom. We employed Bayesian Inference (BI) methods for the phylogenetic reconstructions and divergence dating among lineages, using unique haplotype sequences from two mitochondrial loci (<i>COXI</i>, 16<i>S</i>) and one nuclear locus (28<i>S</i>). We also implemented two DNA taxonomy approaches (GMYC and PTP/dPTP) to evaluate the presence of cryptic species. Linear Discriminant Analysis was used to test whether the linear combination of 21 variables (ratios of morphological measurements) can predict individual's membership to a putative species. Genetic and morphological data suggest that <i>U. yaschenkoi</i> is a species complex. High statistical support for the monophyly of several divergent lineages was found both at the mitochondrial loci and at a nuclear locus. The extent of mitochondrial divergence between these lineages exceeds estimates of interspecific divergence reported for other scorpion groups. The GMYC model and the PTP/bPTP approach identified major lineages and several sub-lineages as putative species. Ratios of several traits that approximate body shape had a strong predictive power (83-100%) in discriminating two major molecular lineages. A time-calibrated phylogeny dates the early divergence at the onset of continental-wide aridification in late Miocene and Pliocene, with finer-scale phylogeographic patterns emerging during the Pleistocene. This structuring dynamics is congruent with the diversification history of other fauna of the Australian arid zones. Our results indicate that the taxonomic status of <i>U. yaschenkoi</i> requires revision, and we provide recommendations for such future efforts. A complex evolutionary history and extensive diversity highlights the importance of conserving <i>U. yaschenkoi</i> populations from different Australian arid zones in order to preserve patterns of endemism and evolutionary potential.",

Both subspecies have invasive potential and are organisms of concern for areas outside their native range, though they are important bees to beekeepers, agriculture, and the environment where they are native. The aim of the present study was to examine genetic differentiation among these subspecies and estimate their phylogenetic relationships using complete mitochondrial genomes sequences. We used 25 individuals that were either assigned to one of the subspecies or designated hybrids using morphometric analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of mitogenome sequences by maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference identified a monophyletic RSA clade, subdivided into two clades. A haplotype network was consistent with the phylogenetic trees. However, members of both subspecies occurred in both clades, indicating that A.m. capensis and A.m. scutellata are neither reciprocally monophyletic nor do they exhibit paraphyly with one subspecies nested within the other subspecies. Furthermore, no mitogenomic features were diagnostic to either subspecies. All bees analyzed from the RSA expressed a substantial level of haplotype diversity (most samples had unique haplotypes) but limited nucleotide diversity.

The etiology and pathophysiology of this condition remains elusive. Nevertheless, clonal plasma cells and monoclonal protein appear to be major contributors. The early diagnosis of TEMPI syndrome is essential because therapies targeting the underlying plasma cells can lead to a dramatic response. Bortezomib-based chemotherapy, daratumumab monotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can result in reversal of most manifestations. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of TEMPI syndrome remains a substantial challenge owing to its rarity and the complexity of clinical presentations.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501129": "Some dermatologic entities are strongly associated with the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy. They should be referred to as monoclonal gammopathy of cutaneous significance (MGCS). A short review of the main entities that fit into the spectrum of MGCS is provided. Amyloidosis, macroglobulinoderma and follicular hyperkeratotic spicules result from extravascular immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-related protein deposition. Skin findings include papules and plaques, follicular spicules, purpura, haemorrhagic bullae, macroglossia and nail changes. The skin findings in cryoglobulinemia (CG) result from vascular immunoglobulin deposition, either as immune complexes within the vessel walls in mixed CG or within the lumina of small vessels in monoclonal CG. Mixed CG manifests as palpable purpura of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and monoclonal CG as stellar and/or retiform purpura that can evolve into extensive skin necrosis. In some rare instances, immunoglobulins have a specific biological activity. This is, for example, the case when they bind lipoproteins that precipitate and induce hypocomplementemic xanthomas. Xanthoderma related to antiflavin activity of the monoclonal component or acquired angioedema related to anti-C1INH activity is other example. Abnormal cytokine secretion is the hallmark of some entities. High vascular endothelial growth factor levels correlate with some of the skin manifestations of the Polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal component skin changes syndrome, such as hypertrichosis or the adenopathy and extensive skin patch overlying plasmacytoma syndrome. All the clinical manifestations of the Schnitzler syndrome are IL-1 mediated. In other MGCS, such as scleromyxedema, Clarkson syndrome, TEMPI syndrome, cutis laxa and the neutrophilic dermatoses, the link between the monoclocal component and the entity is clearly established, but not understood so far.",

It is best classified as a type of plasma cell dyscrasia with paraneoplastic manifestations, similar to POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin abnormalities). To date, 11 patients have been identified. This is the first morphologic review of TEMPI syndrome bone marrow samples, in order to define pathologic features that may aid in the recognition of the syndrome and to identify post-therapy changes. Seven bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from three patients, including two post-treatment marrows, were examined. Patients were 36, 49, and 49 years old at time of diagnosis. In all cases, erythropoietin levels were extremely elevated at &gt;5000 IU/l, the paraprotein was IgG kappa, JAK2 V617F was negative and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were normal. In one case, the increase in clonal plasma cells reached levels of smoldering myeloma (18%), but remaining marrows showed few monoclonal plasma cells (&lt;5%). All pre-treatment biopsies showed erythroid hyperplasia, with mild nonspecific megakaryocytic, and erythroid cytologic atypia in one marrow. Prominent plasma cell vacuolization and reactive-appearing lymphoid aggregates were noted in one case. Findings of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including megakaryocyte clusters and fibrosis, were not identified. In conclusion, TEMPI syndrome should be considered when erythrocytosis and plasma cell dyscrasia coexist. The bone marrow findings, although nonspecific, differ significantly from polycythemia vera. Peculiar clinical and laboratorial findings of TEMPI, including elevated erythropoietin and normal vascular endothelial growth factor level, allow the diagnosis and distinction from POEMS syndrome. Significant decrease in erythropoietin level following treatment suggests a role of erythropoietin in monitoring therapeutic response.",

The underlying pathophysiology is unknown, though it has been postulated that the monoclonal gammopathy may play a causal role. A 37-year-old non-smoking male presented to our institution with a fever and the sensation of fullness in the right flank. His exam was notable for telangiectasias, clubbing of the fingernails, plethora, and a palpable bulge in the right flank. Renal ultrasound demonstrated bilateral perinephric fluid collections. Laboratory evaluation revealed erythrocytosis with low serum erythropoietin, and testing for the JAK2V617F mutation was positive, confirming a diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Though his room air saturation was normal at rest, it decreased dramatically with exercise, felt to be secondary to microscopic intrapulmonary shunting. The patient's presentation is very similar to that of the TEMPI syndrome, a very rare syndrome of which there have been six published cases. In contrast to the TEMPI syndrome where the erythrocytosis is driven by highly elevated serum erythropoietin, our patient was found to have polycythemia vera. Also in contrast to the other patients with TEMPI syndrome, our patient did not have an identifiable monoclonal gammopathy. Our patient responded to treatment with hydroxyurea. His erythrocytosis, perinephric fluid collections, and telangiectasias resolved over the course of six months. The intrapulmonary shunting has continued to gradually improve with treatment, suggesting that this is an entirely reversible process. Our case is the first to describe the combination of polycythemia vera, telangiectasias, perinephric fluid collections, and intrapulmonary shunting. The presentation is highly similar to the previously described TEMPI syndrome, though calls into question the potential importance of the monoclonal gammopathy. Our patient demonstrated a response to treatment with hydroxyurea, while patients with the TEMPI syndrome have shown responses to plasma-cell directed therapies such as bortezomib.",

Superficial hand infections are located superficial to the tendons and are comprised of cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp-space infections, herpetic whitlow, and include volar as well as dorsal subcutaneous abscesses. Deep hand infections are located deep to the tendon sheaths and include synovial space infections, such as infectious tenosynovitis, deep fascial space infections, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, and osteomyelitis. Knowledge of hand and wrist compartmental anatomy is essential for the accurate diagnosis and management of hand infections. Although early and superficial infections of the hand may respond to non-surgical management, most hand infections are surgical emergencies.

As herpetic whitlow is not seen often, it may go under-recognised or be mistaken for a different kind of infection of the finger. Delayed recognition and/or treatment puts patients at risk of complications ranging from superinfection to herpetic encephalitis. A 23-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was referred by his primary care physician because of erythema and swelling of the little finger of his left hand. The primary care physician had already treated him with the oral antibiotic Augmentin\u00ae (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) and incision of the finger, but this had not resolved his complaints. He had multiple vesicles on the finger, which led to the diagnosis of herpetic whitlow, which we confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing. All cutaneous abnormalities disappeared after treatment. Whitlow is rarely caused by the herpes simplex virus, but this disease requires a swift recognition and treatment to prevent complications. This case serves to emphasise that not all whitlow is caused by a bacterial infection, and that it is important to differentiate between herpetic and bacterial whitlow, as these diseases require a different treatment.",

Treatment with acyclovir at thirteen months after presentation led to a complete resolution of her symptoms with no further recurrences to date. This rare case highlights the similarity in presentation between flexor sheath infection and herpetic whitlow which can lead to diagnostic confusion and mismanagement.

The goal of this review is to highlight the latest advances in CF multidisciplinary care, together with the recent updates to the 2017 CF Foundation diagnostic guidelines. Data from newborn screening programs, patient registries, clinical databases, and functional research have led to a better understanding of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene.

Sweat was induced on both forearms of 10 individuals with CF and 10 healthy subjects using pilocarpine iontophoresis. A Macroduct sweat collection device was attached to one arm and sweat was collected for 30 min and then sent for laboratory analysis. A sensor was attached to the other arm and the chloride ion concentration monitored in real time for 30 min using a Bluetooth transceiver and smart phone app. Stable sweat chloride measurements were obtained within 15 min following sweat induction using the wearable sensor. We define the detection time as the time at which the standard deviation of the real-time chloride ion concentration remained below 2 mEq/L for 5 min. The sweat volume for sensor measurements at the detection time was 13.1 \u00b1 11.4 \u03bcL (SD), in many cases lower than the minimum sweat volume of 15 \u03bcL for conventional testing. The mean difference between sweat chloride concentrations measured by the sensor and the conventional laboratory practice was 6.2 \u00b1 9.5 mEq/L (SD), close to the arm-to-arm variation of about 3 mEq/L.

This is because newborn screening started relatively recently, it is not performed everywhere, and even for individuals who were screened, there is the possibility of a false negative. To limit irreversible organ pathology, a timely diagnosis of CF and institution of CF therapies can greatly benefit these patients. Experts on CF diagnosis were convened at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference. The participants reviewed and discussed published works and instructive cases of CF diagnosis in individuals presenting with signs, symptoms, or a family history of CF. Through a modified Delphi methodology, several consensus statements were agreed upon. These consensus statements were updates of prior CF diagnosis conferences and recommendations. CF diagnosis in individuals outside of newborn screening relies on the clinical evidence and on evidence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. Clinical evidence can include typical organ pathologies seen in CF such as bronchiectasis or pancreatic insufficiency but often represent a broad range of severity including mild cases. CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests. On the basis of the large number of patients with bona fide CF currently followed in registries with sweat chloride levels between 30 and 40 mmol/L, the threshold considered \"intermediate\" was lowered from 40 mmol/L in the prior diagnostic guidelines to 30 mmol/L. The CF diagnosis was also discussed in the context of CFTR-related disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may be present, but the individual does not meet criteria for CF. CF diagnosis remains a rare but important condition that can be diagnosed when characteristic clinical features are seen in an individual with demonstrated CFTR dysfunction.",

Fifty-one (16.2%) patients had two mutations identified. Among them 32 had positive sweat chloride levels (\u226560 mmol/L), while seven had borderline sweat chloride levels (40-59 mmol/L). An additional 70 patients (22.3%) had only one mutation identified. Among them eight had positive sweat chloride levels, and 17 had borderline sweat chloride levels. Fifty-five patients (17.5%) without CFTR mutations had either borderline (n=45) or positive (n=10) sweat chloride results. Three patients with a CF phenotype had negative CFTR analysis but elevated sweat chloride levels. In eighty-three patients (26.4%) CFTR mutational analysis was done without corresponding sweat chloride testing. Although CFTR mutation analysis has improved the diagnostic capability for CF, its use either as the first step or the only test to diagnose CFTR dysfunction should be discouraged and CF diagnostic guidelines need to be followed.",

However, it provides ambiguous results for intermediate sweat chloride cases while not reflecting disease progression when classifying the complex CF disease spectrum given the pleiotropic effects of gene modifiers and environment. Herein we report the first characterization of the sweat metabolome from screen-positive CF infants and identify metabolites associated with disease status that complement sweat chloride testing. Pilocarpine-stimulated sweat specimens were collected independently from two CF clinics, including 50 unaffected infants (e.g., carriers) and 18 confirmed CF cases. Nontargeted metabolite profiling was performed using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry as a high throughput platform for analysis of polar/ionic metabolites in volume-restricted sweat samples. Amino acids, organic acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, purine derivatives, and unknown exogenous compounds were identified in sweat when using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including metabolites associated with affected yet asymptomatic CF infants, such as asparagine and glutamine. Unexpectedly, a metabolite of pilocarpine, used to stimulate sweat secretion, pilocarpic acid, and a plasticizer metabolite from environmental exposure, mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalic acid, were secreted in the sweat of CF infants at significantly lower concentrations relative to unaffected CF screen-positive controls. These results indicated a deficiency in human paraoxonase, an enzyme unrelated to mutations to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and impaired chloride transport, which is a nonspecific arylesterase/lactonase known to mediate inflammation, bacterial biofilm formation, and recurrent lung infections in affected CF children later in life. This work sheds new light into the underlying mechanisms of CF pathophysiology as required for new advances in precision medicine of orphan diseases that benefit from early detection and intervention, including new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Retrospective survey and descriptive analysis of 5,721 ST at a university referral center. The inclusion of the subjects was based on clinical data related with cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype. The samples were grouped by (i) sweat chloride concentrations (mEq/L): &lt;30: 3,249/5,277 (61.6%); \u226530 to &lt;60: 1,326/5,277 (25.1%); \u226560: 702/5,277 (13.3%) and (ii) age: (Group A--GA) 0 to &lt;6 months; (Group B--GB) \u22656 months to &lt;18 years; (Group C--GC) \u226518 years. Digestive symptoms showed higher prevalence ratio for the CF diagnosis as well as association between younger age and higher values of sweat chloride, sweat sodium, and chloride/sodium ratio. The indication of ST due to respiratory symptoms was higher in GB and associated with greater age, lower values of sweat chloride, sweat sodium, and chloride/sodium ratio. There was higher prevalence of ST with sweat chloride levels &lt;30 mEq/L in GB, \u226560 mEq/L in GC, and with borderline level in GB. There was positive correlation between sweat sodium and sweat chloride. Sweat chloride/sweat sodium and sweat sodium-sweat chloride indexes showed association with sex, reason for ST indication, and <i>CFTR</i> mutations. Sex alters some values presented in the ST. The number of ST/year performed before and after the newborn screening implementation was the same; however, we observed a higher number of borderlines values. A wide spectrum of <i>CFTR</i> mutation was found. Severe <i>CFTR</i> mutations and F508del/F508del genotype were associated with highest probability of ST chloride levels \u226560 mEq/L, and the absence of <i>CFTR</i> mutations identified was associated with borderline ST and respiratory symptoms. ST data showed wide variability dependent on age, sex, reason for examination indication, <i>CFTR</i> mutations, and weight of the collected sweat sample. Sweat sodium concentration is directly correlated with sweat chloride levels and it could be used as a quality parameter.",

The distinguishable salty character of the sweat belonging to individuals suffering from CF makes sweat chloride estimation essential for diagnosis of CF disease. The aim of this prospective study was to elucidate the relationship of sweat chloride levels with clinical features and pattern of CF. A total of 182 patients, with clinical features of CF were included in this study for quantitative measurement of sweat chloride. Sweat stimulation and collection involved pilocarpine iontophoresis based on the Gibson and Cooks methodology. The quantitative estimation of chloride was done by Schales and Schales method with some modifications. Cystic Fibrosis Trans Membrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutation status was recorded in case of patients with borderline sweat chloride levels to correlate the results and for follow-up. Out of 182 patients having clinical features consistent with CF, borderline and elevated sweat chloride levels were present in 9 (5%) and 41 (22.5%) subjects respectively. Elevated sweat chloride levels were significantly associated with wheeze, Failure To Thrive (FTT), history of CF in Siblings, product of Consanguineous Marriage (CM), digital clubbing and steatorrhoea on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis only wheeze, FTT and steatorrhoea were found to be significantly associated with elevated sweat chloride levels (p&lt;0.05). Among the nine borderline cases six cases were positive for at least two CFTR mutations and rest of the three cases were not having any mutation in CFTR gene. The diagnosis is often delayed and the disease is advanced in most patients at the time of diagnosis. Sweat testing is a gold standard for diagnosis of CF patients as genetic mutation profile being heterozygous and unlikely to become diagnostic test.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15274098": "In cystic fibrosis (CF), sweat chloride concentration has been proposed as an index of CFTR function for testing systemic drugs designed to activate mutant CFTR. This suggestion arises from the assumption that greater residual CFTR function should lead to a lower sweat chloride concentration, as well as protection against severe lung disease. This logic gives rise to the hypothesis that the lower the sweat chloride concentration, the less severe the lung disease. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied 230 patients homozygous for the DeltaF508 allele, and 34 patients with at least one allele associated with pancreatic sufficiency, born since January 1, 1955, who have pulmonary function data and sweat chloride concentrations recorded in our CF center database, and no culture positive for B. cepacia. We calculated a severity index for pulmonary disease, using an approach which takes into account all available pulmonary function data as well as the patient's current age and survival status. Patients with alleles associated with pancreatic sufficiency had significantly better survival (P = 0.0083), lower sweat chloride concentration (81.4 +/- 23.8 vs. 103.2 +/- 14.2 mEq/l, P &lt; 0.0001), slower rate of decline of FEV(1) % predicted (-0.75 +/- 0.34 vs. -2.34 +/- 0.17% predicted per year), and a better severity index than patients homozygous for the DeltaF508 allele (median 73rd percentile vs. median 55th percentile, P = 0.0004). However, the sweat chloride concentration did not correlate with the severity index, either in the population as a whole, or in the population of patients with alleles associated with pancreatic sufficiency, who are thought to have some residual CFTR function. These data suggest that, by itself, sweat chloride concentration does not necessarily predict a milder pulmonary course in patients with cystic fibrosis.",

Our objectives were to: 1) describe variables that determine sweat rate; 2) determine the analytic and diagnostic capacity of sweat chloride analysis across the range of observed sweat rates; and 3) determine the biologic variability of sweat chloride concentration. A retrospective analysis was performed using data from all sweat chloride tests performed at St. Louis Children's Hospital over a 21-month period. A total of 1397 sweat chloride tests (1155 sufficient [\u226575 mg], 242 insufficient [&lt;75 mg]), were performed on 904 individuals. The sweat weight collected from forearms was statistically greater than that collected from legs. There was a negligible correlation between sweat weight and chloride concentration (r=-0.06). The mean individual biologic CV calculated from individuals with two or more sweat collections \u226575 mg was 13.1% (95% CI: 11.3-14.9%; range 0-88%) yielding a reference change value of 36%. Using 60 mmol/L as the diagnostic chloride cutoff, 100% of CF cases were detected whether a minimum sweat weight of 75, 40, or 20 mg was required. 1) Collection of sweat from forearms is preferable to upper legs, particularly in very young infants; 2) sweat chloride concentrations are not highly dependent upon sweat rate; 3) a change in sweat chloride concentration exceeding 36% may be considered a clinically significant response to cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor targeted therapy, and 4) sweat collections of less than 75 mg provide clinically accurate information.",

Sweat chloride (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis) and sweat conductivity tests were simultaneously performed in patients referred for a sweat test between March 2007 and October 2008. Conductivity and chloride cut-off values used to rule out or diagnose CF were &lt;75 and \u226590 mmol/L and &lt;60 and \u226560 mmol/L, respectively. The ROC curve method was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), as well as the respective 95% confidence intervals and to calculate the area under the curve for both tests. The kappa coefficient was used to evaluate agreement between the tests. Both tests were performed in 738 children, and CF was ruled out in 714 subjects; the median sweat chloride and conductivity values were 11 and 25 mmol/L in these populations, respectively. Twenty-four patients who had received a diagnosis of CF presented median sweat chloride and conductivity values of 87 and 103 mmol/L, respectively. Conductivity values above 90 mmol/L had 83.3% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity, 90.9% PPV and 99.4% NPV to diagnose CF. The best conductivity cut-off value to exclude CF was &lt;75 mmol/L. Good agreement was observed between the tests (kappa: 0.934). The sweat conductivity test yielded a high degree of diagnostic accuracy and it showed good agreement with sweat chloride.

It is quite common in Caucasians, but very rare in Asians. Sweat chloride test is known to be a screening test for the cystic fibrosis due to the fact that electrolyte levels in sweat are elevated in patients. In this study, sweat chloride levels in Korean population were measured and analyzed by using standardized pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride test. The sweat chloride test was performed in 47 patients referred to Yondong Severance Hospital from August, 2001 to April, 2007 and 41 healthy volunteers. The sweat chloride tests were conducted according to the CLSI C34-A2 guideline using pilocarpine iontophoresis method, and the chloride concentrations in sweat were measured by mercurimetric titration. Four patients showed sweat chloride concentrations higher than 60 mmol/L. Reference interval was calculated as 1.4-44.5 mmol/L by analysis of the results of healthy volunteers (n=41). Four patients who exhibited high sweat chloride levels, had characteristic clinical features of cystic fibrosis and their diagnoses were confirmed either by repeated sweat chloride test or genetic analysis. Standardized sweat chloride test can be utilized as a useful diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis in Koreans. In cases of sweat chloride levels higher than 40 mmol/L, the test should be repeated for the possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. All the confirmed Korean cases of cystic fibrosis showed sweat chloride level above 60 mmol/L.",

Hence, ruling out Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in these patients is often required. In the past, the value of sweat testing - the gold standard to diagnose CF - has been questioned in DS as false positive results have been reported. However, these reports are based on measurements of sweat osmolality or sodium concentrations, not chloride concentrations. This study analyses sweat secretion rate and chloride concentration in sweat samples of patients with DS in comparison to healthy controls. We assessed sweat samples in 16 patients with DS and 16 healthy controls regarding sweat secretion rate (SSR) and sweat chloride concentration. All measured chloride concentrations were within the normal range. The chloride concentrations were slightly, but not significantly lower in patients with DS (15,54 mmol/l (\u00b14,47)) compared to healthy controls (18,31 mmol/l (\u00b110,12)). While no gender gap in chloride concentration could be found, chloride concentration increased with age in both groups. Insufficient sweat was collected in 2 females with DS (12.5% of the study group) but not in an individual of the control group. A significant lower sweat secretion rate was found in the DS group (27,6 \u03bcl/30 min (\u00b1 12,18)) compared to the control group (42,7 \u03bcl/30 min (\u00b1 21,22)). In a sub-analysis, female patients produced significantly less sweat (20,8 \u00b1 10,6 \u03bcl/30 min) than male patients with DS (36,4 \u00b1 7,8 \u03bcl/30 min), which accounts for the difference between patients and controls. Furthermore, while the sweating secretion rate increased with age in the control group, it did not do so in the DS group. Once again this was due to female patients with DS, who did not show a significant increase of sweat secretion rate with age. Sweat chloride concentrations were within the normal range in patients with DS and therefore seem to be a reliable tool for testing for CF in these patients. Interestingly, we found a reduced sweat secretion rate in the DS group. Whether the last one has a functional and clinical counterpart, possibly due to a disturbed thermoregulation in DS patients, requires further investigation.",

Cutoff values of \u226560 mmol/L of chloride concentration for the classic sweat test was considered for diagnosis of CF. In crystallization method, observation of typical dendritic forms of salt crystals under light microscopy was interpreted positive. Sixty patients suspected to CF (31 males and 29 females) with age range of 9 months to 2 years underwent the sweat test using both techniques. Median sweat chloride values was 26.13+10.85 in group with negative and 72.76+12.78 mmol/L in group with positive sweat test, respectively. All the patients who had positive sweat test in classic method showed typical dendritic forms of salt crystal in sweat crystallization test, which provided the test with 100% sensitivity (95%CI: 93.1-100). Only one of the 31 subjects with negative results for classic sweat test had positive result for crystallization sweat test, which provided the test with 96.7% specificity (95%CI: 92.9-100). Time spent to perform the crystallization test was significantly shorter than the classic method whereas its cost was also lower than the second method.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29998471": "Foliar nyctinasty is a plant behaviour characterised by a pronounced daily oscillation in leaf orientation. During the day, the blades of nyctinastic plant leaves (or leaflets) assume a more or less horizontal position that optimises their ability to capture sunlight for photosynthesis. At night, the positions that the leaf blades assume, regardless of whether they arise by rising, falling or twisting, are essentially vertical. Among the ideas put forth to explain the raison d'\u00eatre of foliar nyctinasty are that it: (i) improves the temperature relations of plants; (ii) helps remove surface water from foliage; (iii) prevents the disruption of photoperiodism by moonlight; and (iv) directly discourages insect herbivory. After discussing these previous hypotheses, a novel tritrophic hypothesis is introduced that proposes that foliar nyctinasty constitutes an indirect plant defence against nocturnal herbivores. It is suggested that the reduction in physical clutter that follows from nocturnal leaf closure may increase the foraging success of many types of animals that prey upon or parasitise herbivores. Predators and parasitoids generally use some combination of visual, auditory or olfactory cues to detect prey. In terrestrial environments, it is hypothesised that the vertical orientation of the blades of nyctinastic plants at night would be especially beneficial to flying nocturnal predators (e.g. bats and owls) and parasitoids whose modus operandi is death from above. The movements of prey beneath a plant with vertically oriented foliage would be visually more obvious to gleaning or swooping predators under nocturnal or crepuscular conditions. Such predators could also detect sounds made by prey better without baffling layers of foliage overhead to damp and disperse the signal. Moreover, any volatiles released by the prey would diffuse more directly to the awaiting olfactory apparatus of the predators or parasitoids. In addition to facilitating the demise of herbivores by carnivores and parasitoids, foliar nyctinasty, much like the enhanced illumination of the full moon, may mitigate feeding by nocturnal herbivores by altering their foraging behaviour. Foliar nyctinasty could also provide a competitive advantage by encouraging herbivores, seeking more cover, to forage on or around non-nyctinastic species. As an added advantage, foliar nyctinasty, by decreasing the temperature between plants through its effects on re-radiation, may slow certain types of ectothermic herbivores making them more vulnerable to predation. Foliar nyctinasty also may not solely be a behavioural adaptation against folivores; by discouraging foraging by granivores, the inclusive fitness of nyctinastic plants may be increased.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29983317": "The circadian leaf opening and closing (nyctinasty) of Fabaceae has attracted scientists' attention since the era of Charles Darwin. Nyctinastic movement is triggered by the alternate swelling and shrinking of motor cells at the base of the leaf. This, in turn, is facilitated by changing osmotic pressures brought about by ion flow through anion and potassium ion channels. However, key regulatory ion channels and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we identify three key ion channels in mimosoid tree Samanea saman: the slow-type anion channels, SsSLAH1 and SsSLAH3, and the Shaker-type potassium channel, SPORK2. We show that cell-specific circadian expression of SsSLAH1 plays a key role in nyctinastic leaf opening. In addition, SsSLAH1 co-expressed with SsSLAH3 in flexor (abaxial) motor cells promoted leaf opening. We confirm the importance of SLAH1 in leaf movement using SLAH1-impaired Glycine max.

Treatment with the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, reversed the inhibition of ER stress, secretion of apolipoprotein B, and hepatic lipid accumulation induced by EUE or its component, aucubin or geniposide. In addition, EUE was determined to regulate hepatic dyslipidemia by enhancing lysosomal activity and to regulate ER stress in rats fed a high-fat diet.

The plasma adiponectin/leptin ratio also improved in ELE-treated rats. Although plasma leptin levels were elevated in all HFD rats, adiponectin levels increased only in the ELE-treated rats. Anti-hypertensive and anti-obesity effects may be caused by the geniposidic acid (GEA) and/or asperuloside present in ELE.

Eighty rats were studied for 3 months in ten groups. Both forms of Eucommia leaves minimised increases in body weight and visceral fat in a dose-dependent fashion. Increases in plasma levels of TAG and NEFA, and insulin resistance secondary to HFD were lessened by both forms of Eucommia leaf. Concomitantly, an increase in plasma adiponectin levels and suppression of plasma resistin and TNF-\u03b1 levels were confirmed. Real-time PCR studies showed that both forms of Eucommia leaf enhanced metabolic function across several organs, including diminishing ATP production (white adipose tissue), accelerating \u03b2-oxidation (liver) and increasing the use of ketone bodies/glucose (skeletal muscle), all of which may exert anti-obesity effects under HFD conditions. These findings suggest that chronic administration of either form of Eucommia leaves stimulates the metabolic function in rats across several organs. The anti-obesity and anti-metabolic syndrome activity in this rat model may be maintained through secretion and regulation of adipocytokines that depend on the accumulation of visceral fat to improve insulin resistance or hyperlipaemia.",

However, a wealth of knowledge about the variant biological function/disease impact is buried in unstructured literature data. Previous studies have attempted to harvest and unlock such information with text-mining techniques but are of limited use because their mutation extraction results are not standardized or integrated with curated data. We propose an automatic method to extract and normalize variant mentions to unique identifiers (dbSNP RSIDs). Our method, in benchmarking results, demonstrates a high F-measure of \u223c90% and compared favorably to the state of the art. Next, we applied our approach to the entire PubMed and validated the results by verifying that each extracted variant-gene pair matched the dbSNP annotation based on mapped genomic position, and by analyzing variants curated in ClinVar. We then determined which text-mined variants and genes constituted novel discoveries. Our analysis reveals 41 889 RS numbers (associated with 9151 genes) not found in ClinVar. Moreover, we obtained a rich set worth further review: 12 462 rare variants (MAF \u2264 0.01) in 3849 genes which are presumed to be deleterious and not frequently found in the general population. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to analyze and integrate text-mined variant data with curated knowledge in existing databases. Our results suggest that databases can be significantly enriched by text mining and that the combined information can greatly assist human efforts in evaluating/prioritizing variants in genomic research.

Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships between images of read pileups around putative variant and true genotype calls. The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data. We further show that DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, including deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics and Ion Ampliseq exomes, highlighting the benefits of using more automated and generalizable techniques for variant calling.",

Recently, we found that Stamp2 has a critical role in the integration of inflammatory and metabolic signals in adipose tissue where it is highly expressed and regulated by nutritional and metabolic cues. In this study, we show that all Stamp family members are differentially regulated during adipogenesis: whereas Stamp1 expression is significantly decreased upon differentiation, Stamp2 expression is increased. In contrast, Stamp3 expression is modestly changed in adipocytes compared to preadipocytes, and has a biphasic expression pattern during the course of differentiation. Suppression of Stamp1 or Stamp2 expression both led to inhibition of 3T3-L1 differentiation in concert with diminished expression of the key regulators of adipogenesis - CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/ebp\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Ppar\u03b3). Upon Stamp1 knockdown, mitotic clonal expansion was also inhibited. In contrast, Stamp2 knockdown did not affect mitotic clonal expansion, but resulted in a marked decrease in superoxide production that is known to affect adipogenesis. These results suggest that Stamp1 and Stamp2 play critical roles in adipogenesis, but through different mechanisms.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17482547": "Metabolic and inflammatory pathways crosstalk at many levels, and, while required for homeostasis, interaction between these pathways can also lead to metabolic dysregulation under conditions of chronic stress. Thus, we hypothesized that mechanisms might exist to prevent overt inflammatory responses during physiological fluctuations in nutrients or under nutrient-rich conditions, and we identified the six-transmembrane protein STAMP2 as a critical modulator of this integrated response system of inflammation and metabolism in adipocytes. Lack of STAMP2 in adipocytes results in aberrant inflammatory responses to both nutrients and acute inflammatory stimuli. Similarly, in whole animals, visceral adipose tissue of STAMP2(-/-) mice exhibits overt inflammation, and these mice develop spontaneous metabolic disease on a regular diet, manifesting insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, mild hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease. We conclude that STAMP2 participates in integrating inflammatory and metabolic responses and thus plays a key role in systemic metabolic homeostasis.",

Our hypothesis was that STAMP2 could be involved in human obesity and insulin resistance. The objective of the study was to elucidate the role of adipose STAMP2 expression in human obesity and insulin resistance. The design was to quantify STAMP2 in human abdominal sc and omental white adipose tissue (WAT), isolated adipocytes, and stroma and in vitro differentiated preadipocytes and relate levels of STAMP2 in sc WAT to clinical and adipocyte phenotypes involved in insulin resistance. Nonobese and obese women and men (n = 236) recruited from an obesity clinic or through local advertisement. Clinical measures included body mass index, body fat, total adiponectin, and homeostasis model assessment as measure of overall insulin resistance. In adipocytes we determined cell size, sensitivity of lipolysis and lipogenesis to insulin, adiponectin secretion, and inflammatory gene expression. STAMP2 levels in sc and visceral WAT and adipocytes were increased in obesity (P = 0.0008-0.05) but not influenced by weight loss. Increased WAT STAMP2 levels associated with a high amount of body fat (P = 0.04), high homeostasis model assessment (P = 0.01), and large adipocytes (P = 0.02). Subjects with high STAMP2 levels displayed reduced sensitivity of adipocyte lipogenesis (P = 0.04) and lipolysis (P = 0.03) to insulin but had normal adiponectin levels. WAT STAMP2 levels correlated with expression of the macrophage marker CD68 (P = 0.0006). Human WAT STAMP2 associates with obesity and insulin resistance independently of adiponectin, but the role of STAMP2 in obesity and its complications seems different from that in mice.",

STAMP2 has unique anti-inflammatory and pro-metabolic properties in mouse adipose tissue, but there is limited information on its role in human metabolic tissues. Using human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), we report that STAMP2 expression is dramatically upregulated during adipogenesis. shRNA-mediated STAMP2 knockdown in ASCs significantly suppresses adipogenesis and interferes with optimal expression of adipogenic genes and adipocyte metabolic function. Furthermore, ASC-derived adipocyte-mediated stimulation of prostate tumor growth in nude mice is significantly reduced upon STAMP2 knockdown in ASC adipocytes.

Absence of Stamp2 results in significant increases in cellular NADPH levels, and both NADPH homeostasis and the exaggerated inflammatory response of Stamp2(-/-) macrophages are rescued by exogenous wild-type but not by a reductase-deficient Stamp2 molecule. Chemical and genetic suppression of NADPH production in Stamp2(-/-) macrophages reverts the heightened inflammatory response. Stamp2 is detected in mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques, and its deficiency promotes atherosclerosis in mice. Furthermore, bone marrow transplantation experiments demonstrated that Stamp2 in myeloid cells is sufficient to protect against atherosclerosis.

However, there have been contradictory reports in humans. We aimed to explore STAMP2 in association with inflammatory and metabolic status of human obesity. STAMP2 gene expression was analyzed in adipose tissue samples (171 visceral and 67 sc depots) and during human preadipocyte differentiation. Human adipocytes were treated with macrophage-conditioned medium, TNF-\u03b1, and rosiglitazone. In visceral adipose tissue, STAMP2 gene expression was significantly decreased in obese subjects, mainly in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. STAMP2 gene expression and protein were significantly and inversely associated with obesity phenotype measures (body mass index, waist, hip, and fat mass) and obesity-associated metabolic disturbances (systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose). In addition, STAMP2 gene expression was positively associated with lipogenic (FASN, ACC1, SREBP1, THRSP14, TR\u03b1, and TR\u03b11), CAV1, IRS1, GLUT4, and CD206 gene expression. In sc adipose tissue, STAMP2 gene expression was not associated with metabolic parameters. In both fat depots, STAMP2 gene expression in stromovascular cells was significantly higher than in mature adipocytes. STAMP2 gene expression was significantly increased during the differentiation process in parallel to adipogenic genes, being increased in preadipocytes derived from lean subjects. Macrophage-conditioned medium (25%) and TNF-\u03b1 (100 ng/ml) administration increased whereas rosiglitazone (2 \u03bcM) decreased significantly STAMP2 gene expression in human differentiated adipocytes.

TIARP/STAMP2 mRNA synthesis was significantly stimulated by IL-1beta in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Signaling studies suggested that janus kinase 2, nuclear factor kappaB, and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase are involved in IL-1beta-induced TIARP/STAMP2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and IL-6 showed synergistic stimulatory effects on TIARP/STAMP2 gene expression. Moreover, both TIARP/STAMP2 mRNA synthesis and protein expression were induced by IL-1beta in fully differentiated human mesenchymal stem cell-derived adipocytes (hMSC-Ad). Taken together, TIARP/STAMP2 is highly upregulated in 3T3-L1 cells and hMSC-Ad by IL-1beta and might, therefore, modulate proinflammatory and insulin resistance-inducing effects of IL-1beta.",

As such, it has been considered as a relevant target in disorders as varied as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, neuropathic pain and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A range of competitive antagonists/inverse agonists have progressed into clinical development, with pitolisant approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. Given the breadth of compounds developed and potential therapeutic indications, we assessed the comparative pharmacology of six investigational histamine H<sub>3</sub> agents, including pitolisant, using native tissue and recombinant cells. Whilst all of the compounds tested displayed robust histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor inverse agonism and did not differentiate between the main H<sub>3</sub> receptor splice variants, they displayed a wide range of affinities and kinetic properties, and included rapidly dissociating (pitolisant, S 38093-2, ABT-239) and slowly dissociating (GSK189254, JNJ-5207852, PF-3654746) agents. S 38093-2 had the lowest histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor affinity (pK<sub>B</sub> values 5.7-6.2), seemingly at odds with previously reported, potent in vivo activity in models of cognition. We show here that at pro-cognitive and anti-hyperalgesic/anti-allodynic doses, S 38093-2 preferentially occupies the mouse sigma-1 receptor in vivo, only engaging the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor at doses associated with wakefulness promotion and neurotransmitter (histamine, ACh) release. Furthermore, pitolisant, ABT-239 and PF-3654746 also displayed appreciable sigma-1 receptor affinity, suggesting that this property differentiates clinically evaluated histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists and may play a role in their efficacy.",

Therefore, we studied the influence of pitolisant on body weight, water and sucrose intake as well as metabolic disturbances in the high-fat and high-sugar diet-induced obesity model in mice. To induce obesity, male CD-1 mice were fed a high-fat diet consisting of 40% fat blend for 14 weeks, water and 30% sucrose solution available ad libitum. Glucose tolerance test was performed at the beginning of week 15. Insulin tolerance was tested the day after. At the end of study, plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterol were determined. Pitolisant at dose of 10 mg/kg bw (ip) was administrated during 14 days, starting from the beginning of week 13. Metformin at dose of 100 mg/kg bw (ip) was used as reference drug. Mice fed with high-fat diet and sucrose solution showed more weight gain throughout the 12-week period of inducing obesity. Animals fed with high-fat diet and treated with pitolisant (for the next 14 days) showed significantly less weight gain than mice from the control group consuming a high-fat feed. In the group treated with pitolisant, glucose levels were significantly lower than glucose levels of control obese mice after glucose load. The plasma triglyceride levels in pitolisant-treated mice were significantly lower compared with those in control obese group. In conclusion, pitolisant has a favorable influence of body weight and improves glucose tolerance and the lipid profile in obese mice.",

Although only a few drugs have received regulatory approval for narcolepsy to date, treatment involves diverse medications that affect multiple biochemical targets and neural circuits. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the following classes of drugs as narcolepsy treatments: alerting medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol [JZP-110]), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), sodium oxybate, and the H<sub>3</sub>-receptor inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant. Enhanced catecholamine availability and regulation of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neuron activity is likely central to the therapeutic activity of most of these compounds. LC NE neurons are integral to sleep/wake regulation and muscle tone; reduced excitatory input to the LC due to compromise of Hcrt/orexin neurons (likely due to autoimmune factors) results in LC NE dysregulation and contributes to narcolepsy/cataplexy symptoms. Agents that increase catecholamines and/or LC activity may mitigate EDS and cataplexy by elevating NE regulation of GABAergic inputs from the amygdala. Consequently, novel medications and treatment strategies aimed at preserving and/or modulating Hcrt/orexin-LC circuit integrity are warranted in narcolepsy/cataplexy.",

In contrast to the other histamine receptor subtypes (H<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>4</sub>), the H<sub>3</sub> receptor is located presynaptically and shows a constitutive activity. In detail, H<sub>3</sub> receptors are involved in the inhibition of histamine release (presynaptic autoreceptor), impulse flow along the histaminergic neurones (somadendritic autoreceptor) and histamine synthesis. Moreover, they occur as inhibitory presynaptic heteroreceptors on serotoninergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic and perhaps cholinergic neurones. This review shows for four functions of the brain that the H<sub>3</sub> receptor represents a brake against the wake-promoting, anticonvulsant and anorectic effect of histamine (via postsynaptic H<sub>1</sub> receptors) and its procognitive activity (via postsynaptic H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> receptors). Indeed, H<sub>1</sub> agonists and H<sub>3</sub> inverse agonists elicit essentially the same effects, at least in rodents; these effects are opposite in direction to those elicited by brain-penetrating H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists in humans. Although the benefit for H<sub>3</sub> inverse agonists for the symptomatic treatment of dementias is inconclusive, several members of this group have shown a marked potential for the treatment of disorders associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.

Therefore, the effects of histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonist E159 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) in adult male rats on dizocilpine (DIZ)-induced memory deficits were studied in passive avoidance paradigm (PAP) and in novel object recognition (NOR) using pitolisant (PIT) and donepezil (DOZ) as standard drugs. Upon acute systemic pretreatment of E159 at three different doses, namely 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p., 2.5 and 5 but not 10 mg/kg of E159 counteracted the DIZ (0.1 mg)-induced memory deficits, and this E159 (2.5 mg)-elicited memory-improving effects in DIZ-induced amnesic model were moderately abrogated after acute systemic administration of scopolamine (SCO), H2R antagonist zolantidine (ZOL), but not with H1R antagonist pyrilamine to the animals. Moreover, the observed memory-enhancing effects of E159 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) were strongly abrogated when animals were administered with a combination of SCO and ZOL. Furthermore, the E159 (2.5 mg)-provided significant memory-improving effect of in DIZ-induced short-term memory (STM) impairment in NOR was comparable to the DOZ-provided memory-enhancing effect, and was abolished when animals were injected with the CNS-penetrant histamine H3R agonist <i>R</i>-(\u03b1)-methylhistamine (RAMH). However, E159 at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg failed to exhibit procognitive effect on DIZ-induced long-term memory (LTM) in NOR. Furthermore, the results observed revealed that E159 (2.5 mg/kg) did not alter anxiety levels and locomotor activity of animals naive to elevated-plus maze (EPM), demonstrating that improved performances with E159 (2.5 mg/kg) in PAP or NOR are unrelated to changes in emotional responding or in spontaneous locomotor activity.

However, these potentiating effects of thioperamide do not necessarily result from H3 receptor blockade since thioperamide is an imidazole-based compound capable of enhancing plasma cocaine concentrations by blocking cytochrome P450 activity. In contrast, Pitolisant is a non-imidazole H3 receptor inverse agonist that has already been tested in clinical trials but it remains to be determined whether this compound also potentiates the behavioral effects of cocaine. The present study tested the effects of Pitolisant on locomotion, on cocaine-induced hyperactivity and on the development of conditioned place preference induced by cocaine (2 and 8mg/kg, i.p.) in male C57BL/6J mice. Pitolisant was injected 30min before each cocaine-pairing session. Locomotion recorded on the first cocaine-pairing session was used to test the effects of Pitolisant on the locomotor effects of cocaine. Our results show that doses of Pitolisant higher than 10mg/kg depressed locomotion. When injected alone at doses that did not affect locomotion, Pitolisant (2.5-10mg/kg, i.p.) had no rewarding properties in the place conditioning technique.

Six severe adverse events were treatment-related: one with pitolisant (abdominal discomfort) and five with modafinil (abdominal pain, abnormal behaviour, amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms, lymphoadenopathy, and inner ear disorders). Pitolisant at doses up to 40 mg was efficacious on EDS compared with placebo and well tolerated compared with modafinil. If these findings are substantiated in further studies, pitolisant could offer a new treatment option for patients with narcolepsy. Bioprojet, France.",

Pitolisant (BF2.649, 1-{3-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)propoxy]propyl}piperidine, hydrochloride) was the first H3R inverse agonist that has been tested in human trials and is well tolerated. The present study investigated whether Pitolisant (0.625-20mg/kg, i.p.) improves consolidation and reconsolidation processes in the fear conditioning task in female C57BL/6J mice. We also tested whether Pitolisant reverses memory deficits induced by the non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801). Our results indicate that post-training systemic injections of Pitolisant facilitated consolidation of contextual fear memory and reversed amnesia induced by an i.p. injection of 0.12 mg/kg dizocilpine. In addition, none of the doses of Pitolisant we have tested after reactivation (reexposure to the context in which training took place 48 h earlier) affected reconsolidation, whereas dizocilpine disrupted it. However, Pitolisant was able to reverse the deficit in reconsolidation induced by 0.12 mg/kg dizocilpine. The present results are the first demonstration that Pitolisant is effective in improving consolidation processes in the fear condition task and add further evidence to its potential for treating cognitive disorders.",

Since H(3)-ligands can decrease inflammatory pain, we tested Pitolisant in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. MATERIALS AND TREATMENTS: Behavioral effects of pitolisant and the structural different H(3) receptor inverse agonists ciproxifan and ST-889 were tested in zymosan-induced inflammation and the spared nerve injury model for neuropathic pain. Responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli were determined. Calcium imaging was performed with primary neuronal cultures of dorsal root ganglions. Clinically relevant doses of pitolisant (10 mg/kg) had no relevant effect on mechanical or thermal pain thresholds in all animal models. Higher doses (50 mg/kg) dramatically increased thermal but not mechanical pain thresholds. Neither ciproxifan nor ST-889 altered thermal pain thresholds. In peripheral sensory neurons high concentrations of pitolisant (30-500 \u03bcM), but not ciproxifan, partially inhibited calcium increases induced by capsaicin, a selective activator of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1). High doses of pitolisant induced a strong hypothermia. The data show a dramatic effect of high dosages of pitolisant on the thermosensory system, which appears to be H(3) receptor-independent.",

Its drug abuse potential was investigated using in vivo models in rodents and monkeys and compared with those of Modafinil, a psychostimulant currently used in the same indications. Effects of Pitolisant on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, on spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotion, locomotor sensitization were monitored. It was also tested in three standard drug abuse tests i.e. conditioned place preference in rats, self-administration in monkeys and cocaine discrimination in mice as well as in a physical dependence model. Pitolisant did not elicit any significant changes in dopaminergic indices in rat nucleus accumbens whereas Modafinil increased dopamine release. In rodents, Pitolisant was without any effect on locomotion and reduced the cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion. In addition, no locomotor sensitization and no conditioned hyperlocomotion were evidenced with this compound in rats whereas significant effects were elicited by Modafinil. Finally, Pitolisant was devoid of any significant effects in the three standard drug abuse tests (including self-administration in monkeys) and in the physical dependence model. No potential drug abuse liability for Pitolisant was evidenced in various in vivo rodent and primate models, whereas the same does not seem so clear in the case of Modafinil.",

We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant, a histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist, for treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. For this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 16 sleep centres in nine countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine). Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy according to version two of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria, experienced at least three cataplexies per week, and had excessive daytime sleepiness (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score \u226512). We used a computer-generated sequence via an interactive web response system to randomly assign patients to receive either pitolisant or placebo once per day (1:1 ratio). Randomisation was done in blocks of four. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Treatment lasted for 7 weeks: 3 weeks of flexible dosing decided by investigators according to efficacy and tolerance (5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg oral pitolisant), followed by 4 weeks of stable dosing (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg). The primary endpoint was the change in the average number of cataplexy attacks per week as recorded in patient diaries (weekly cataplexy rate [WCR]) between the 2 weeks of baseline and the 4 weeks of stable dosing period. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01800045\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01800045</a>. The trial was done between April 19, 2013, and Jan 28, 2015. We screened 117 patients, 106 of whom were randomly assigned to treatment (54 to pitolisant and 52 to placebo) and, after dropout, 54 patients from the pitolisant group and 51 from the placebo group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The WCR during the stable dosing period compared with baseline was decreased by 75% (WCR<sub>final</sub>=2\u00b727; WCR<sub>baseline</sub>=9\u00b715; WCR<sub>final/baseline</sub>=0\u00b725) in patients who received pitolisant and 38% (WCR<sub>final</sub>=4\u00b752; WCR<sub>baseline</sub>=7\u00b731; WCR<sub>final/baseline</sub>=0\u00b762) in patients who received placebo (rate ratio 0\u00b7512; 95% CI 0\u00b743-0\u00b760, p&lt;0\u00b70001). Treatment-related adverse events were significantly more common in the pitolisant group than in the placebo group (15 [28%] of 54 vs 6 [12%] of 51; p=0\u00b7048). There were no serious adverse events, but one case of severe nausea in the pitolisant group. The most frequent adverse events in the pitolisant group (headache, irritability, anxiety, and nausea) were mild or moderate except one case of severe nausea. No withdrawal syndrome was detected following pitolisant treatment; one case was detected in the placebo group. Pitolisant was well tolerated and efficacious in reducing cataplexy.

Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) activation is a mediator of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the second generation FAK inhibitor VS-6063 on docetaxel efficacy in pre-clinical CRPC and CSPC models. Docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells, mice with PC3 xenografts, and ex vivo cultures of patient-derived primary prostate tumors were treated with VS-6063 and/or docetaxel, or vehicle control. Cell counting, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to evaluate the treatment effects. Docetaxel and VS-6063 co-treatment caused a greater decrease in the viability of docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells, and a greater inhibition in PC3 xenograft growth compared to either monotherapy. FAK expression in human primary prostate cancer was positively associated with advanced tumor stage. Patient-derived prostate tumor explants cultured with both docetaxel and VS-6063 displayed a higher percentage of apoptosis in cancer cells, than monotherapy treatment. Our findings suggest that co-administration of the FAK inhibitor, VS-6063, with docetaxel represents a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.",

In recent years, small-molecule-induced protein degradation has emerged as an orthogonal therapeutic strategy that has the potential to expand the druggable target space. Focal adhesion kinase (Fak) is a key player in tumor invasion and metastasis, acting simultaneously as a kinase and a scaffold for several signaling proteins. While previous efforts to modulate Fak activity were limited to kinase inhibitors with low success in clinical studies, protein degradation offers a possibility to simultaneously block Fak's kinase signaling and scaffolding capabilities. Here, we report the development of a selective and potent Fak degrader, PROTAC-3, which outperforms a clinical candidate, defactinib, with respect to Fak activation as well as Fak-mediated cell migration and invasion. These results underline the potential that PROTACs offer in expanding the druggable space and controlling protein functions that are not easily addressed by traditional small-molecule therapeutics.",

However, recent studies have revealed several oncogenic mutations in SCC patients, including an alteration of the PI3K/AKT pathway, i.e. PI3K point mutations and amplification, AKT mutations and loss or reduced PTEN expression. Prompted by our observation of a correlation between PTEN loss and FAK phosphorylation in a cohort of patients with stage IV SCC, we evaluated the relevance of PTEN loss in cancer progression as well as the efficacy of a new combined treatment with the pan PI3K inhibitor buparlisip and the FAK inhibitor defactinib. An increase in AKT and FAK phosphorylation, associated with increased proliferation and invasiveness, paralleled by the acquisition of mesenchymal markers, and overexpression of the oncomir miR-21 were observed in SKMES-1-derived cell clones with a stable reduction of PTEN. Notably, the combined treatment induced a synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation, and a significant reduction in cell migration and invasion only in cells with reduced PTEN. The molecular mechanisms underlying these findings were unraveled using a specific RTK array that showed a reduction in phosphorylation of key kinases such as JNK, GSK-3 \u03b1/\u03b2, and AMPK-\u03b12, due to the concomitant decrease in AKT and FAK activation. In conclusion, the combination of buparlisib and defactinib was effective against cells with reduced PTEN and warrants further studies as a novel therapeutic strategy for stage IV SCC patients with loss of PTEN expression.",

VS-6063 was administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.) in 21-day cycles to cohorts of three subjects each with a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected on Day 1 and 15. The assessments were performed using CTCAE v4.0 for adverse events (AEs), and the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, version v1.1 (RECIST v1.1) for tumor response. Nine patients were treated across three dose levels (200-600 mg BID). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at any dose level. Most frequent treatment-related AEs were Grade 1/2 unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, fatigue, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Only one subject in the 200 mg BID cohort experienced reversible and transient Grade 3 unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. PK analyses confirmed that the exposure at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 400 mg BID was comparable with exposures previously reported in non-Japanese subjects. Durable stable disease of approximately 24 weeks was confirmed in two subjects (malignant mesothelioma and rectal cancer).

Here we demonstrate an important resistance mechanism initiated from tumor-induced bone. Studies using an osteogenic patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-118b, revealed that tumor cells resistant to cabozantinib, a Met and VEGFR-2 inhibitor, reside in a \"resistance niche\" adjacent to prostate cancer-induced bone. We performed secretome analysis of the conditioned medium from tumor-induced bone to identify proteins (termed \"osteocrines\") found within this resistance niche. In accordance with previous reports demonstrating that activation of integrin signaling pathways confers therapeutic resistance, 27 of the 90 osteocrines identified were integrin ligands. We found that following cabozantinib treatment, only tumor cells positioned adjacent to the newly formed woven bone remained viable and expressed high levels of pFAK-Y397 and pTalin-S425, mediators of integrin signaling. Accordingly, treatment of C4-2B4 cells with integrin ligands resulted in increased pFAK-Y397 expression and cell survival, whereas targeting integrins with FAK inhibitors PF-562271 or defactinib inhibited FAK phosphorylation and reduced the survival of PC3-mm2 cells. Moreover, treatment of MDA-PCa-118b tumors with PF-562271 led to decreased tumor growth, irrespective of initial tumor size. Finally, we show that upon treatment cessation, the combination of PF-562271 and cabozantinib delayed tumor recurrence in contrast to cabozantinib treatment alone. Our studies suggest that identifying paracrine de novo resistance mechanisms may significantly contribute to the generation of a broader set of potent therapeutic tools that act combinatorially to inhibit metastatic prostate cancer.",

DE model was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, i.p.) in ICR mice. CHR was administrated 3 days after STZ treated mice which was confirmed with diabetes for consecutive 6 days. Learning and memory function was tested by Morris water maze after the CHR injection. The morphology of neuronal cells in hippocampus CA3 region was stained by HE-staining. ELISA and Western blot assay were used to determine the levels of pro-inflammation cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) in hippocampus. Here, we demonstrated that mice harboring diabetes mellitus induced by STZ exhibit high blood glucose, learning and memory deficits detected by Morris water maze behavior tests. Application with CHR right after developing diabetes disease rescues partial blood sugar increasing, learning and memory deficits. The data also indicated that the death rate of neurons and the number of astrocytes in hippocampus CA3 region was significantly improved in diabetic mice. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of CHR's protective effect are likely associated with anti-inflammation by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) in hippocampus and inhibiting the over-activation of astrocytes in hippocampus CA3 region.

In the current study, we examined the antitumorigenic activity of chrysophanol in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells, such as ES2 and OVCAR3. Chrysophanol decreased cell viability and increased cell death in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, chrysophanol markedly increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species production in ES2 cells, but only increased it slightly in OVCAR3 cells. Consistent with increased reactive oxygen species production, extensive lipid peroxidation was detected in chrysophanol-treated ES2 cells compared with that in untreated cells, whereas lipid peroxidation was unchanged in OVCAR3 cells in response to chrysophanol. Although there were no significant changes in calcium ions in the of ES2 and OVCAR3 cells, the concentration of calcium in the mitochondria increased dose dependent through disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential in both ES2 and OVCAR3 cells compared with nontreated control cells. Moreover, chrysophanol activated the MAPK signaling pathways in the ovarian cancer cells. In addition, ovarian cancer cell invasiveness was suppressed, which implied that chrysophanol plays a role in preventing ovarian cancer metastasis.

Results of present study, showed that chrysophanol decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis of JEG-3, but not JAR cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Chrysophanol also increased oxidative stress in JEG-3 cells by inducing ROS generation followed by mitochondrial dysfunction including depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Western blot analysis revealed that ERK1/2, P90RSK, AKT, and P70S6K were increased significantly in JEG-3 cells by chrysophanol. Next, we investigated chrysophanol-mediated effects on proliferation of JEG-3 cells using pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/AKT (LY294002) and ERK1/2 (U0126). Inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 prevented chrysophanol-induced stimulation of proliferation of JEG-3 cells. In addition, the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 was suppressed by LY294002 and U0126 in JEG-3 cells treated with chrysophanol, whereas, the AKT protein was activated by pre-treatment of JEG-3 cells with U0126. Furthermore, we compared therapeutic effects of chrysophanol with cisplatin and paclitaxel which are conventional salvage regimens for choriocarcinoma. Our results verified that chrysophanol has synergistic effects with traditional therapy to increase apoptosis of JEG-3 cells.

Recombinant P450 enzyme incubation and microsome inhibition studies demonstrated that P450 1A2 was the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolic activation of chrysophanol and that P450 2B6 and P450 3A4 also participated in the generation of the oxidative metabolites.

With ongoing discussions on the utility of disclosing or searching for such variants, it is of crucial importance to obtain unbiased insight in the prevalence of these incidental or secondary findings, in order to better weigh potential risks and benefits. Previous studies have reported a broad range of secondary findings ranging from 1 to 9%, merely attributable to differences in study design, cohorts tested, sequence technology used and genes analyzed. Here, we analyzed WES data of 1640 anonymized healthy Dutch individuals to establish the frequency of medically actionable disease alleles in an outbred population of European descent. Our study shows that 1 in 38 healthy individuals (2.7%) has a (likely) pathogenic variant in one of 59 medically actionable dominant disease genes for which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends disclosure. Additionally, we identified 36 individuals (2.2%) to be a carrier of a recessive pathogenic disease allele. Whereas these frequencies of secondary findings are in line with what has been reported in the East-Asian population, the pathogenic variants are differently distributed across the 59 ACMG genes. Our results contribute to the debate on genetic risk factor screening in healthy individuals and the discussion whether the potential benefits of this knowledge and related preventive options, outweigh the risk of the emotional impact of the test result and possible stigmatization.",

This disease is a complex of four conditions caused by dysfunctions of one of genes coding for lysosomal enzymes involved in degradation of heparan sulfate: SGSH (coding for heparan N-sulfatase) - causing MPS IIIA, NAGLU (coding for alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase) - causing MPS IIIB, HGSNAT (coding for acetyl CoA alpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase) - causing MPS IIIC), and GNS (coding for N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase) - causing MPS IIID. The primary storage is responsible for some disease symptoms, but other arise as a result of secondary storage, including glycosphingolipids, and subsequent processes, like oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Central nervous system is predominantly affected in all subtypes of MPS III. Heparan sulfate and its derivatives are the most commonly used biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction procedures.

NK cells use a plethora of activating and inhibitory receptors to recognize these changes and attack targets, but tumour cells often evade NK cells. Therefore, major efforts are being made to hone in on NK cell antitumour properties in immunotherapy.

Human NK cells exclusively recognize tumor-bound IgG by the FcR CD16A (Fc\u03b3RIIIA). Unlike other NK cell activating receptors, the cell surface density of CD16A can be rapidly downregulated in a cis manner by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 following NK cell stimulation in various manners. CD16A downregulation takes place in cancer patients and this may affect the efficacy of tumor-targeting mAbs. We examined the effects of MEDI3622, a human mAb and potent ADAM17 inhibitor, on NK cell activation by antibody-bound tumor cells. MEDI3622 effectively blocked ADAM17 function in NK cells and caused a marked increase in their production of IFN\u03b3. This was observed for NK cells exposed to different tumor cell lines and therapeutic antibodies, and over a range of effector/target ratios. The augmented release of IFN\u03b3 by NK cells was reversed by a function-blocking CD16A mAb. In addition, NK92 cells, a human NK cell line that lacks endogenous Fc\u03b3Rs, expressing a recombinant non-cleavable version of CD16A released significantly higher levels of IFN\u03b3 than NK92 cells expressing equivalent levels of wildtype CD16A. Taken together, our data show that MEDI3622 enhances the release of IFN\u03b3 by NK cells engaging antibody-bound tumor cells by blocking the shedding of CD16A.

ADAM17 can be activated by stimulation of several tyrosine kinase receptors, raising questions about whether oncogenic tyrosine kinases could also enhance EGFR signaling and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via stimulation of ADAM17. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role of Src in activating ADAM17. We provide evidence that a constitutively active transforming form of Src, the E378G mutant, as well as v-Src enhance ADAM17-mediated shedding of the EGFR ligand TGF\u03b1. Moreover, we demonstrate that constitutive shedding of TGF\u03b1 can be reduced by inhibition of Src in several cell lines, including COS7, MCF7 (the human breast cancer cell line), PAE (a pig aortic endothelial cell line) and HaCaT (the human keratinocyte cell line) cells. Src(E378G)-stimulated shedding of TGF\u03b1 is abolished in Adam17(-/-) cells, but can be rescued by wild-type (wt) ADAM17 and a mutant ADAM17 lacking its cytoplasmic domain. These findings demonstrate that ADAM17 is the principal TGF\u03b1 sheddase that is activated by Src in a manner that does not require the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17. Finally, we show that stimulation of ADAM17 by Src(E378G) leads to enhanced paracrine signaling via release of EGFR ligands into the culture supernatant. These results raise the possibility that activation of ADAM17 by oncogenic forms of Src can aid in promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing signaling via the EGFR and ERK in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Enhanced autocrine signaling could further activate tumor cells expressing oncogenic mutants of Src, whereas paracrine signaling could stimulate EGFR and ERK signaling in surrounding non-transformed cells such as stromal cells, thereby contributing to crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells.",

Here we demonstrate that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17), a main sheddase for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, is essential for defensive epithelial properties against UC by promoting epithelial cell growth and goblet cell differentiation in mouse and human. Mice with systemic deletion of Adam17 developed severe dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis when compared to mice with myeloid cell Adam17 deletion or control littermates. ADAM17 was predominantly expressed by regenerating epithelia in control mice, and its loss or inhibition attenuated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, epithelial proliferation, mucus production and barrier functions. Conversely, ectopic EGFR stimulation promoted epithelial regeneration thereby partially rescuing the severe colitis caused by ADAM17 deficiency. In UC patients, epithelial ADAM17 expression positively correlated with both cell proliferation and goblet cell number.

We provide a systematic review comprising all three disease entities of orofacial granulomatosis using the computerized database \"Pubmed Medline\" entering the keywords \"orofacial granulomatosis\" (141 references), \"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome\" (207 references), \"granulomatous cheilitis\" or \"cheilitis granulomatosa\" (102 references) back to 1956. Full-text journals and case studies were included, and data synthesis was performed individually. Etiology remains unclear for all three disease entities. Etiological relatedness to chronic inflammatory bowel disease is under discussion and effectiveness was found for different treatments, e.g. local triamcinolone injections, antibiotics, surgical interventions, TNF alpha blockers or exclusive enteral nutrition. No randomized controlled trial concerning the therapy of orofacial granulomatosis was found. As a consequence, the therapeutic conclusion is drawn mainly from small case series, thus limiting the evidence of therapeutic interventions. OFG with the sub-entities MRS and cheilitis granulomatosa is an etiological obscure disease process with various possible therapeutic interventions potentially alleviating the disease course but to broaden treatment knowledge further study in randomized controlled trials is needed.",

It is rarely possible to observe all aspects of the classical triad at the same time, since these symptoms may appear in different times of life cycle. The most common symptom is orofacial edema. Although etiology of MRS is unclear, various factors such as infections, genetic predisposition, immune deficiency, food intolerance and stress have been held responsible.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065902": " Orofacial granulomatosis is a relatively recent term coined by Wiesenfield et al. in 1985 to define granulomatous lesions of oral mucosa without intestinal involvement. When it presents in a triad encompassing facial nerve palsy, lip swelling, and fissured or furrowed tongue it is called Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome while monosymptomatic or oligosymptomatic forms are referred to as granulomatous cheilitis. It is an uncommon clinicopathologic entity which is distinct from classic Crohn's disease. The NOD2 variant which is commonly associated with Crohn's has not been shown to have any association with orofacial granulomatosis. We present a case of a 31-year-old white man who had painful swelling of the lip with oral ulcers and difficulty eating for 2 to 3 years. He was diagnosed as having granulomatous cheilitis based on characteristic biopsy findings. There was serologic evidence of Crohn's disease with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. However, he was not found to have any gastrointestinal involvement based on computed tomography enterography, and upper and lower endoscopies. He failed to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and dapsone therapy but responded well to high doses of infliximab. Our case questions whether granulomatous cheilitis really exists or is it simply a variant of Crohn's disease with only oral presentation. Our patient did not have symptoms of Crohn's disease; moreover, endoscopic studies and computed tomography enterography were unremarkable for evidence of intestinal involvement. Our case is also the first reported case where high-dose infliximab alone has been used with sustained response for approximately 8 months. In conclusion, more research is needed to assess the underlying pathology as well as ideal treatment options for patients with orofacial granulomatosis. We propose that high-dose infliximab should be considered in patients who do not respond to traditional therapies.",

Large case series including treatment are limited. A retrospective records review was performed for the diagnoses Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, granulomatous cheilitis, and orofacial granulomatosis, confirmed by noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota (1979-2009). There were 72 patients [51 women (71 %), mean age at presentation 39 years (range 8-79)] identified with facial edema with noncaseating granulomas on skin biopsy. Lingua plicata occurred in 34 cases (47 %, 95 % confidence interval 35.3-59.3 %). Unilateral or partial facial nerve palsy occurred in 14 cases (19.4, 95 % confidence interval 11.4-30.8 %). Comorbidities among those with facial edema included periodontal disease (n = 10, 14 %), history of allergic disease (n = 10, 14 %), Crohn's Disease (n = 6, 8 %), migraine headaches (n = 5, 7 %), and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 2, 3 %). There were no patients who had low C1q or C4 levels among those who were tested. Overall, the full triad canonical of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome was observed in nine patients (seven female, median age at symptomatic presentation 35 years (range 10-74 years), 13 %, (95 % confidence interval 6.2-22.9 %) with a median time from first symptoms to diagnosis of 4 years (range 1-35). The medication treatments attempted in the nine patients with the full triad of symptoms included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral and intra-lesional steroids, metronidazole, dapsone, acyclovir, methotrexate, and thalidomide with no consistent treatment responses. The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome may present over the course of most of the lifespan and may require several years of observation to be diagnosed. Neurologists who observe a combination of facial edema and facial palsy in a patient should consider the diagnosis of MRS and proceed to a diagnostic skin biopsy and a trial of steroid treatment for their patient.",

The case is probably the first description available in the literature of the Melkersson-Rosenthal as an early manifestation of mixed connective tissue disease. The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome consists of a triad of recurrent lip and/or face swelling, fissured tongue, and intermittent facial palsy. Mixed connective tissue disease is a multisystemic disorder with overlapping features of systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis, and is differentiated from them by a high titer of antibodies to ribonucleoprotein. The paper presents a case report of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome with an onset in childhood that derived from vasculitis that turned out to be an early manifestation of mixed connective tissue disease. We used MRI to evaluate patient's brain structure and Immunoblot Ena Profil 1 test to test serum autoantibodies level. The patient has a typical for Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome triad of symptoms: bilateral facial nerve palsy, lingua plicata and facial oedema. Both TC and MRI of the head show no changes as well as laboratory tests except Anti-SS-A (Anti-Ro) and Anti-RNP autoantibody serum level that was highly positive. Neurological involvement of the MCTD usually includes, according to the frequency of the occurrence, trigeminal neuralgia, headaches, sensorineural hearing, cerebral haemorrhage, transverse myelitis, cauda equina syndrome, retinal vasculitis, progressive multifocal encephalopathy, and demyelinating neuropathy. For clinical practice it is important to remember that Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome can also be the neurological manifestation of MCTD, especially when accompanied by other systemic symptoms.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8725591": "The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial paralysis, and fissured tongue. Exacerbations and recurrences are common. The orofacial swelling is characterized by fissured, reddish-brown, swollen, nonpruritic lips or firm edema of the face. The facial palsy is indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. The fissured tongue is seen in one third to one half of patients and, although the least common manifestation, its presence assists in diagnosis. The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Thus, the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a disease with elements of orofacial granulomatosis. Orofacial granulomatosis is a clinicopathologic entity describing oral lesions with noncaseating granulomas. The spectrum of this entity includes patients with oral Crohn's disease, patients with oral lesions who will develop typical bowel symptoms of Crohn's disease in the ensuing months to years, patients with tooth-associated infections, patients with sarcoidosis, and patients with food or contact allergies. The value of the clinicopathologic construct of orofacial granulomatosis is to provoke the careful search for provocative causes for the reactive symptom complex of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.",

To assess whether at least 1 dose of galcanezumab was superior to placebo for episodic migraine prevention. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the United States (July 7, 2014, to August 19, 2015) in clinics of 37 licensed physicians with a specialty including, but not limited to, psychiatry, neurology, internal medicine, and primary care. Subcutaneous injections of galcanezumab, 5, 50, 120, or 300 mg, or placebo were given monthly during the 3-month treatment period. A total of 936 patients were assessed; 526 did not meet study entry or baseline criteria and 410 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or galcanezumab. Analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Short-term migraine treatments were allowed as needed except for opioids or barbiturates. To determine if at least 1 of the 4 doses of galcanezumab tested was superior to placebo for migraine prevention measured by the mean change from baseline in the number of migraine headache days 9 weeks to 12 weeks after randomization. Of the 936 patients assessed, 410 met entry criteria (aged 18-65 years with 4-14 migraine headache days per month and migraine onset prior to age 50 years) and were randomized to receive placebo or galcanezumab. For the primary end point, galcanezumab, 120 mg, significantly reduced migraine headache days compared with placebo (99.6% posterior probability -4.8 days; 90% BCI, -5.4 to -4.2 days vs 95% superiority threshold [Bayesian analysis] -3.7 days; 90% BCI, -4.1 to -3.2 days).

After randomization, 410 patients were administered 5, 50, 120 or 300 mg of galcanezumab or placebo subcutaneously once every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, followed by a post-treatment off-drug period lasting 12 weeks. Results Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were primarily rated as mild to moderate. Serious adverse events reported in galcanezumab dose groups were appendicitis, Crohn's disease, suicidal ideation, and congenital ankyloglossia in an infant of a paternal pregnancy; each of these were reported by one patient. Adverse events leading to discontinuation with galcanezumab treatment were abdominal pain, visual impairment, and upper limb fracture, each reported by one patient. Treatment-emergent injection-site reactions were reported significantly more frequently ( p = 0.013) with galcanezumab (13.9%) than with placebo (5.8%). Injection-site pain was the most common injection-site reaction (galcanezumab 11.4%; placebo 2.9%, p = 0.004).

Clinical studies show calcitonin gene-related peptide levels correlate with migraine attacks, and decreases in this neuropeptide can indicate antimigraine therapy effectiveness. Research has revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing unmet medical need of patients. Triptans have offered some clinical benefit, but many patients do not respond and these drugs have important safety considerations. Initial calcitonin gene-related peptide-focused research led to development of the \"gepant\" small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. Positive efficacy reports concerning the gepants have been tempered by safety findings which led to the discontinuation of some of these agents. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab).

Further long-term and large-scale trials are currently under way to verify the safety and efficacy profile of mAbs. In particular, the potential risk of vascular adverse events and the role of anti-drug antibodies deserve special attention. Anti-CGRP peptide and anti-CGRP receptor antibodies are the first effective treatments, which were specifically developed for the prevention of migraine. Their site of action in migraine prevention is most likely peripheral due to large molecule size, which prevents the penetration through the blood-brain barrier and thereby shows that peripheral components play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of a CNS disease.",

Methods A global, double-blind, 6-month study of patients with episodic migraine was undertaken with 915 intent-to-treat patients randomized to monthly galcanezumab 120 mg (n = 231) or 240 mg (n = 223) or placebo (n = 461) subcutaneous injections. Primary endpoint was overall mean change from baseline in monthly migraine headache days. Key secondary endpoints were \u226550%, \u2265 75%, and 100% response rates; monthly migraine headache days with acute migraine medication use; Patient Global Impression of Severity rating; the Role Function-Restrictive score of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Results Mean monthly migraine headache days were reduced by 4.3 and 4.2 days by galcanezumab 120 and 240 mg, respectively, and 2.3 days by placebo. The group differences (95% CIs) versus placebo were 2.0 (-2.6, -1.5) and 1.9 (-2.4, -1.4), respectively. Both doses were superior to placebo for all key secondary endpoints. Injection site pain was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event, reported at similar rates in all treatment groups. Both galcanezumab doses had significantly more injection site reactions and injection site pruritus, and the 240 mg group had significantly more injection site erythema versus placebo.

The humanized monoclonal antibody galcanezumab (LY2951742) binds to CGRP and may be effective in migraine prophylaxis. <b>Objectives:</b> The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of galcanezumab in humans. Secondary objectives included assessing the pharmacokinetics and evaluating target engagement. <b>Methods:</b> A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT 01337596\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT 01337596</a>) with single escalating and multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of galcanezumab was performed in healthy male volunteers. Single doses of 1, 5, 25, 75, 200, and 600 mg of galcanezumab (<i>n</i> = 7/dose) or placebo (<i>n</i> = 2/dose) were injected SC in six consecutive cohorts of nine subjects each. One cohort of nine subjects received multiple (4) 150 mg doses of galcanezumab or placebo every other week. Target engagement was evaluated by measuring inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in dermal blood flow (DBF). <b>Findings:</b> Sixty-three subjects were randomized and included in the safety analyses. Galcanezumab was well tolerated in single doses (1-600 mg SC) and consecutive doses (150 mg SC). There was no dose-dependent difference in type or frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, and no clinically meaningful difference when compared with placebo. Pharmacokinetics were linear. Galcanezumab induced a robust, dose-dependent, and durable inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF, supporting the continued clinical development of galcanezumab for prophylaxis in migraine patients.",

Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine headache days (MHD) in patients with episodic and chronic migraine. A post hoc analysis of the proportion of patients with 100% response (100% reduction from baseline in monthly MHD) was calculated for each month from pooled data of 2 double-blind, 6-month galcanezumab studies in patients with episodic migraine (4 to 14 MHD and \u22652 migraine attacks per month at baseline). The patients were randomized (1:1:2) to monthly subcutaneous galcanezumab, 120 mg (after 240 mg initial loading dose) or 240 mg, or placebo. A generalized linear mixed model with effects for baseline MHD, treatment, month, and treatment-by-month interaction was used to estimate the mean monthly response rate. The analysis included 1739 patients treated with galcanezumab, 120 mg (n = 436) or 240 mg (n = 428), or placebo (n = 875). The mean monthly 100% response rate on an average month in the 6-month double-blind phase was greater for galcanezumab 120 mg (13.5%) and 240 mg (14.3%) groups vs placebo (5.9%) with odds ratios of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9, 3.2) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.0, 3.4), respectively (P &lt; .001). The rate of 100% monthly response increased at each month over the 6-month double-blind phase with higher rates for galcanezumab dose groups (9 to 21%) than placebo (2 to 10%) (P &lt; .02). Evaluation of 100% response by the number of months showed a greater proportion of galcanezumab-treated patients in either dose group, compared to placebo, were able to achieve a 100% response (P &lt; .001 up to 3 months); however, though greater than placebo, few galcanezumab patients had \u22654 months of 100% response (P &lt; .02). The proportions of patients with 100% response were greatest in the last 3 months of the treatment. Considering the average number days between nonconsecutive MHD across the 6-month period (not just during the times of 100% response), the duration of migraine headache-free periods in the galcanezumab groups was 29 days for those with at least 1 month of 100% response and 55 days for those with at least 3 months of 100% response. This gap was approximately 6 to 11 times greater than the mean gap of 5 days observed at baseline. More than a third of the patients with episodic migraine treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg achieved 100% response for at least 1 month. More patients had 100% monthly response in the last 3 months of the 6-month double-blind period.

This study evaluated the safety and tolerability, as well as the effectiveness of galcanezumab for up to 12 months of treatment in patients with migraine. Patients diagnosed with episodic or chronic migraine, 18 to 65 years old, that were not exposed previously to galcanezumab, were randomized to receive galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg, administered subcutaneously once monthly for a year. Safety and tolerability were evaluated by frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events (AEs) leading to study discontinuation. Laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and suicidality were also analyzed. Additionally, overall change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days, functioning, and disability were assessed.

Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring. Elucidating the molecular mechanism for this unusual mode of inheritance will provide new insights into how mtDNA is passed on from parent to offspring and may even lead to the development of new avenues for the therapeutic treatment for pathogenic mtDNA transmission.",

Increasing inhibitory function through stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors may attenuate excitotoxic effects and improve outcome. The present experiment examined the effects of diazepam, a positive modulator at the GABA(A) receptor, on survival and cognitive performance in traumatically brain-injured animals. In experiment 1, 15 min prior to central fluid percussion brain injury, rats (n=8 per group) were injected (i.p.) with saline or diazepam (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg). Additional rats (n=8) were surgically prepared but not injured (sham-injury). Rats pre-treated with the 5 mg/kg dose of diazepam had significantly lower mortality (0%) than injured, saline-treated rats (53%). Also, diazepam-treated (5 mg/kg) rats had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze test performed 11-15 days post-injury. In experiment 2, at 15 min post-injury, rats were given either saline (n=5) or 5 mg/kg diazepam (n=6). Rats treated with diazepam did not differ in mortality from injured rats treated with vehicle. However, rats treated with diazepam at 15 min post-injury had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze than injured, vehicle-treated rats. In experiment 3, the post-injury administration of bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg, n=8), a GABA(A) antagonist, increased Morris water maze goal latencies compared to injured animals treated with saline (n=8). These results suggest that enhancing inhibitory function during the acute post-injury period produces beneficial effects on both survival and outcome following experimental TBI.",

However, the method cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results. We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes. mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29444201": " Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (&gt;85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. Methods that align RNA-seq reads to a diploid transcriptome incorporating known genetic variants improve estimates of ASE and total gene expression compared to methods that use reference genome alignments. Weighted allocation methods outperform methods that discard multi-reads. Hierarchical allocation of reads improves estimation of ASE even when data are simulated from a non-hierarchical model. Analysis of RNA-seq data from F1 hybrid mice using EMASE reveals widespread ASE associated with cis-acting polymorphisms and a small number of parent-of-origin effects.

Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal polysomnography. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was conducted on one CANTAB and one polysomnography parameter of interest. CEP-26401 was slowly absorbed (median tmax range 3-6 hours) and the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 24-60 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved within six days of dosing. CEP-26401 exhibits dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics, and renal excretion is a major elimination pathway. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep, with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model, with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.

The purpose of this review is to acquaint the reader with the current understanding of H3 receptor localization and function as a modulator of neurotransmitter release and its effects on cognitive processes, as well as to provide an update on selected H3 antagonists in various states of preclinical and clinical advancement. Blockade of centrally localized H3 receptors by selective H3 receptor antagonists has been shown to enhance the release of neurotransmitters such as histamine, ACh, dopamine and norepinephrine, among others, which play important roles in cognitive processes. The cognitive-enhancing effects of H3 antagonists across multiple cognitive domains in a wide number of preclinical cognition models also bolster confidence in this therapeutic approach for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, although a number of clinical studies examining the efficacy of H3 receptor antagonists for a variety of cognitive disorders are currently underway, no clinical proof of concept for an H3 receptor antagonist has been reported to date.

Fecal microbiota transplantation's success as a therapy for C. difficile has inspired interest in performing clinical trials that experiment with fecal microbiota transplantation as a therapy for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Results from clinical trials that use fecal microbiota transplantation to treat inflammatory bowel disease suggest that, for at least one condition beyond C. difficile, most fecal microbiota transplantation donors produce stool that is not efficacious. The optimal strategies for identifying and using efficacious donors have not been investigated. We therefore examined the optimal Bayesian response-adaptive strategy for allocating patients to donors and formulated a computationally tractable myopic heuristic. This heuristic computes the probability that a donor is efficacious by updating prior expectations about the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation, the placebo rate, and the fraction of donors that produce efficacious stool. In simulations designed to mimic a recent fecal microbiota transplantation clinical trial, for which traditional power calculations predict [Formula: see text] statistical power, we found that accounting for differences in donor stool efficacy reduced the predicted statistical power to [Formula: see text]. For these simulations, using the heuristic Bayesian allocation strategy more than quadrupled the statistical power to [Formula: see text]. We use the results of similar simulations to make recommendations about the number of patients, the number of donors, and the choice of clinical endpoint that clinical trials should use to optimize their ability to detect if fecal microbiota transplantation is effective for treating a condition.",

Patients were prospectively followed both clinically and with stool assessments for 8 weeks post FMT. Assessments occurred at 1 week and 4 weeks post FMT to assess for failure. Failure was defined as presence of diarrhoeal symptoms and a positive CDI stool test by polymerase chain reaction for toxin gene (PCR) at any time point during the 8-week follow-up period. CDI stool testing using PCR was performed at weeks 1 and 4 post FMT in asymptomatic patients as well. 167 patients were included. Twenty-eight patients (16.7% (28/167)) were FMT failures throughout the 8-week period. At week 1, seven patients had already failed the FMT. Of the remaining 160 patients, 144 were asymptomatic, and among these, 141 were negative for C. difficile toxin gene by PCR. This resulted in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 2.1% (3/144). At week 4, 143 patients had not yet failed FMT. Of these patients 129 patients were asymptomatic and among those, 125 were negative by PCR, resulting in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 3% (3/129).

While previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for FMT, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat CDI. Here we report that high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following FMT using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. Similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. Post FMT samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were less abundant (&lt; 5%) than that found in patients prior to FMT. Post FMT samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the Bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of members of the families Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of Bacteroides, Alistipes and Parabacteroides genera. Members of the phylum Firmicutes were represented by Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified Clostridiales and members of the Firmicutes. One patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal Proteobacteria, primarily Enterobacteriaceae.

There have been many well-conducted randomized controlled trials and thousands of patients reported in case series that describe success rates of approximately 90% following one or more FMT. Although the exact mechanisms of FMT have yet to be fully elucidated, replacement or restoration of a 'normal' microbiota (or at least a microbiota resembling those who have never had CDI) appears to have a positive effect on the gut dysbiosis that is thought to exist in these patients. Furthermore, despite being aesthetically unappealing, this 'ultimate probiotic' is a particularly attractive solution to a difficult problem that avoids repeated courses of antibiotics. The lack of clarity about the exact mechanism of action and the 'active ingredient' of FMT (e.g., individual or communities of bacteria, bacteriophage, or bioactive molecules such as bile acids) has hindered the ability to produce a standardized and well-characterized FMT product. There is no standard method to produce material for FMT, and there are a multitude of factors that can vary between institutions that offer this therapy. Only a few studies have directly compared clinical efficacy in groups of patients who have been treated with FMT prepared differently (e.g., fresh vs. frozen) or administered by different route (e.g., by nasojejunal tube, colonoscopy or by oral administration of encapsulated product). More of these studies should be undertaken to clarify the superiority or otherwise of these variables. This review describes the methods and protocols that two English NHS hospitals independently adopted over the same time period to provide FMT for patients with recurrent CDI. There are several fundamental differences in the methods used, including selection and testing of donors, procedures for preparation and storage of material, and route of administration. These methods are described in detail in this review highlighting differing practice. Despite these significant methodological variations, clinical outcomes in terms of cure rate appear to be remarkably similar for both FMT providers. Although both hospitals have treated only modest numbers of patients, these findings suggest that many of the described differences may not be critical factors in influencing the success of the procedure. As FMT is increasingly being proposed for a number of conditions other than CDI, harmonization of methods and techniques may be more critical to the success of FMT, and thus it will be important to standardize these as far as practically possible.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076071": "Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common nosocomial infections. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota due to consumption of antibiotics is a major contributor to CDI. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied to treat CDI. However, FMT has important limitations including uncontrolled exposure to pathogens and standardization issues. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate alternative treatment methods, such as bacteriotherapy, as well as the mechanism through which beneficial bacteria inhibit the growth of C. difficile. Here, we report bile acid-mediated inhibition of C. difficile by Bacteroides strains which can produce bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Bacteroides strains are not commonly used to treat CDI; however, as they comprise a large proportion of the intestinal microbiota, they can contribute to bile acid-mediated inhibition of C. difficile. The inhibitory effect on C. difficile growth increased with increasing bile acid concentration in the presence of Bacteroides ovatus SNUG 40239. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect on C. difficile growth was significantly attenuated when bile acid availability was reduced by cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant. The findings of this study are important due to the discovery of a new bacterial strain that in the presence of available bile acids inhibits growth of C. difficile. These results will facilitate development of novel bacteriotherapy strategies to control CDI.",

As previously reported, the success of heterologous FMT (90%) was superior to that of autologous FMT (43%) (P = 0.019), and post-FMT intestinal bacterial communities differed significantly between treatment arms (P &lt; 0.001). Subjects cured by autologous FMT typically had greater abundances of the Clostridium XIVa clade and Holdemania bacteria prior to treatment, and the relative abundances of these groups increased significantly after FMT compared to heterologous FMT and pre-FMT samples. The typical shift to post-FMT, donor-like assemblages, featuring high relative abundances of genera within the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, was not observed in the autologous FMT subjects. Autologous FMT patient bacterial communities were significantly different in composition than those for heterologous FMT patients and donors (P &lt; 0.001). The SourceTracker program, which employs a Bayesian algorithm to determine source contributions to sink communities, showed that patients initially treated by heterologous FMT had significantly higher percentages of engraftment (i.e., similarity to donor communities, mean value of 74%) compared to those who suffered recurrence following autologous FMT (1%) (P \u2264 0.013). The findings of this study suggest that complete donor engraftment may be not necessary if functionally critical taxa are present in subjects following antibiotic therapy. This study provides a detailed characterization of fecal bacterial communities in subjects who participated in a previously published randomized clinical trial to treat recurrent C. difficile infection (rCDI). Bacterial communities were characterized to determine differences between subjects who received fecal bacteria either from healthy donor stool samples or their own stool samples as \"placebo\" in order to determine which groups of bacteria were most important in achieving a cure. The results of this study suggested that bacteria associated with secondary bile acid metabolism could potentially provide resistance to infection and that complete transfer of healthy donor microorganisms was not necessary to resolve CDI following unsuccessful antibiotic treatment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24939885": "Clostridium difficile infection is one of the most common health care-associated infections, and up to 40% of patients suffer from recurrence of disease following standard antibiotic therapy. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difficile infection. It is hypothesized that FMT aids in recovery of a microbiota capable of colonization resistance to C. difficile. However, it is not fully understood how this occurs. Here we investigated changes in the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, and imputed a hypothetical functional profile based on the 16S rRNA profile using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following transplantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor profile than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we observed differences in the imputed metagenomic profile. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural changes following this therapy. Further identification of the specific community members and functions that promote colonization resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C. difficile infection. Within the last decade, Clostridium difficile infection has surpassed other bacterial infections to become the leading cause of nosocomial infections. Antibiotic use, which disrupts the gut microbiota and its capability in providing colonization resistance against C. difficile, is a known risk factor in C. difficile infection. In particular, recurrent C. difficile remains difficult to treat with standard antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method for some patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown. Our results provide insight into the structural and potential metabolic changes that occur following FMT, which may aid in the development of new treatment methods for C. difficile infection.",

In addition, FMT is being investigated for a variety of indications where restoration or restructuring of the gut microbial community is hypothesized to be beneficial. We sought to develop a stable, freeze-dried encapsulated preparation of standardized fecal microbiota that can be used for FMT with ease and convenience in clinical practice and research. We systematically developed a lyophilization protocol that preserved the viability of bacteria across the taxonomic spectrum found in fecal microbiota and yielded physicochemical properties that enabled consistent encapsulation. We also treated a cohort of R-CDI patients with a range of doses of encapsulated microbiota and analyzed the associated changes in the fecal microbiome of the recipients. The optimized lyophilized preparation satisfied all our preset goals for physicochemical properties, encapsulation ease, stability at different temperatures, and microbiota viability in vitro and in vivo (germ-free mice). The capsule treatment was administered to 49 patients. Overall, 43/49 (88%) of patients achieved a clinical success, defined as no recurrence of CDI over 2 months. Analysis of the fecal microbiome demonstrated near normalization of the fecal microbial community by 1 month following FMT treatment. The simplest protocol using the lowest dose (2.1-2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> bacteria in 2-3 capsules) without any colon purgative performed equally well in terms of clinical outcomes and microbiota engraftment. A single administration of encapsulated, freeze-dried fecal microbiota from a healthy donor was highly successful in treating antibiotic-refractory R-CDI syndrome.",

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of FMT in the treatment of CDI. Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane database were used. The authors searched studies with 10 or more patients examining the resolution of symptoms after FMT in patients with CDI. Reviews, letters to the editors, and abstracts were excluded. Participants were patients with CDI. Intervention used was FMT. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Results were synthesized using a narrative approach. Retrospective and uncontrolled prospective cohort studies suggest that FMT is a highly effective therapy for recurrent/refractory CDI, with clinical success rates ranging from 83% to 100%, which is similar to rates published by two randomized controlled trials. Fecal microbiota transplantation may be effectively administered via antegrade (upper gastrointestinal) or retrograde (lower gastrointestinal) routes of delivery. Fecal microbiota transplantation rarely results in major adverse events. However, diarrhea, cramping, and bloating commonly occur and are typically self-limited. Most studies were uncontrolled retrospective studies. Fecal microbiota transplantation should be considered in patients with recurrent episodes of mild to moderate CDI who have failed conventional antimicrobial therapy. There is insufficient evidence to recommend FMT for the treatment of severe CDI. Systematic review, level III.",

But variability in fecal bacterial communities-believed to be the therapeutic agent-can complicate or undermine treatment efficacy. To understand the effects of transplant preparation methods on living fecal microbial communities, we applied a DNA-sequencing method (PMA-seq) that uses propidium monoazide (PMA) to differentiate between living and dead fecal microbes, and we created an analysis pipeline to identify individual bacteria that change in abundance between samples. We found that oxygen exposure degraded fecal bacterial communities, whereas freeze-thaw cycles and lag time between donor defecation and transplant preparation had much smaller effects. Notably, the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-an anti-inflammatory commensal bacterium whose absence is linked to inflammatory bowel disease-decreased with oxygen exposure. Our results indicate that some current practices for preparing microbiota transplant material adversely affect living fecal microbial content and highlight PMA-seq as a valuable tool to inform best practices and evaluate the suitability of clinical fecal material.",

We followed up the relief of symptoms and long-term, over-a-year microbiota stabilization in a 46-year-old man, who underwent FMT for antibiotic-induced, non-CDI colitis nine months after being treated for CDI by FMT. Fecal and mucosal microbiota was analyzed before the second FMT and during 14 months after FMT by using a high-throughput phylogenetic microarray. FMT resolved the symptoms and restored normal GI-function. Microbiota analysis revealed increased bacterial diversity in the rectal mucosa and a stable fecal microbiota up to three months after FMT. A number of mucosa-associated bacteria increased after FMT and some of these bacteria remained increased in feces up to 14 months. Notably, the increased bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are presumed to be anti-inflammatory.

A critical appraisal of the clinical research evidence on the effectiveness and safety of FMT for the treatment of patients with CD-associated diarrhea was made. Twenty full-text case series, 15 case reports, and 1 randomized controlled study were included for the final analysis. Almost all patients treated with donors' fecal infusion experienced recurrent episodes of CD-associated diarrhea despite standard antibiotic treatment. Of a total of 536 patients treated, 467 (87%) experienced resolution of diarrhea. Diarrhea resolution rates varied according to the site of infusion: 81% in the stomach; 86% in the duodenum/jejunum; 93% in the cecum/ascending colon; and 84% in the distal colon. No severe adverse events were reported with the procedure. FMT seems efficacious and safe for the treatment of recurrent CDI.

Public insurer for all hospital and physician services. Ontario, Canada. A decision analytic model was used to model costs and lifetime health effects of each strategy for a typical patient experiencing up to three recurrences, over 18 weeks. Recurrence data and utilities were obtained from published sources. Cost data was obtained from published sources and hospitals in Toronto, Canada. The willingness-to-pay threshold was $50,000/QALY gained. Fecal transplantation by colonoscopy dominated all other strategies in the base case, as it was less costly and more effective than all alternatives. After accounting for uncertainty in all model parameters, there was an 87% probability that fecal transplantation by colonoscopy was the most beneficial strategy. If colonoscopy was not available, fecal transplantation by enema was cost-effective at $1,708 per QALY gained, compared to metronidazole. In addition, fecal transplantation by enema was the preferred strategy if the probability of recurrence following this strategy was below 8.7%. If fecal transplantation by any means was unavailable, fidaxomicin was cost-effective at an additional cost of $25,968 per QALY gained, compared to metronidazole.

Our previous study revealed that there might be the presence of extensive metabolites of pimavanserin in rats. However, the metabolic fate of pimavanserin in vivo remains unknown. Thus, it is essential to develop an efficient method to investigate the metabolic profile of pimavanserin in rats. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to date has the highest mass measurement accuracy and resolution of any mass spectrometry platform. After a single intragastric administration of pimavanserin at a dose of 50 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> , plasma, bile, urine and feces were collected from rats. A novel and efficient strategy was developed to analyze the metabolic profile of pimavanserin in vivo based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with FT-ICR-MS. A total of 23 metabolites were detected and tentatively identified through comparing their mass spectrometry profiles with those of pimavanserin. These metabolites were found in feces (22), bile (21), rat urine (16) and plasma (15). Results demonstrated that metabolic pathways of pimavanserin in rats included dehydrogenation, demethylation, deethylation, depropylation, debutylation, hydroxylation, dihydroxylation and trihydroxylation. A total of 22 phase I metabolites of pimavanserin were detected and tentatively identified. This report presents the first study of screening and identification of the metabolites of pimavanserin.

It analyzes the pharmacological, behavioral and molecular mechanisms of pimavanserin and their contribution to the therapeutic advantages of the drug as reported in published preclinical and clinical studies, press releases and product labels. Expert opinion: Pimavanserin exhibits a unique pharmacological profile with nanomolar affinity at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Functionally, it acts as a potent inverse agonist at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, with selectivity over 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and no appreciable activity at other neurotransmitter receptors. Behavioral studies found that pimavanserin reversed impaired behaviors in animal models predictive of antipsychotic activity, and with no impairment of motor functions. The drug exhibits long plasma half-life (57 hours), which support its once/day administration. A pivotal phase III clinical trial demonstrated significant improvement in PDP symptoms in patients receiving pimavanserin compared to placebo-treated patients. The drug also displayed relatively benign safety and tolerability profiles.

Data sets for all relevant clinical trials of pimavanserin and the Applicant's and FDA's analyses of these data were considered in this review. Data were available from 616 patients with Parkinson's disease with hallucinations and delusions who received at least 1 dose of pimavanserin, with a total exposure of 825 patient-years in the Parkinson's disease psychosis population. Pimavanserin 34 mg/d was effective in treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease. In the Applicant's single pivotal trial, 80.5% of pimavanserin patients experienced at least some improvement in symptoms compared to 58.1% of patients taking placebo. Pimavanserin did not worsen motor function, an adverse effect commonly observed with other antipsychotics, probably because of a lack of consequential dopamine binding. Pimavanserin is the only FDA-approved treatment for the hallucinations and delusions seen in patients with psychosis of Parkinson's disease. Although pimavanserin appears to have a pharmacologic mechanism that is different from other atypical antipsychotics, concern remained that the increased risk of death seen with antipsychotic use in elderly demented patients, and described in all approved antipsychotic labels, would also occur with pimavanserin. Pimavanserin bears the same boxed warning about the risk of death associated with antipsychotic use in elderly patients with dementia.",

We did a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre (with multiple affiliated nursing home sites across the UK) study. We included participants of either sex who were aged 50 years or older with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease and psychotic symptoms including visual or auditory hallucinations, delusions, or both. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks of oral treatment with either pimavanserin (two 17 mg tablets daily) or placebo, with use of permuted block sizes of four and stratified by baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score (&lt;6 or \u22656) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) psychosis score (&lt;12 or \u226512).

Common adverse events were falls (21 [23%] of 90 participants in the pimavanserin group vs 21 [23%] of 91 in the placebo group), urinary tract infections (20 [22%] vs 25 [28%]), and agitation (19 [21%] vs 13 [14%]). Eight (9%) participants on pimavanserin and 11 (12%) on placebo discontinued treatment because of adverse events. No detrimental effect was observed on cognition or motor function in either group.

Antipsychotic treatments were not permitted during the study, but controlled antiparkinsonian medication or deep brain stimulation was allowed. Eligible participants entered a 2 week non-pharmacological lead-in phase to limit the placebo response, after which they were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive pimavanserin 40 mg per day or matched placebo. The primary outcome was antipsychotic benefit as assessed by central, independent raters with the Parkinson's disease-adapted scale for assessment of positive symptoms (SAPS-PD) in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had a SAPS assessment at baseline and at least one follow-up.

However, clozapine can have adverse effects, including agranulocytosis. The new drug pimavanserin was recently registered in the United States for the treatment of PDP.&lt;br/&gt; AIM: To review the literature on pimavanserin and discuss the position it currently occupies in the Netherlands as a potential treatment for PDP.&lt;br/&gt; METHOD: Systematic search of the literature.&lt;br/&gt; RESULTS: We found reports on four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one review and six articles about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pimavanserin. Pimavanserin is an effective treatment for PDP, and, like clozapine, it has very few negative effects on motor skills. However, all of the RCTs were funded by the manufacturer of pimavanserin and the trials were conducted in a very selective patient population. This means that results cannot be generalised. Long-term results are not yet available. In earlier trials clozapine was shown to have a greater and faster antipsychotic effect. Many clinicians and psychiatrists have a great deal of experience with this drug. Another important point is that no-one has yet conducted a trial comparing clozapine and pimavanserin.&lt;br/&gt; CONCLUSION: Given that the current second drug of choice, namely quetiapine, has not been found to be effective for PDP, we are of the opinion that - if pimavanserin is registered in the Netherlands - pimavanserin could be used when the current drug of choice, clozapine, is not completely effective or is poorly tolerated. For patients who have cognitive impairments in addition to psychosis, we advise testing the patient's reaction to a cholinesterase inhibitor before starting the patient on a course of antipsychotics.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19907417": "Psychotic symptoms occur in up to 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Clozapine and quetiapine, two atypical antipsychotic drugs, at doses markedly lower than those effective in schizophrenia, which, nevertheless, still cause sedation, hypotension, and other side effects, are widely used to treat psychotic symptoms in patients with PD psychosis (PDP), although quetiapine has never been shown to be effective in a placebo-controlled study. The demonstrated efficacy of clozapine in PDP has been attributed to serotonin (5-HT(2A)) receptor blockade. We postulated that pimavanserin (ACP-103), a highly selective 5-HT(2A) inverse agonist, would attenuate psychosis in patients with PDP, but avoid motoric worsening and non-motoric side effects. In this double-blind, randomized multicenter 28-day study, the tolerability and efficacy of pimavanserin was compared with placebo in 60 patients with L-DOPA or dopamine (DA) agonist-induced PDP. Motor function was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II and III. Antipsychotic efficacy was evaluated using multiple measures from the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and a UPDRS Part I psychosis-relevant item. Pimavanserin did not differentiate from placebo with regard to motor impairment, sedation, hypotension, or other side effects. The principal measures of efficacy of antipsychotic response to pimavanserin, the SAPS total domain score, only showed a trend. However, the pimavanserin-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement in some but not all measures of psychosis, including SAPS global measures of hallucinations and delusions, persecutory delusions, and the UPDRS measure of delusions and hallucinations. Pimavanserin showed significantly greater improvement in psychosis in patients with PDP at a dose which did not impair motor function, or cause sedation or hypotension Thus, pimavanserin may represent a novel treatment for PDP. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that attenuation of psychosis secondary to DA receptor stimulation in PDP may be achieved through selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism.",

Thirteen migraine patients, previously enrolled in erenumab anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody trials, received CGRP in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design to investigate their susceptibility to migraine induction. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess the efficacy of previous antibody treatment. The patients were stratified into groups of high responders and poor responders. Primary outcomes were incidence of migraine-like attacks and area under the curve of headache intensity after infusion of CGRP and placebo. All interviews and experiments were performed in laboratories at the Danish Headache Center, Copenhagen, Denmark. Ten high responders and three poor responders were included. CGRP induced migraine-like attacks in ten (77%) patients, whereof two were poor responders, compared to none after placebo (p = 0.002).

Background - CGRP was proposed as a target for primary headache therapies. Translational research involved moving from delineating the relationships between CGRP and primary headaches and the clinical development of anti-CGRP treatments. The first anti-CGRP treatment, an intravenous CGRP-receptor antagonist or gepant, olcegepant, was described as effective in terminating migraines in humans in 2004. Methods - The author briefly reviews some of the pathophysiology and translational research that led to the development of the gepants initially and then subsequently to the anti-CGRP and anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibodies. All accessible randomized controlled trials, abstracts, platform presentations, and press releases on the monoclonal antibody trials are summarized. The trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments. Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018. At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine, galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.

We randomly assigned patients to receive a subcutaneous injection of either erenumab, at a dose of 70 mg or 140 mg, or placebo monthly for 6 months. The primary end point was the change from baseline to months 4 through 6 in the mean number of migraine days per month. Secondary end points were a 50% or greater reduction in mean migraine days per month, change in the number of days of use of acute migraine-specific medication, and change in scores on the physical-impairment and everyday-activities domains of the Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (scale transformed to 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater migraine burden on functioning). A total of 955 patients underwent randomization: 317 were assigned to the 70-mg erenumab group, 319 to the 140-mg erenumab group, and 319 to the placebo group. The mean number of migraine days per month at baseline was 8.3 in the overall population; by months 4 through 6, the number of days was reduced by 3.2 in the 70-mg erenumab group and by 3.7 in the 140-mg erenumab group, as compared with 1.8 days in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). A 50% or greater reduction in the mean number of migraine days per month was achieved for 43.3% of patients in the 70-mg erenumab group and 50.0% of patients in the 140-mg erenumab group, as compared with 26.6% in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001 for each dose vs. placebo), and the number of days of use of acute migraine-specific medication was reduced by 1.1 days in the 70-mg erenumab group and by 1.6 days in the 140-mg erenumab group, as compared with 0.2 days in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). Physical-impairment scores improved by 4.2 and 4.8 points in the 70-mg and 140-mg erenumab groups, respectively, as compared with 2.4 points in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001 for each dose vs. placebo), and everyday-activities scores improved by 5.5 and 5.9 points in the 70-mg and 140-mg erenumab groups, respectively, as compared with 3.3 points in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). The rates of adverse events were similar between erenumab and placebo. Erenumab administered subcutaneously at a monthly dose of 70 mg or 140 mg significantly reduced migraine frequency, the effects of migraines on daily activities, and the use of acute migraine-specific medication over a period of 6 months. The long-term safety and durability of the effect of erenumab require further study.

Lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger avoidance are recommended as preventive measures for all individuals with migraine. The decision to recommend additional migraine preventive therapy should consider the frequency of migraine attacks and headaches, extent of migraine-associated disability, frequency of using acute migraine treatments and the responsiveness to such treatments, and patient preferences. Additional therapies include prescription medications, nutraceuticals, neurostimulation, and behavioral therapy. Considering evidence for efficacy and the risk of potential side effects and adverse events, treatments with the most favorable profiles include (in alphabetical order): amitriptyline, beta-blockers (several), biofeedback, candesartan, coenzyme Q10, cognitive-behavioral therapy, magnesium citrate, onabotulinumtoxinA (for chronic migraine only), relaxation therapy, riboflavin, and topiramate. In addition, erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraine in May 2018. Successful migraine preventive therapy reduces the frequency and burden of attacks while causing limited side effects. Individual treatment recommendations are determined based upon evidence for efficacy, side effect and adverse event profiles, medication interactions, patient comorbidity, costs, and patient preferences. Patients must be counseled on reasonable expectations for their preventive therapy and the importance of adhering to the recommended treatment plan for a period of time that is sufficient to determine outcomes.",

This preplanned interim analysis, conducted after all participants had completed the 1-year open-label follow-up, evaluated changes in monthly migraine days (MMD), achievement of \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reductions, Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQ), Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), and safety. Data reported as observed without imputation for missing data. Of 472 patients enrolled in the parent study, 383 continued in the OLE with a median exposure to erenumab of 575 days (range 28-822 days). Mean (SD) MMD were 8.8 (2.6) at parent study baseline, 6.3 (4.2) at week 12 (beginning of OLE), and 3.7 (4.0) at week 64 (mean change from baseline [reduction] of 5.0 days). At week 64, 65%, 42%, and 26% achieved \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reduction in MMD, respectively. Mean HIT-6 scores were 60.2 (6.3) at baseline and 51.7 (9.2) at week 64. MSQ and MIDAS improvements from baseline were maintained through week 64. Safety profiles during the OLE were similar to those in the double-blind phase, which overall were similar to placebo. One-year efficacy, supported by functional improvements and favorable safety and tolerability profiles, supports further investigation of erenumab as a preventive treatment in patients with EM. <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01952574\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01952574</a>.

CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simplified variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications.

The recently developed combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) method generates predictive scores for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in all areas of the genome, including noncoding regions. We sought for non-coding variants to determine the clinical validity of common CADD scores. We evaluated 12,391 unique SNVs in 624 patient samples submitted for germ-line mutation testing in a cancer-related gene panel. Stratifying by genomic region, we compared the distributions of CADD scores of rare SNVs, SNVs common in our patient population, and the null distribution of all possible SNVs. The median CADD scores of intronic and nonsynonymous variants were significantly different between rare and common SNVs (P &lt; 0.0001). Despite these different distributions, no individual variants could be identified as plausibly causative among the rare intronic variants with the highest scores. The receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for noncoding variants is modest, and the positive predictive value of CADD for intronic variants in panel testing was found to be 0.088. Focused in silico scoring systems with much higher predictive value will be necessary for clinical genomic applications.Genet Med 18 12, 1269-1275.",

Several deleteriousness scores have been proposed for the non-coding part of the genome, but no large-scale comparison has been realized to date to assess their performance. We compared the leading scoring tools (CADD, FATHMM-MKL, Funseq2 and GWAVA) and some recent competitors (DANN, SNP and SOM scores) for their ability to discriminate assumed pathogenic variants from assumed benign variants (using the ClinVar, COSMIC and 1000 genomes project databases). Using the ClinVar benchmark, CADD was the best tool for detecting the pathogenic variants that are mainly located in protein coding gene regions. Using the COSMIC benchmark, FATHMM-MKL, GWAVA and SOMliver outperformed the other tools for pathogenic variants that are typically located in lincRNAs, pseudogenes and other parts of the non-coding genome. However, all tools had low precision, which could potentially be improved by future non-coding genome feature discoveries. These results may have been influenced by the presence of potential benign variants in the COSMIC database. The development of a gold standard as consistent as ClinVar for these regions will be necessary to confirm our tool ranking.

In silico tools to predict pathogenicity are crucial to assess such variants and we have evaluated a new tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), and its classification of gene variants in Lynch syndrome by using a set of 2,210 DNA mismatch repair gene variants. These had already been classified by experts from InSiGHT's Variant Interpretation Committee. Overall, we found CADD scores do predict pathogenicity (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.595, P &lt; 0.001). However, we discovered 31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population allele frequencies, cosegregation analyses, disease association studies, or a second-tier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm their putative pathogenicity. We demonstrate CADD is valuable in prioritizing variants in clinically relevant genes for further assessment by expert classification teams.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28954263": " Prolactinomas are pituitary tumors with a very low prevalence in childhood and adolescence compared to adulthood. This condition is preferentially treated with dopamine agonists. Resistance to these drugs is rare. We describe the case of a boy diagnosed with macroadenoma at the age of 9 and followed up for 21 years. He did not fully respond to treatment with dopamine agonists. His initial prolactin level was 2,400 ng/mL (in males, normal values are &lt;16.0 ng/mL) and never normalized. At the last assessment, his prolactin level was 21.5 ng/mL, recorded after 21 years of treatment with the dopamine agonist cabergoline at a dose as high as 4.5 mg per week. Although the prolactin level remained elevated throughout the follow-up period, the patient never presented a low testosterone level and had normal pubertal development. An MRI of the sella turcica showed that the tumor became progressively cystic and disappeared, but a normal pituitary gland was observed. The pituitary gland retained its normal functions despite a partially empty sella. Long-term treatment with high doses of cabergoline may cause cystic degeneration of a prolactinoma considered to be resistant to this treatment, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this outcome represents the natural development of the tumor.",

These differences have been associated with earlier diagnosis in woman, as well as with serum estradiol levels. Experimental models of prolactinomas in rodents also show a higher incidence in females, and recent findings suggest that gender differences in the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) system might be involved in the sex-specific development of prolactinomas in these models. The aim of this review is to summarize the literature supporting the important role of TGF\u03b21 as a local modulator of pituitary lactotroph function and to provide recent evidence for TGF\u03b21 involvement in the sex differences found in prolactinoma development in animal models.",

They typically occur in women in the 3rd-6th decade of life and rarely in the pediatric population or after menopause. Most women present with irregular menses and/or infertility. Dopamine (DA) agonists, used in their treatment, are safe during pregnancy, but in most cases are discontinued at conception with close monitoring for signs or symptoms of tumor growth. Breastfeeding is safe postpartum, provided there was no significant growth during pregnancy. Some women will experience normalization of prolactin levels postpartum. Menopause may also decrease prolactin levels and even those with macroprolactinomas may consider discontinuing their DA agonist with close follow-up. Prolactinomas may be associated with decreased quality of life scores in women, and play a role in bone health and cardiovascular risk factors.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10686432": "Prolactinoma is the most common type of primary pituitary tumors. It occurs more frequently in women than in men. Dopaminergic agonists are effective in the shrinkage of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor and are preferred in some patients. However, pituitary radiotherapy may enable the long-term removal of prolactin-secreting tumor cells. Recent evidence suggests that prolactinoma is a heterogeneous disorder with complicated and multifactorial etiology and pathogenesis. Apparently, a thorough understanding of prolactinoma tumorigenesis would be important. To facilitate investigations on tumorigenesis of prolactinoma, animal models for prolactinomas have been developed. These models have expedited our progress in the recent years. Many researchers consider the F(344) rat to be the most sensitive strain of rats to estrogen (E(2))-induced prolactinoma formation. Nonetheless, E(2) treatment for 60 days also induces the formation of pituitary prolactin-secreting adenoma in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Evidently, the SD rat is also a good animal for prolactinoma investigations. Following E(2) implantation, prolactinomas developed in the eutopic adenohypophysis in situ and/or ectopic pituitary grafted under the renal capsule in SD rats. These observations favor the hypothesis that prolactinoma growth is the result of pathological changes in the adenohypophysis and/or hypothalamus. In the latter case, abnormal release of hypothalamic dopamine, GABA, or brain-gut peptides (such as cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, galanin, angiotensin, opioid peptide, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, pancreatic polypeptide, and adrenocorticotropic hormone) results in some of the pathological changes that may lead to hyperprolactinemia and/or prolactinoma development. Dysregulation of prolactin synthesis and secretion may be the result of prolactin gene modulation. In E(2)-induced rat prolactinomas, prolactin mRNA contents and the expression of some proto-oncogenes, e.g. c-myc and c-ras, TGFalpha and TGFbeta1 mRNA were significantly changed. The above findings are consistent with results in human prolactinoma development. In addition, in rats abnormal expression of the prolactin gene was correlated with hypomethylated status of CpG sites in exons 1, 2 and 4 of the prolactin gene, as well as the increase in hypersensitive sites to DNase 1 in the encoding region of the prolactin gene. In E(2)-treated rats, a point mutation with a base substitution from cytidine (C) to adenine (A) was found at the -36-bp site of the proximal promoter of the prolactin gene in eutopic pituitary prolactinomas, but no change was observed in the same sequence of the prolactin gene in ectopic prolactinoma. The association of a base substitution with the hyperexpression of the prolactin gene in eutopic prolactinomas suggests that different mechanisms may mediate the formation of eutopic and ectopic prolactin-secreting tumors. Melatonin decreases the expression of the prolactin gene in vitro suggesting that this pineal hormone may be a potential anticarcinogen in vivo. It has also been shown that MT(2) (Mel(1b)) melatonin receptors are expressed in anterior pituitary cells. The use of melatonin as a preventive or therapeutic drug for prolactinomas should be further investigated. In summary, improved knowledge on tumorigenesis of prolactinomas, especially in the rat model, was noted. These E(2)-induced rat prolactinoma models would facilitate future investigations, and expected results shall be fruitful and exciting for the development of future drug designs for the prevention and/or treatment of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors.",

We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8.

The somatic mutations, recording the unique genetic cell-lineage 'history' of each proliferating normal cell, are important but remain to be investigated because of their ultra-low frequency hidden in the genetic background of heterogeneous cells. Luckily, the recent development of single-cell genomics biotechnologies enables the screening and collection of the somatic mutations, especial single nucleotide variations (SNVs), occurring in normal cells. Here, we established DSMNC: a database of somatic mutations in normal cells (http://dsmnc.big.ac.cn/), which provides most comprehensive catalogue of somatic SNVs in single cells from various normal tissues. In the current version, the database collected \u223c0.8 million SNVs accumulated in \u223c600 single normal cells (579 human cells and 39 mouse cells). The database interface supports the user-friendly capability of browsing and searching the SNVs and their annotation information.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company's submission (CS), the ERG report and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the appraisal committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T based upon the CS. In the CS, pooled evidence of two trials (a phase II trial and RECOURSE) showed that T/T resulted in a significant increase in overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78] and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.53). The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a344,032 per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of \u00a352,695 and \u00a349,392 per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively. Since the AC concluded that the most plausible ICER was \u00a349,392 per QALY gained, and that T/T meets end-of-life criteria, T/T was recommended as a cost effective use of NHS resources.",

The optimal combination of TAS-102 with other agents, as well as the mechanism of resistance to this regimen should be defined in the near future.",

The benefits of these tablets in terms of a new therapeutic option have been demonstrated. However, the manufacturer has requested healthcare professionals to help develop safety measures for the appropriate and safe use of the tablets. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the tablets in 16 patients who received the tablets at our hospital. Among the 4 evaluable patients, none achieved a complete or partial response. One patient (25.0%) had stable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines outlined in the General Rules of the Study of Colorectal Cancer (The 8th Edition). Lonsurf\u00ae is considered to be a third-line (or later) treatment. Among the 16 cases studied, Lonsurf\u00ae was used as a third-, fourth-, and fifth-line treatment in 9, 6, and 1 cases, respectively. Therefore, Grade 3 or worse toxicities were a potential concern. Despite a high incidence of Grade 3 or worse neutropenia (7 of the 16 patients [43.8%]), none of the patients were hospitalized due to neutropenia or other treatment-related adverse events. Pharmacists have made 126 proposals to physicians regarding the use of Lonsurf\u00ae, 121 (96.0%) of which have been adopted. All of the adverse reactions experienced by our patients were resolved after supportive therapy.",

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The present study aimed to investigate the role of EGCG in Hcy-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and its underlying mechanism. We also explored the roles of rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in this process. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were treated with different drugs for different periods. The proliferation rate of HASMCs was detected using the CCK-8 and BrdU labeling assays. The Western blot assay was used to determine the expression levels of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT-1R), ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK. Compared with the control group, the HASMCs treated with Hcy at different doses (100, 200, 500, and 1000 \u00b5M) showed significantly increased proliferation. Hcy increased the expression of AT-1R, whereas EGCG decreased the protein expression of AT-1R. Furthermore, we found that Hcy-induced expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-p38MAPK was dependent on AT-1R. Compared with Hcy (500 \u00b5M)-treated cells, EGCG (20 \u00b5M)-treated cells showed decreased proliferation as well as expression of AT-1R, p-ERK1/2, and p-p38MAPK. In addition, HASMC proliferation was suppressed by the addition of an AT-1R blocker (olmesartan), an ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059), and a p38MAPK inhibitor (SB202190). EGCG can inhibit AT-1R and affect ERK1/2 and p38MAPK signaling pathways, resulting in the decrease of VSMC proliferation induced by Hcy.",

At the end of 30 days, EGCG administration to the aged animals showed significant (P &lt; 0.001) reduction of low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, total cholesterol with concomitant increase of high-density lipoprotein (P &lt; 0.001) when compared with aged rats. Increased (P &lt; 0.001) heart volume, weight with concomitant increase of left ventricular wall thickness, and reduced ventricular cavity were observed in aged rats supplemented with EGCG compared with aged animals. Histology and histomorphometry study of aged animals treated with EGCG showed marked increases in the diameter and volume of cardiomyocytes with concomitant reduction of numerical density when compared with aged animals. Reduced reactive oxygen species (P &lt; 0.001) production with association of increased antioxidant defense system (P &lt; 0.001) in aged hearts supplemented with EGCG when compared with aged animals. TUNEL staining and fibrosis showed a marked increase in apoptotic cell death (P &lt; 0.001) and collagen deposition (P &lt; 0.001) in aged animals treated with EGCG when compared with aged animals.

Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), one of the active compounds in green tea, has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and vascular protective properties. This study was designed to determine whether chronic infusion of EGCG into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuates ROS and sympathetic activity and delays the progression of hypertension by up-regulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and decreasing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activity, as well as restoring the neurotransmitters balance in the PVN of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Adult normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR received bilateral PVN infusion of EGCG (20\u03bcg/h) or vehicle via osmotic minipumps for 4 weeks. SHR showed higher mean arterial pressure, plasma proinflammatory cytokines and circulating norepinephrine (NE) levels compared with WKY rats. SHR also had higher PVN levels of the subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase (gp91<sup>phox</sup>), ROS, tyrosine hydroxylase, and PICs; increased NF-\u03baB activity; and lower PVN levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and 67kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67) than WKY rats. PVN infusion of EGCG attenuated all these changes in SHR. These findings suggest that SHR have an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, as well as an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the PVN. Chronic inhibition of ROS in the PVN restores the balance of neurotransmitters and cytokines in the PVN, thereby attenuating hypertensive response and sympathetic activity.",

Brain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancer patients usually constitute the first site of recurrence. The administration of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, considerably delays the onset of symptomatic brain disease: however, the limited penetration of these compounds into the CNS hinders their efficacy. The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptors family have established activity in HER2-positive breast cancer in both advanced disease and neoadjuvant setting. Favorable physico-chemical properties of these compounds allow them for a more efficient penetration through the blood-brain barrier, and hold the promise for more effective prevention and treatment of brain metastases.

In this non-randomised, open-label, phase 1b trial done in five sites in the USA, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive progressive breast cancer who had been previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine. Eligible patients required HER2-positivity assessed locally, evaluable lesions as defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Tucatinib was administered twice a day in conjunction with capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice a day for 14 days of a 21-day cycle, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg intravenously once every 21 days, or both. A modified 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, starting with tucatinib in combination with capecitabine or trastuzumab, and subsequently evaluating the triplet combination. The primary endpoint was to establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of tucatinib, evaluated by toxicity assessments.

Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there was no drug-drug interaction with capecitabine. Adverse events seen at the recommended phase 2 dose regardless of causality, grade, and treatment group included diarrhoea (35 [67%] of 52 patients), nausea (31 [60%] patients), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (23 [44%] patients), fatigue (20 [38%] patients), and vomiting (20 [38%] patients). In all patients, treatment-related toxicities of grade 3 and worse included fatigue (five [8%] patients), diarrhoea (four [7%] patients), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (four [7%] patients). No treatment-related deaths were reported. The proportion of patients with measurable disease achieving objective response was 83% (five of six patients) in the combination of tucatinib with capecitabine, 40% (six of 15 patients) in the combination of tucatinib with trastuzumab, and 61% (14 of 23 patients) in the combination of tucatinib with both capecitabine and trastuzumab.

The advent of HER2-directed therapy resulted in greatly improved survival outcomes, but unfortunately at the price of an increased cumulative incidence of BCBM. We review challenges in the management of BCBM, and potential treatment strategies, including novel agents such as poly-adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (olaparib, veliparib), cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors (palbociclib, abemaciclib), and taxane derivatives (eg, ANG1005 and TPI-287).

Crizotinib was the first ALK inhibitor approved and utilised in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the second line setting first and subsequently in the first line one. Since then many other ALK inhibitors have been developed (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib,etc) and the treatment paradigm of these patients has considerably drifted. The questions regarding their treatment at progression remains unanswered at the moment. Our review clarifies what it is the state of the art in the treatment of ALK rearranged NSCLC patients, highlights the mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance mutations and suggests a treatment algorithm based on specific primary resistance or acquired mutations. Studies that enrolled ALK+ NSCLC patients with locally advance or metastatic disease receiving treatment with ALK inhibitor, first or second line, were identified using electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library). Trials were excluded if they were phase 1, enrolled less than 10 patients. Overall 1942 patients were included in our review. It confirms the role and the efficacy in first line of Alectinib but it highlights also that all the ALK inhibitors could play a crucial role during the patients' journey. Identifying the different mutations and utilising the most active ALK inhibitor depending on the \"up-to-date\" driven mutation is the way forward in the management of those patients. the review shows the rapid drifting in the management of ALK+ NSCLC patients and the importance of fully understanding and acknowledging the role of the resistance mutation, primary or acquired.

We monitored the plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using captured-based ultra-deep sequencing analysis of one patient with metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC who had received therapies including first-, second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors. Functional in vitro studies were further undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of resistance. ALK T1151Sins mutation was detected when the patient developed resistance to ceritinib, and undetectable when she responded to lorlatinib. MET amplification was present when the tumor developed resistance to lorlatinib, and reduced when the patient received combination therapy of lorlatinib with crizotinib, which corresponded to clinical radiologic responses. In addition, further functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ALK harboring the T1151Sins mutation, while conferring resistance to ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib.

However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v 0%; P &lt; .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R ( P = .010 and .015, respectively).

Patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline by independent central review were included in the intracranial activity analyses. In this report, we present lorlatinib activity data for the ALK-positive patients (EXP1-5 only), and safety data for all treated patients (EXP1-6). This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01970865\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01970865</a>. Between Sept 15, 2015, and Oct 3, 2016, 276 patients were enrolled: 30 who were ALK positive and treatment naive (EXP1); 59 who were ALK positive and received previous crizotinib without (n=27; EXP2) or with (n=32; EXP3A) previous chemotherapy; 28 who were ALK positive and received one previous non-crizotinib ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with or without chemotherapy (EXP3B); 112 who were ALK positive with two (n=66; EXP4) or three (n=46; EXP5) previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors with or without chemotherapy; and 47 who were ROS1 positive with any previous treatment (EXP6). One patient in EXP4 died before receiving lorlatinib and was excluded from the safety analysis set. In treatment-naive patients (EXP1), an objective response was achieved in 27 (90\u00b70%; 95% CI 73\u00b75-97\u00b79) of 30 patients. Three patients in EXP1 had measurable baseline CNS lesions per independent central review, and objective intracranial responses were observed in two (66\u00b77%; 95% CI 9\u00b74-99\u00b72). In ALK-positive patients with at least one previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EXP2-5), objective responses were achieved in 93 (47\u00b70%; 39\u00b79-54\u00b72) of 198 patients and objective intracranial response in those with measurable baseline CNS lesions in 51 (63\u00b70%; 51\u00b75-73\u00b74) of 81 patients. Objective response was achieved in 41 (69\u00b75%; 95% CI 56\u00b71-80\u00b78) of 59 patients who had only received previous crizotinib (EXP2-3A), nine (32\u00b71%; 15\u00b79-52\u00b74) of 28 patients with one previous non-crizotinib ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EXP3B), and 43 (38\u00b77%; 29\u00b76-48\u00b75) of 111 patients with two or more previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EXP4-5). Objective intracranial response was achieved in 20 (87\u00b70%; 95% CI 66\u00b74-97\u00b72) of 23 patients with measurable baseline CNS lesions in EXP2-3A, five (55\u00b76%; 21\u00b72-86\u00b73) of nine patients in EXP3B, and 26 (53\u00b71%; 38\u00b73-67\u00b75) of 49 patients in EXP4-5. The most common treatment-related adverse events across all patients were hypercholesterolaemia (224 [81%] of 275 patients overall and 43 [16%] grade 3-4) and hypertriglyceridaemia (166 [60%] overall and 43 [16%] grade 3-4). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 (7%) of 275 patients and seven patients (3%) permanently discontinued treatment because of treatment-related adverse events. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Consistent with its broad ALK mutational coverage and CNS penetration, lorlatinib showed substantial overall and intracranial activity both in treatment-naive patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, and in those who had progressed on crizotinib, second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or after up to three previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, lorlatinib could represent an effective treatment option for patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer in first-line or subsequent therapy. Pfizer.",

Targeting ALK using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with <i>ALK</i>-rearranged NSCLC. However, most patients relapse on ALK-TKI therapy within a few years because of acquired resistance. One mechanism of acquiring resistance is a second mutation on the <i>ALK</i> gene, and the representative mutation is L1996M in the gatekeeper residue. In particular, the solvent-front <i>ALK</i> G1202R mutation is the common cause of resistance against first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. Another major concern regarding ALK-TKI is metastasis to the central nervous system, commonly observed in patients relapsing after ALK-TKI therapy. The next-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib (PF-06463922) has therefore been developed to inhibit resistant <i>ALK</i> mutations, including <i>ALK</i> G1202R, and to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In a Phase I/II trial, the safety and efficacy of lorlatinib were demonstrated in patients with advanced <i>ALK</i>-positive NSCLC, most of whom had central nervous system metastases and had previous ALK-TKI treatment. In this review, we discuss the structure, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of lorlatinib and compare its characteristics with those of other ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, clinical trials for lorlatinib are summarized, and future perspectives in the management of patients with <i>ALK</i>-rearranged NSCLC are discussed.",

A proper inflammatory response ensures the suitable resolution of inflammation and elimination of harmful stimuli, but when the inflammatory reactions are inappropriate it can lead to damage of the surrounding normal cells. The relationship between infections and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) etiology, especially lateonset AD (LOAD) has been continuously debated over the past three decades. This review discusses whether infections could be a causative factor that promotes the progression of AD and summarizes recent investigations associating infectious agents and chronic inflammation with AD. Preventive and therapeutic approaches to AD in the context of an infectious etiology of the disease are also discussed. Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis of the role of neurotropic viruses from the Herpesviridae family, especially Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Human herpesvirus 2 (HHV-2), in AD neuropathology. Recent investigations also indicate the association between Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and dementia. Among bacteria special attention is focused on spirochetes family and on periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis or Treponema denticola that could cause chronic periodontitis and possibly contribute to the clinical onset of AD. Chronic viral, bacterial and fungal infections might be causative factors for the inflammatory pathway in AD.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29249963": "Longitudinal monitoring of patients suggests a causal link between chronic periodontitis and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the explanation of how periodontitis can lead to dementia remains unclear. A working hypothesis links extrinsic inflammation as a secondary cause of AD. This hypothesis suggests a compromised oral hygiene leads to a dysbiotic oral microbiome whereby <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>, a keystone periodontal pathogen, with its companion species, orchestrates immune subversion in the host. Brushing and chewing on teeth supported by already injured soft tissues leads to bacteremias. As a result, a persistent systemic inflammatory response develops to periodontal pathogens. The pathogens, and the host's inflammatory response, subsequently lead to the initiation and progression of multiple metabolic and inflammatory co-morbidities, including AD. Insufficient levels of essential micronutrients can lead to microbial dysbiosis through the growth of periodontal pathogens such as demonstrated for <i>P. gingivalis</i> under low hemin bioavailability. An individual's diet also defines the consortium of microbial communities that take up residency in the oral and gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiomes. Their imbalance can lead to behavioral changes. For example, probiotics enriched in <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus of bacteria, when ingested, exert some anti-inflammatory influence through common host/bacterial neurochemicals, both locally, and through sensory signaling back to the brain. Early life dietary behaviors may cause an imbalance in the host/microbial endocrinology through a dietary intake incompatible with a healthy GI tract microbiome later in life. This imbalance in host/microbial endocrinology may have a lasting impact on mental health. This observation opens up an opportunity to explore the mechanisms, which may underlie the previously detected relationship between diet, oral/GI microbial communities, to anxiety, cognition and sleep patterns. This review suggests healthy diet based interventions that together with improved life style/behavioral changes may reduce and/or delay the incidence of AD.",

Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life.",

In order to test if protein levels of GTF2H5 are associated with patients' outcome, we performed GTF2H5 immunohistochemical staining in 139 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas included in tissue microarrays. Upon stratification of cases into high- and low-GTF2H5 staining categories (&gt; and \u2264 median staining, respectively) Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were used to estimate patients' survival and assess statistical differences. We also evaluated the association of GTF2H5 with survival at the transcriptional level by using the on-line Kaplan-Meier plotter tool, which includes gene expression and survival data of 855 high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients from 13 different datasets. Finally, we determined whether stable short hairpin RNA-mediated GTF2H5 downregulation modulates cisplatin sensitivity in the SKOV3 and COV504 cell lines by using cytotoxicity assays. Low expression of GTF2H5 was associated with longer 5-year survival of patients at the protein (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.93; p=0.024) and transcriptional level (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; p=0.023) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.

GTF2H5-silencing induced a decrease of the half maximal inhibitory concentration upon cisplatin treatment in GTF2H5-silenced ovarian cancer cells. Low levels of GTF2H5 are associated with enhanced prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients and may contribute to cisplatin sensitization.",

There has not been any effective treatment for this infectious disease. Cholera toxin (CT), which is secreted by V. cholerae, can enter host cells by binding to GM1, a monosialoganglioside widely distributed on the plasma membrane surface of various animal epithelial cells. The present study was undertaken to generate peptides that are conformationally similar to the carbohydrate epitope of GM1 for use in the treatment of cholera and related bacterial infection. For this purpose, we used cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit to select CTB-binding peptides that structurally mimic GM1 from a dodecamer phage-display library. Six GM1-replica peptides were selected by biopanning based on CTB recognition. Five of the six peptides showed inhibitory activity for GM1 binding to CTB. To test the potential of employing the peptide mimics for intervening with the bacterial infection, those peptides were examined for their binding capacity, functional inhibitory activity and in vitro effects using a human intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco-2 cells. One of the peptides, P3 (IPQVWRDWFKLP), was most effective in inhibiting cellular uptake of CTB and suppressing CT-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate production in the cells. Our results thus provide convincing evidence that GM1-replica peptides could serve as novel agents to block CTB binding on epithelial cells and prevent the ensuing physiological effects of CT.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26478842": "The five B-subunits (CTB5) of the Vibrio cholerae (cholera) toxin can bind to the intestinal cell surface so the entire AB5 toxin can enter the cell. Simultaneous binding can occur on more than one of the monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) units present on the cell surface. Such simultaneous binding arising from the toxins multivalency is believed to enhance its affinity. Thus, blocking the initial attachment of the toxin to the cell surface using inhibitors with GM1 subunits has the potential to stop the disease. Previously we showed that tetravalent GM1 molecules were sub-nanomolar inhibitors of CTB5. In this study, we synthesized a pentavalent version and compared the binding and potency of penta- and tetravalent cholera toxin inhibitors, based on the same scaffold, for the first time. The pentavalent geometry did not yield major benefits over the tetravalent species, but it was still a strong inhibitor, and no major steric clashes occurred when binding the toxin. Thus, systems which can adopt more geometries, such as those described here, can be equally potent, and this may possibly be due to their ability to form higher-order structures or simply due to more statistical options for binding.",

However, the mechanisms governing stabilized raft assembly and function remain unclear. Here, we test the role of glycolipid crosslinking as a raft targeting and ordering mechanism using the well-studied raft marker cholera toxin B pentamer (CTxB) that binds up to five GM1 glycosphingolipids to enter host cells. We show that when applied to cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles, a variant of CTxB containing only a single functional GM1 binding site exhibits significantly reduced partitioning to the ordered phase compared to wild-type CTxB with five binding sites. Moreover, monovalent CTxB does not stabilize membrane domains, unlike wild-type CTxB. These results support the long-held hypothesis that CTxB stabilizes raft domains via a lipid crosslinking mechanism and establish a role for crosslinking in the partitioning of CTxB to ordered domains.",

Single-dose duvelisib was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum concentration, 1-2 hours), with a half-life of 5.2 to 10.9 hours. PD results showed inhibition of phospho-AKT (S473) in CLL tumor cells following a single dose and near-complete inhibition of CLL proliferation (Ki-67) by cycle 2. Clinical responses were seen across a range of doses and disease subtypes: iNHL overall response rate, 58% (n = 31) with 6 complete responses (CRs); relapsed/refractory CLL, 56% (n = 55) with 1 CR; peripheral TCL, 50% (n = 16) with 3 CR; and cutaneous TCL, 32% (n = 19). Median time to response was \u223c1.8 months. Severe (grade \u22653) adverse events occurred in 84% of patients: neutropenia (32%), alanine transaminase increase (20%), aspartate transaminase increase (15%), anemia and thrombocytopenia (each 14%), diarrhea (11%), and pneumonia (10%).

While the PI3K\u03b4-specific inhibitor idelalisib shows efficacy in treatment of CLL and other B cell malignancies, the function of PI3K\u03b3 has not been extensively studied in B cells. Here, we assess whether PI3K\u03b3 has non-redundant functions in CLL migration and adhesion to stromal cells. We observed that pharmaceutical PI3K\u03b3 inhibition with CZC24832 significantly impaired CLL cell migration, while dual PI3K\u03b4/\u03b3 inhibitor duvelisib had a greater impact than single isoform-selective inhibitors. Knockdown of PI3K\u03b3 reduced migration of CLL cells and cell lines. Expression of the PI3K\u03b3 subunits increased in CLL cells in response to CD40L/IL-4, whereas BCR cross-linking had no effect. Overexpression of PI3K\u03b3 subunits enhanced cell migration in response to SDF1\u03b1/CXCL12, with the strongest effect observed within ZAP70 + CLL samples. Microscopic tracking of cell migration within chemokine gradients revealed that PI3K\u03b3 functions in gradient sensing and impacts cell morphology and F-actin polarization. PI3K\u03b3 inhibition also reduced CLL adhesion to stromal cells to a similar extent as idelalisib.

Previous studies have shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is activated in EBV-associated lymphomas and can be a novel therapeutic target. An oral dual inhibitor of PI3K\u03b3 and PI3K\u03b4, duvelisib, is in clinical trials for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. In this study, we evaluated how duvelisib affects the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and if it has antitumor effects in EBV-associated lymphoma cell lines. We found that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was activated in most of the B and T cell lymphoma cell lines tested. Additionally, duvelisib treatment inhibited cellular growth in the tested cell lines. Overall, B cell lines were more susceptible to duvelisib than T and NK cell lines in vitro regardless of EBV infection. However, the additional influence of duvelisib on the tumor microenvironment was not assessed. Duvelisib treatment induced both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in EBV-positive and -negative B cell lines, but not in T cell lines. Furthermore, duvelisib treatment reduced the expression of EBV lytic genes (BZLF1 and gp350/220) in EBV-positive B cell lines, suggesting that duvelisib suppresses the lytic cycle of EBV induced by B cell receptor signaling. However, duvelisib did not induce a remarkable change in the expression of EBV latent genes. These results may indicate that there is therapeutic potential for duvelisib administration in the treatment of EBV-associated B cell lymphomas and other B cell malignancies.",

Further, prognostic factors, cytogenetic anomalies, and compensatory cellular signaling lead to therapy resistance or disease relapse. Therefore, for the past few years, development of targeted therapies is on the rise. PI3K is a major player in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling axis, which is critical for the survival and maintenance of B cells. Duvelisib, a PI3K \u03b4/\u03b3 dual isoform specific inhibitor that induces apoptosis and reduces cytokine and chemokine levels in vitro, holds promise for CLL. Areas covered: Herein, we review PI3K isoforms and their inhibitors in general, and duvelisib in particular; examine literature on preclinical investigations, pharmacokinetics and clinical studies of duvelisib either as single agent or in combination, for patients with CLL and other lymphoid malignancies. Expert opinion: Duvelisib targets the PI3K \u03b4 isoform, which is necessary for cell proliferation and survival, and \u03b3 isoform, which is critical for cytokine signaling and pro-inflammatory responses from the microenvironment. In phase I clinical trials, duvelisib as a single agent showed promise for CLL and other lymphoid malignancies.

It generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, which provides a membrane docking site for protein kinaseB activation. PI3K catalytic p110 subunits are divided into 4 isoforms; \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b4 and \u03b3. The PI3K\u03b4 isoform is always expressed in AML cells, whereas the frequency of PI3K\u03b3 expression is highly variable. The functions of these individual catalytic enzymes have not been fully resolved in AML, therefore using the PI3K p110\u03b4 and p110\u03b3-targeted inhibitor IPI-145 (duvelisib) and specific p110\u03b4 and p110\u03b3 shRNA, we analysed the role of these two p110 subunits in human AML blast survival. The results show that PI3K\u03b4 and PI3K\u03b3 inhibition with IPI-145 has anti-proliferative activity in primary AML cells by inhibiting the activity of AKT and MAPK. Pre-treatment of AML cells with IPI-145 inhibits both adhesion and migration of AML blasts to bone marrow stromal cells. Using shRNA targeted to the individual isoforms we demonstrated that p110\u03b4-knockdown had a more significant anti-proliferative effect on AML cells, whereas targeting p110\u03b3-knockdown significantly inhibited AML migration. The results demonstrate that targeting both PI3K\u03b4 and PI3K\u03b3 to inhibit AML-BMSC interactions provides a biologic rationale for the pre-clinical evaluation of IPI-145 in AML.",

To identify novel pairings for duvelisib in HM, it was evaluated alone and in combination with 35 compounds comprising a diverse panel of standard-of-care agents and emerging drugs in development for HM. These compounds were tested in 20 cell lines including diffuse large B-cell, follicular, T-cell, and mantle cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. Single agent activity was seen in fourteen cell lines, with a median GI50 of 0.59 \u03bcM. A scalar measure of the strength of synergistic drug interactions revealed a synergy hit rate of 19.3% across the matrix of drug combinations and cell lines. Synergy with duvelisib was prominent in lymphoma lines with approved and emerging drugs used to treat HM, including dexamethasone, ibrutinib, and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Western blotting revealed that certain duvelisib-treated cell lines showed inhibition of phosphorylated (p) AKT at serine 473 only out to 12 hours, with mTORC2 dependent re-phosphorylation of pAKT evident at 24 hours. Combination with dexamethasone or ibrutinib, however, prevented this reactivation leading to durable inhibition of pAKT. The combination treatments also inhibited downstream signaling effectors pPRAS40 and pS6. The combination of duvelisib with dexamethasone also significantly reduced p-4EBP1, which controls cap dependent translation initiation, leading to decreased levels of c-MYC 6 hours after treatment. In support of the in vitro studies, in vivo xenograft studies revealed that duvelisib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus led to greater tumor growth inhibition compared to single agent administration. These data provide a rationale for exploring multiple combinations in the clinic and suggest that suppression of mTOR-driven survival signaling may be one important mechanism for combination synergy.",

To characterize the molecular effect of duvelisib, we obtained samples from CLL patients on the duvelisib phase I trial. Gene expression studies (RNAseq, Nanostring, Affymetrix array and real-time RT-PCR) demonstrated increased expression of BCL2 along with several BH3-only pro-apoptotic genes.

The purely PI3K-\u03b4-selective inhibitor idelalisib was compared to copanlisib (BAY 80-6946) and duvelisib (IPI-145), with isoform target profiles that additionally include PI3K-\u03b1 or PI3K-\u03b3, respectively. The concentrations leading to half-maximal reduction of the survival of CLL cells were more than ten-fold lower for copanlisib than for idelalisib and duvelisib. At concentrations reflecting the biological availability of the different inhibitors, high levels of apoptotic response among CLL samples were attained more consistently with copanlisib than with idelalisib. Copanlisib selectively reduced the survival of CLL cells compared to T cells and to B cells from healthy donors. In addition copanlisib and duvelisib impaired the migration of CLL cells towards CXCL12 to a greater extent than equimolar idelalisib. Similarly copanlisib and duvelisib reduced the survival of CLL cells in co-cultures with the bone marrow stroma cell line HS-5 more strongly than idelalisib. Survival inhibition by copanlisib and idelalisib was enhanced by the monoclonal CD20 antibodies rituximab and obinutuzumab (GA101), while antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by alemtuzumab and peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not substantially impaired by both PI3K inhibitors for the CLL-derived JVM-3 cell line as target cells.

However, most of the analytical methods are based on the identification of reliable peptides and not the direct identification of intact proteins. Thus, assembling peptides identified from tandem mass spectra into a list of proteins, referred to as protein inference, is a critical step in proteomics research. Currently, different protein inference algorithms and tools are available for the proteomics community. Here, we evaluated five software tools for protein inference (PIA, ProteinProphet, Fido, ProteinLP, MSBayesPro) using three popular database search engines: Mascot, X!Tandem, and MS-GF+. All the algorithms were evaluated using a highly customizable KNIME workflow using four different public datasets with varying complexities (different sample preparation, species and analytical instruments). We defined a set of quality control metrics to evaluate the performance of each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithm, and parameters on each dataset. We show that the results for complex samples vary not only regarding the actual numbers of reported protein groups but also concerning the actual composition of groups. Furthermore, the robustness of reported proteins when using databases of differing complexities is strongly dependant on the applied inference algorithm. Finally, merging the identifications of multiple search engines does not necessarily increase the number of reported proteins, but does increase the number of peptides per protein and thus can generally be recommended. Protein inference is one of the major challenges in MS-based proteomics nowadays. Currently, there are a vast number of protein inference algorithms and implementations available for the proteomics community. Protein assembly impacts in the final results of the research, the quantitation values and the final claims in the research manuscript.

This manuscript presents a new bioinformatics solution based on the KNIME/OpenMS platform that aims at providing a fair comparison of protein inference algorithms (https://github.com/KNIME-OMICS). Six different algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total &gt;186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying the results of the analyzed workflow, regarding not only the reported proteins and the high-quality identifications, but also the required runtime. 2) Merging the identifications of multiple search engines gives almost always more confident results and increases the number of peptides per protein group. 3) The usage of databases containing not only the canonical, but also known isoforms of proteins has a small impact on the number of reported proteins. The detection of specific isoforms could, concerning the question behind the study, compensate for slightly shorter reports using the parsimonious reports. 4) The current workflow can be easily extended to support new algorithms and search engine combinations.",

The rationale for a combined molecule is to block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between tumor cells and immune cell infiltrate and simultaneously reduce or eliminate TGF\u03b2 from the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explored the effect of M7824 on invasive urothelial carcinoma cell lines. Human urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma cell lines HTB-4, HTB-1, and HTB-5 were treated with M7824, M7824mut (M7824 that is mutated in the anti-PD-L1 portion of the molecule and thus does not bind PD-L1), anti-PD-L1 (avelumab), or IgG1 isotype control monoclonal antibody, and were assessed for gene expression, cell-surface phenotype, and sensitivity to lysis by TRAIL, antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. M7824 retains the ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells, although in some cases to a lesser extent than anti-PD-L1. However, compared to anti-PD-L1, M7824 increases (A) gene expression of molecules involved in T-cell trafficking in the tumor (e.g., CXCL11), (B) TRAIL-mediated tumor cell lysis, and (C) antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated lysis of tumor cells. These studies demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of M7824 on both tumor cell phenotype and immune-mediated lysis. Compared to anti-PD-L1 or M7824mut, M7824 induces immunogenic modulation of urothelial carcinoma cell lines, rendering them more susceptible to immune-mediated recognition and lysis.

Similarly, before the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy. In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy. For that matter, we undertook a literature review of all the studies assessing the pharmacology of avelumab and its efficacy within clinical trials. Expert commentary: Avelumab has shown promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with UC. Its dual mechanism of action, blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity could potentially be of great interest since it could produce synergistic clinical efficacy.",

The first immunotherapy was the live, attenuated bacterial Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine, which has been the standard of care non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer since 1990. Modern immunotherapy has focused on inhibitors of checkpoint proteins, which are molecules that impede immune function, thereby allowing tumor cells to grow and proliferate unregulated. Several checkpoint targets (programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1] programmed cell death protien-1 [PD-1], and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 [CTLA4]) have received the most attention in the treatment of bladder cancer, and have inhibitor agents either approved or in late-stage development. This review describes the most recent data on agents that inhibit PD-L1, found on the surface of tumor cells, and PD-1 found on activated T and B cells and macrophages. Atezolizumab is the only member of this class currently approved for the treatment of bladder cancer, but nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab all have positive results for this indication, and approvals are anticipated in the near future. The checkpoint inhibitors offer an effective alternative for patients for whom previously there were few options for durable responses, including those who are ineligible for cisplatin-based regimens or who are at risk of significant toxicity. Research is ongoing to further categorize responses, define ideal patient populations, and investigate combinations of checkpoint inhibitors to address multiple pathways in immune system functioning.",

Long-term survival remains stagnant around 12-14 months for patients with advanced disease who have progressed on or recurred after receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Improving clinical outcomes for patients with urothelial carcinoma in all disease settings requires the development of novel treatments, especially for patients who failed on first-line chemotherapy. Since the discovery of intravesical Bacillus-Calmette Guerin (BCG) in the 1970s for non-muscle invasive disease, there have not been any major breakthrough drugs that exploit the immune-sensitivity of bladder cancer until recently. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed death 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathways have shown significant anti-tumor activity, tolerable safety profiles and durable, long-term responses in clinical trials. Atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab are promising PD-1/PD-L1 blockade drugs under investigation that will redefine the standard of care for bladder cancer. CTLA-4 inhibitors are also under investigation in this setting. Atezolizumab, approved in May 2016, and nivolumab, approved in February 2017, are the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immune-checkpoint inhibitors in bladder cancer for platinum-pretreated patients based on phase II data. On March 16, 2017, results from the phase III trial KEYNOTE-045 demonstrated that survival was significantly longer in patients treated with pembrolizumab when compared with the standard second-line chemotherapy. Research into biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, messenger RNA subtype, mutational and neoantigen load and gene signature expression will be crucial to determining why some patients respond to immunotherapy and others do not. This review article describes the advances in immunotherapy since the development of BCG, presents results from clinical trials investigating immune-checkpoint inhibitors and discusses biomarkers and prognostic factors associated with response to these new drugs.",

In the USA, it is the fifth most common cancer and approximately 79,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 2017 (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). The mortality from bladder cancer is approximately 17,000 deaths each year (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). The incidence rate for bladder cancer is higher in men compared to women. Risk factors are predominantly related to tobacco smoking, although infection with Schistosoma haematobium is another risk factor in selected populations (Antoni et al. in Eur Urol, 71:96-108, 2017). Cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy regimens remain the standard of care in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; De Santis et al. in J Clin Oncol, 30:191-199, 2012; Bellmunt et al. in J Clin Oncol, 27: 4454-4461, 2009). There is an estimated overall survival of 9-15 months in metastatic bladder cancer in those who receive the standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy (Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; De Santis et al. in J Clin Oncol, 30:191-199, 2012). The median survival, however, is significantly reduced after relapse in patient treated with platinum chemotherapy to less than 7 months (Bellmunt et al. in J Clin Oncol, 27: 4454-4461, 2009). Thus, this approach is preferred for patients who can tolerate this treatment as first-line chemotherapy (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017). Until recently, there were few treatment options for those patients with poor performance status who are ineligible to receive cisplatin including renal insufficiency and multiple comorbidities or had disease progression after receiving platinum-based chemotherapy (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017). With further understanding of tumor immune evasion, systemic immunotherapy which utilizes the patient's own immune system directly to eradicate and target neoplastic cells, has now been approved for urothelial bladder cancer. Monoclonal antibodies that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), including Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, and its ligand, PD-L1, including Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, Avelumab, have all been investigated and approved in the setting of metastatic refractory urothelial cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; Zilchi et al. in BioMed Res Int, 2017, 2017, doi: 10.1155/2017/5618174 ).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28862760": "Aberrant c-Met activity has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that c-Met inhibition may have therapeutic potential. However, clinical trials of nonselective kinase inhibitors with c-Met activity (tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and golvatinib) in patients with HCC have failed so far to demonstrate significant efficacy. This lack of observed efficacy is likely due to several factors, including trial design, lack of patient selection according to tumor c-Met status, and the prevalent off-target activity of these agents, which may indicate that c-Met inhibition is incomplete. In contrast, selective c-Met inhibitors (tepotinib, capmatinib) can be dosed at a level predicted to achieve complete inhibition of tumor c-Met activity. Moreover, results from early trials can be used to optimize the design of clinical trials of these agents. Preliminary results suggest that selective c-Met inhibitors have antitumor activity in HCC, with acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with Child-Pugh A liver function. Ongoing trials have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of selective c-Met inhibition compared with standard therapy in patients with HCC that were selected based on tumor c-Met status. Thus, c-Met inhibition continues to be an active area of research in HCC, with well-designed trials in progress to investigate the benefit of selective c-Met inhibitors.

On the basis of the results of two pivotal Phase III placebo-controlled studies, sorafenib is currently acknowledged worldwide as the standard therapeutic agent for advanced HCC. Following the introduction of sorafenib for the treatment of HCC, Phase III trials of numerous other agents as first-line or second-line chemotherapy have been conducted to determine if any of these agents might offer superior survival benefit to sorafenib. In 2016, a clear survival benefit of regorafenib over placebo was demonstrated in HCC patients showing disease progression after sorafenib treatment. A year later, in 2017, lenvatinib has been shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib, in terms of the overall survival, in chemo-na\u00efve patients with advanced HCC. More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib. At present, various novel combination regimens including these agents are currently under development. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is frequently adopted for the treatment of locally advanced HCC in Japan, based on reports of high response rates and favorable long-term outcomes. Although some randomized controlled trials of HAIC plus sorafenib vs. sorafenib alone as first-line therapy have been conducted in patients with advanced HCC, no firm evidence of the superiority of one over the other has been established yet. In the future, demonstration of the survival advantage of HAIC and the recognition of HAIC as one of the standard treatments for patients with advanced HCC are expected.",

Treating HCC and designing clinical trials are particularly challenging because co-existing liver disease, present in most patients, limits aggressive therapeutic options. Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities. However, failure of several large randomised controlled clinical trials over the last 10 years underlines the necessity for innovative treatment strategies and implementation of translational findings to overcome the unmet clinical need. Furthermore, the promising results from novel immunotherapies are likely to complement the landscape of active compounds for HCC and will require a completely different approach to patients, as well as the development of prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Given our increasing understanding of the most abundant molecular alterations in HCC, effective enrichment of patients based on clinical and molecular biomarkers, as well as adaptive clinical trials, are now feasible and should be implemented.

A key recommendation in the management of patients receiving sorafenib is to promote close communication between the patient and the physician so that adverse events (AEs) are detected early and severe AEs can be prevented. Sorafenib-related AEs have been identified as clinical biomarkers for sorafenib efficacy. Healthcare professionals have become more efficient in managing AEs, identifying patients who are likely to benefit from treatment, and assessing response to treatment, resulting in a trend towards increased overall survival in the sorafenib arms of clinical studies. The rapidly changing treatment landscape due to the emergence of new treatment options (sorafenib and lenvatinib equally effective in first line; regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab showing OS benefit in second line with nivolumab approved by the FDA based on response rate) underscores the importance of re-assessing the role of the first approved systemic agent in HCC, sorafenib.",

A total of 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients had received previous treatment with sorafenib, had disease progression after at least one systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, and may have received up to two previous systemic regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and the objective response rate. At the second planned interim analysis, the trial showed significantly longer overall survival with cabozantinib than with placebo. Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005).

Careful evaluation of the clinical trials for approved systemic treatments of HCC is crucial when considering the best options for those with HCC recurrence after LT. Although several first-line or second-line treatments have been shown to be effective for HCC, each of these trials was composed of its own specific populations, and those with HCC recurrence after LT were excluded.

Recent prospective and retrospective studies supported the usefulness of platinum agents as a chemotherapeutic at the time of varied TACE therapy. Although balloon-occluded TACE is an effective therapy for localized HCC and drug-eluting microspheres seemed to show a higher response rate in certain HCCs, the definite advantages of those procedures still remain uncertain.

However, the precise role of BCL11B in humans is largely unexplored, except for a single patient with a BCL11B missense mutation, affected by multisystem anomalies and profound immune deficiency. Using massively parallel sequencing we identified 13 patients bearing heterozygous germline alterations in BCL11B. Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes.",

We investigated expression of TLR8 on MDSC and the effect of a TLR8 agonist, motolimod, on MDSC survival and function. TLR8 was highly expressed in monocytic MDSC (mMDSC) but absent in granulocytic MDSC (gMDSC). Treatment of human PBMC with motolimod reduced the levels of mMDSC in volunteers and cancer donors versus control (P &lt; 0.001). Motolimod did not impact levels of gMDSC. The reduction of mMDSC was due to induced cell death by TLR8 ligation. Pretreatment of PBMC with a FAS neutralizing antibody inhibited motolimod-induced reduction of mMDSC (P &lt; 0.001). Finally, we demonstrated that mMDSC impeded IL-2 secretion by CD3/CD28-activated T cells; IL-2 secretion was partially restored when cells were cocultured with motolimod (142 \u00b1 36 pg/ml vs. 59 \u00b1 13 pg/ml; P = 0.03).

Patients received a maximum of 6 chemotherapy cycles, after which patients received weekly cetuximab with either placebo or motolimod every 4 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by independent central review using immune-related RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Key secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and safety. Of 195 patients enrolled, 85% were men (n = 166); 82% were white (n = 159); median age was 58 years (range 23-81 years). Median PFS was 6.1 vs 5.9 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-1.22; P = .47), and median OS was 13.5 vs 11.3 months (HR, 0.95; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-1.22; P = .40) for motolimod vs placebo. Increased incidence of injection site reactions, pyrexia, chills, anemia, and acneiform rash were noted with motolimod. Of 83 cases oropharyngeal cancer, 52 (63%) were human papillomavirus (HPV) positive. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of HPV-positive participants, motolimod vs placebo resulted in significantly longer PFS (7.8 vs 5.9 months; HR, 0.58; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.90; P = .046) and OS (15.2 vs 12.6 months; HR, 0.41; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.77; P = .03). In an exploratory analysis, patients with injection site reactions had longer PFS and OS (median PFS, 7.1 vs 5.9 months; HR, 0.69; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.93; P = .06; and median OS, 18.7 vs 12.6; HR, 0.56; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.81; P = .02). Adding motolimod to the EXTREME regimen was well tolerated but did not improve PFS or OS in the intent-to-treat population. Significant benefit was observed in HPV-positive patients and those with injection site reactions, suggesting that TLR8 stimulation may benefit subset- and biomarker-selected patients.

We sought to develop a rational combination of motolimod-a novel Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist that stimulates robust innate immune responses in humans but diminished responses in mice-with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), a chemotherapeutic that induces immunogenic cell death.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We followed an integrative pharmacologic approach including healthy human volunteers, non-human primates, NSG-HIS (\"humanized immune system\") mice reconstituted with human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and patients with cancer to test the effects of motolimod and to assess the combination of motolimod with PLD for the treatment of ovarian cancer.<b>Results:</b> The pharmacodynamic effects of motolimod monotherapy in NSG-HIS mice closely mimicked those in non-human primates and healthy human subjects, whereas the effects of the motolimod/PLD combination in tumor-bearing NSG-HIS mice closely mimicked those in patients with ovarian cancer treated in a phase Ib trial (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01294293\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01294293</a>).

Motolimod (VTX-2337), a selective small-molecule agonist of TLR8, stimulates natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes. A phase Ib clinical trial assessed the safety and antitumor activity of motolimod in combination with cetuximab in patients with SCCHN. Correlative biomarkers of immune activity were explored.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Thirteen patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN were enrolled in this open-label, dose-escalation study using a standard 3 + 3 design. Doses of motolimod (2.5, 3.0, or 3.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were given on days 1, 8, and 15, in combination with fixed weekly doses of cetuximab in 28-day cycles.<b>Results:</b> There were no protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities, drug-related deaths, or evidence of synergistic toxicities between motolimod and cetuximab.

Women with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma were randomized 1 : 1 to receive PLD in combination with blinded motolimod or placebo. Randomization was stratified by platinum-free interval (\u22646 versus &gt;6-12 months) and Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status (0 versus 1). Treatment cycles were repeated every 28 days until disease progression. The addition of motolimod to PLD did not significantly improve overall survival (OS; log rank one-sided P = 0.923, HR = 1.22) or progression-free survival (PFS; log rank one-sided P = 0.943, HR = 1.21). The combination was well tolerated, with no synergistic or unexpected serious toxicity. Most patients experienced adverse events of fatigue, anemia, nausea, decreased white blood cells, and constipation. In pre-specified subgroup analyses, motolimod-treated patients who experienced injection site reactions (ISR) had a lower risk of death compared with those who did not experience ISR. Additionally, pre-treatment in vitro responses of immune biomarkers to TLR8 stimulation predicted OS outcomes in patients receiving motolimod on study. Immune score (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; TIL), TLR8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, mutational status in BRCA and other DNA repair genes, and autoantibody biomarkers did not correlate with OS or PFS. The addition of motolimod to PLD did not improve clinical outcomes compared with placebo. However, subset analyses identified statistically significant differences in the OS of motolimod-treated patients on the basis of ISR and in vitro immune responses. Collectively, these data may provide important clues for identifying patients for treatment with immunomodulatory agents in novel combinations and/or delivery approaches.

The activity of motolimod (VTX-2337), a potent and selective Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist, was therefore assessed in the context of advanced, late-stage cancer patients. The repertoire of mediators induced from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to motolimod was characterized. Translational studies in cynomolgus monkeys elucidated the activity of motolimod on an intact immune system, identified biomarkers of TLR8 activation, and defined the relationship between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) response. The PK/PD relationship for motolimod in cancer patients was assessed, compared with preclinical findings, and contrasted with activity in healthy volunteers. In late-stage cancer patients, plasma levels of multiple biomarkers, including IL6, G-CSF, MCP-1, and MIP1-\u03b2, increased with increasing motolimod dose. The magnitude and breadth of the biomarker response closely aligned with the response seen in preclinical studies, demonstrating that advanced cancer patients remained responsive to TLR8 activation. In addition, the PK/PD response in cancer patients closely aligned with the activity of motolimod seen in healthy volunteers. Late-stage cancer patients are highly sensitive to TLR8 activation by motolimod. Tumor burden, advanced age, and prior treatment history with cytotoxic agents did not moderate or modify the response predicted by nonclinical studies and confirmed in healthy volunteers.

Activation of TLR8 enhances natural killer cell activation, increases antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and induces Th1 polarizing cytokines. Here, we show that VTX-2337 stimulates the release of mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 from monocytic cells through coordinated actions on both TLR8 and the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complex. In vitro, VTX-2337 primed monocytic cells to produce pro-IL-1\u03b2, pro-IL-18, and caspase-1, and also activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mediating the release of mature IL-1\u03b2 family cytokines. Inhibition of caspase-1 blocked VTX-2337-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but had little impact on production of other TLR8-induced mediators such as TNF\u03b1. IL-18 activated natural killer cells and complemented other stimulatory pathways, including Fc\u03b3RIII and NKG2D, resulting in IFN\u03b3 production and expression of CD107a. NLRP3 activation in vivo was confirmed by a dose-related increase in plasma IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 levels in cynomolgus monkeys administered VTX-2337. These results are highly relevant to clinical studies of combination VTX-2337/cetuximab treatment. Cetuximab, a clinically approved, epidermal growth factor receptor-specific monoclonal antibody, activates NK cells through interactions with Fc\u03b3RIII and facilitates ADCC of tumor cells. Our preliminary findings from a Phase I open-label, dose-escalation, trial that enrolled 13 patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN show that patient NK cells become more responsive to stimulation by NKG2D or Fc\u03b3RIII following VTX-2337 treatment. Together, these results indicate that TLR8 stimulation and inflammasome activation by VTX-2337 can complement Fc\u03b3RIII engagement and may augment clinical responses in SCCHN patients treated with cetuximab.

Palliative systemic therapy for patients with R/M HNSCC typically includes a platinum-based doublet, with an understanding that the increase in efficacy compared with single agents is primarily related to improved response rate, and not survival. Till date, the only systemic therapy regimen to demonstrate survival superiority over platinum-5-fluorouracil (5-FU) doublet is platinum, FU, and cetuximab. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have achieved only a modest success in R/M HNSCC. Immunotherapy represents an attractive treatment option for R/M HNSCC, with encouraging preliminary data from studies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and toll-like receptor agonists (e.g., motolimod).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29352859": "Migraine is a neurovascular disorder that involves activation of the trigeminovascular system and cranial vasodilation mediated by release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The gold standard for acute migraine treatment are the triptans, 5-HT<sub>1B/1D/(1F)</sub> receptor agonists. Their actions are thought to be mediated through activation of: (i) 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors in cranial blood vessels with subsequent cranial vasoconstriction; (ii) prejunctional 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on trigeminal fibers that inhibit trigeminal CGRP release; and (iii) 5-HT<sub>1B/1D/1F</sub> receptors in central nervous system involved in (anti)nociceptive modulation. Unfortunately, coronary arteries also express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors whose activation would produce coronary vasoconstriction; hence, triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, since migraineurs have an increased cardiovascular risk, it is important to develop antimigraine drugs devoid of vascular (side) effects. Ditans, here defined as selective 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists, were developed on the basis that most of the triptans activate trigeminal 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptors, which may explain part of the triptans' antimigraine action. Amongst the ditans, lasmiditan: (i) fails to constrict human coronary arteries; and (ii) is effective for the acute treatment of migraine in preliminary Phase III clinical trials. Admittedly, the exact site of action is still unknown, but lasmiditan possess a high lipophilicity, which suggests a direct action on the central descending antinociceptive pathways. Furthermore, since 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptors are located on trigeminal fibers, they could modulate CGRP release. This review will be particularly focussed on the similarities and differences between the triptans and the ditans, their proposed sites of action, side effects and their cardiovascular risk profile.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29488143": "Migraine is a common neurological disease characterised by the presence of attacks of unilateral, severe head pain accompanied by other symptoms. Although it has been classified as the sixth most disabling disorder, the available therapeutic options to treat this condition have not progressed accordingly. The advance in the development of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists for migraine, including 5-HT<sub>1B/D</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists, has meant a major step forward towards the progression of a better treatment for migraine. Triptans have a limited efficacy, and their effect on vasoconstriction makes them unsafe for patients with cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, novel effective antimigraine treatments without cardiovascular effects are required, such as selective 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists (ditans). Lasmiditan has much higher affinity for the 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor than for the vasoconstrictor 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor. This has been confirmed in preclinical studies performed to date, where lasmiditan showed no effect on vasoconstriction, and in clinical trials, where healthy individuals and patients did not report cardiac events due to treatment with lasmiditan, although it should be confirmed in larger cohorts. Lasmiditan crosses the blood-brain barrier and may act both centrally and peripherally on 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptors expressed on trigeminal neurons. It is a well-tolerated compound that does not induce major adverse events. Although ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety, lasmiditan might offer an alternative to treat acute migraine with no associated cardiovascular risk. This review will focus on the characterisation of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists and their effects as migraine therapies.",

The cornerstone of pharmacological treatment is represented by the acute therapy. The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor subtype 1<sub>B</sub>/1<sub>D</sub> agonists, called triptans, are nowadays the first-line acute therapy for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients are not satisfied with this acute treatment, either for lack of response or side effects. Moreover, their mechanism of action based on vasoconstriction makes them unsuitable for patients with previous cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and for those with uncontrolled hypertension. Since the introduction of triptans, no other acute drug class has passed all developmental stages. The research for a new drug lacking vasoconstrictive effects led to the development of lasmiditan, a highly selective 5-HT1<sub>F</sub> receptor agonist with minimized interactions with other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Lasmiditan is considered to be the first member of a new drug category, the neurally acting anti-migraine agent (NAAMA). Phase II and III trials had shown superiority compared to placebo and absence of typical triptan-associated adverse events (AEs). Most of the AEs were related to the central nervous system, depending on the high permeability through the blood-brain barrier and mild to moderate severity. The results of ongoing long-term Phase III trials will determine whether lasmiditan will become available in the market, and then active triptan comparator studies will assess patients' preference. Future studies could then explore the safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding or the risk that overuse of lasmiditan leads to medication overuse headache.",

Areas covered: This paper reviews antimigraine drugs targeting 5-HT receptors in one phase I trial (sumatriptan iontophoretic transdermal system, TDS) and five phase II clinical trials (PNU-142633, LY334370, lasmiditan, NOX-188). Expert opinion: Data from our overview on investigational drugs in phase I and II clinical trials using the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonist (sumatriptan TDS), 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor agonist (PNU-142633), 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists (LY334370, lasmiditan) and a combined 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonist with nNOS inhibition (NOX-188) provided encouraging data for sumatriptan TDS and lasmiditan, disappointing results for PNU-142633, and promising findings for NOX-188. The 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonist lasmiditan, a drug acting through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms, represents a promising safe, effective and tolerated acute migraine therapy also for patients at cardiovascular risk. Upcoming phase III trials should clarify the optimal lasmiditan dose and eventual clinical advantages over triptans. The negative results for the PNU-142633 trial prompt further studies using specific compounds more precisely targeting 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors. Antagonism at 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and 5-TH<sub>7</sub> receptors, a promising strategy to prevent migraine, is still limited to experimental migraine models.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29098075": "Migraine remains one of the most disabling disorders worldwide. The high prevalence in the general population and the often-delicate treatment of patients account for that. Therapeutic management of migraine relies mainly on non-specific medical treatment and is affected by low patient adherence to the treatment regimens applied. The introduction of specific anti-migraine treatment occurred over 20 years ago when the first triptan was approved by regulatory authorities (sumatriptan, 28 December 1992). Triptan use is limited by side effects, time- and frequency-restricted application, and the risk of developing medication overuse headache. Within the past few years, new and promising drugs such as more specific 5-HT 1F receptor agonists (that is, lasmiditan) and monoclonal calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antibodies entered advanced development phases while non-invasive neuromodulatory approaches were suggested to be potentially effective as non-pharmaceutical interventions for migraine.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105160": "Antiretroviral (ART) therapy for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has undergone significant changes over the past 30 years. Many single-tablet regimens (STRs), including newer fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets, are available, offering patients several options for choosing a treatment regimen that works best for them. Given these changes, patients are more likely to adhere to treatment, achieve better clinical outcomes, and experience both fewer side effects and drug-drug interactions. Newer STRs include dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC)/abacavir (ABC) (Triumeq; Viiv Healthcare, Research Triangle Park, NC), rilpivirine (RPV)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) (Odefsey; Gilead, Foster City, CA), RPV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (Complera; Gilead), elvitegravir (EVG)/cobicistat (COBI)/FTC/TDF (Stribild; Gilead), and EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF (Genvoya; Gilead). Recently approved FDCs, such as atazanavir (ATV)/COBI (Evotaz; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), darunavir (DRV)/COBI (Prezcobix; Janssen Products, Titusville NJ), and FTC/TAF (Descovy; Gilead), are also now available. The Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines for HIV recommend many of these integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) STRs as a preferred choice for initiation of treatment in both ART-naive and -experienced patients because they offer comparably faster rates of virologic suppression, reduced rates of resistance development (especially with DTG), and overall better adherence than protease inhibitors or NNRTIs. Numerous phase 3 clinical trials support these recommendations including several switch or simplification clinical trials. Notably, the novel pharmacokinetic booster COBI, with its water soluble properties, has enabled the development and coformulation of a few of these STRs and FDCs. Also, a newer tenofovir salt formulation, TAF, has an advantageous pharmacokinetic profile, contributing to better overall renal and bone tolerability compared with TDF. Further simplification regimens comprising dual ART therapies are currently being explored. This review provides an overview of the clinical efficacy and safety data for these coformulated agents, highlighting the relative impact on comparative adverse events, assessing the potential for experiencing fewer drug-drug interactions, and discussing the clinical implications regarding adherence to treatment.",

Crushing can alter drug exposure, possibly leading to treatment failure, development of resistance or toxicity. Currently, there is no information about crushing of the branded fixed-dose combination of dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (Triumeq\u00ae, referred to as TRI); therefore, crushing of TRI is not recommended. To investigate whether the TRI fixed-dose combination tablet can be crushed and combined with enteral nutrition without influencing pharmacokinetics (PK). We carried out an open-label, three-period, randomized, single-dose, crossover trial in 22 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects randomly received whole-tablet TRI with fasting (reference), crushed and suspended TRI with fasting or crushed and suspended TRI with oral intake of enteral nutrition. Bioequivalence criteria (80%-125% acceptance range) of AUC0-\u221e and Cmax were used. ClinicalTrials.gov: <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02569346\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02569346</a>. Crushing TRI leads to higher dolutegravir exposure (AUC0-\u221e: +26% and Cmax: +30%) and, if crushed TRI is combined with enteral nutrition, to a decrease in abacavir Cmax (-17%). Lamivudine concentrations were not affected as geometric mean ratios with 90% CIs fell within the 80%-125% range. Bioequivalence could not be demonstrated for a crushed and suspended tablet or a crushed and suspended tablet with oral intake of enteral nutrition compared with whole-tablet TRI with fasting. Both scenarios led to higher dolutegravir exposure, but this did not exceed exposure after intake with food or in twice-daily dosing. In our opinion, TRI can be crushed for patients with swallowing difficulties and can be simultaneously administered with enteral nutrition.",

One of them is hepatic capillariasis, caused by the parasite Capillaria hepatica, primarily a disease of rodents, with hepatic manifestations in humans. Although its prevalence is very low, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality, with cases reported from all over the world. The main infective form for humans is the embryonated egg of the parasite, which hatches in the intestine and ultimately colonize the liver. The larvae mature and reproduce, and eventually form embryonated eggs, which cause chronic focal inflammation and septal hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation mainly consists of fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and eosinophilia. Spurious infection with unembryonated eggs cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnostic modalities include liver biopsy, ultrasonography, CT scan, immunological tests like ELISA and IIFT. The infection can be treated mainly with a combination of benzimidazoles like thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole; with corticosteroids. The study emphasizes the need for hepatic capillariasis to be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of suspected hepatitis, leptospirosis, abdominal lymphadenopathy or other hepatic or parasitic infections prevalent in the region concerned; and meticulously assess the cases to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, thus reducing the distress faced by patients.",

In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with CLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a 2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function and 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was compared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We also compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two groups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more than 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks). Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy population. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor-language score was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30058112": " Baricitinib is an orally administered inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that has been shown to be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was undertaken to analyze changes in lymphocyte cell subsets during baricitinib treatment and to correlate these changes with clinical outcomes. An integrated analysis was conducted by pooling data from 3 completed phase III trials comparing placebo with baricitinib treatment (RA-BEAM, RA-BUILD, and RA-BEACON) and 1 ongoing long-term extension study (RA-BEYOND) in patients with active RA (n = 2,186). Baricitinib treatment was associated with an early transient increase in total lymphocyte count at week 4, which returned to baseline by week 12. Transient changes within normal reference ranges in T cells and subsets were observed with baricitinib treatment, up to week 104. B cells and relevant subpopulations increased after 4 weeks of baricitinib treatment, with no further increases noted through 104 weeks of treatment. Natural killer (NK) cells temporarily increased after 4 weeks of baricitinib treatment, before decreasing below baseline levels and then stabilizing over time. With baricitinib treatment, few correlations were observed between changes in lymphocyte subsets and clinical end points, and most correlations were also observed within the placebo group. A modest potential association between low NK cell numbers and treatment-emergent infections was observed in the baricitinib 4 mg/day treatment group, but not for serious infections or herpes zoster. Overall, these findings demonstrate that changes in lymphocyte subsets were largely within normal reference ranges across the baricitinib phase III RA clinical program and were not associated with increased risk of serious infections.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818516": " The JAK kinases are a family of four tyrosine receptor kinases that play a pivotal role in cytokine receptor signalling pathways via their interaction with signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins. Selective inhibitors of JAK kinases are viewed as of considerable potential as disease-modifying anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This article provides a review of the clinical development and available clinical results for those JAK inhibitors currently under investigation. Phase II data for four JAK inhibitors (baricitinib, decernotinib, filgotinib and INCB-039110) are contrasted with that reported for the recently approved JAK inhibitor tofacitinib. The preclinical data on these, in addition to peficitinib, ABT-494, INCB-047986 and AC-410 are also discussed, as are some of the inhibitors in preclinical development. JAK inhibitors are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as evidenced by several inhibitors enabling the majority of treated patients to achieve ACR20 responses, with baricitinib and INCB-039110 both effective when administered once daily. JAK inhibitors differ in isoform specificity profiles, with good efficacy achievable by selective inhibition of either JAK1 (filgotinib or INCB-039110) or JAK3 (decernotinib). It remains to be seen what selectivity provides the optimal side-effect profile and to what extent inhibition of JAK2 should be avoided.",

We evaluated baricitinib's safety profile through 288 weeks (up to September 1, 2016) with an integrated database [8 phase III/II/Ib trials, 1 longterm extension (LTE)]. The \"all-bari-RA\" group included patients who received any baricitinib dose. Placebo comparison was based on the 6 studies with 4 mg and placebo up to Week 24 (\"placebo-4 mg\" dataset). Dose response assessment was based on 4 studies with 2 mg and 4 mg including LTE data (\"2 mg-4 mg-extended\"). The uncommon events description used the non-controlled all-bari-RA. There were 3492 patients who received baricitinib for 6637 total patient-years (PY) of exposure (median 2.1 yrs, maximum 5.5 yrs). No differences in rates of death, adverse events leading to drug discontinuation, malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), or serious infections were seen for 4 mg versus placebo or for 4 mg versus 2 mg. Infections including herpes zoster were significantly more frequent for 4 mg versus placebo. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism were reported with 4 mg but not placebo [all-bari-RA incidence rate (IR) 0.5/100 PY]; the IR did not differ between doses (0.5 vs 0.6/100 PY, 2 mg vs 4 mg, respectively) or compared to published RA rates. All-bari-RA had 6 cases of lymphoma (IR 0.09/100 PY), 3 gastrointestinal perforations (0.05/100 PY), 10 cases of tuberculosis (all in endemic areas; 0.15/100 PY), and 22 all-cause deaths (0.33/100 PY). IR for malignancies (0.8/100 PY) and MACE (0.5/100 PY) were low and did not increase with prolonged exposure. In this integrated analysis of patients with moderate to severe active RA with exposure up to 5.5 years, baricitinib has an acceptable safety profile in the context of demonstrated efficacy.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500799": "Two different Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors-baricitinib and tofacitinib-are effective and licensed in active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There have been recent concerns about potential thromboembolic risks with these drugs. Concerns about baricitinib focus on clinical trial findings. Using all publically available data, we estimate thromboembolic risks are approximately five events per 1000 patient years with 4 mg baricitinib daily. Concerns about tofacitinib have been raised by analyses of the Federal Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERs). These show some evidence of increased risks of pulmonary thrombosis, though not pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis. Observational studies suggest in the general population and non-RA controls there are one to four thromboembolic events per 1000 patient years. In RA, thromboembolic risks increase to three to seven per 1000 patient years. The impact of biologics and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on disease risk appears minimal, and the number of thromboembolic events is between four and eight per 1000 patient years. In the short term, full details of thromboembolic events in trials of JAK inhibitors need to be published. As the numbers of thromboembolic events will be small and patients enrolled in trials are not representative of all RA patients who may receive JAK inhibitors, this information is unlikely to provide definitive answers. Consequently, in the longer term, large observational studies are needed to accurately quantify thromboembolic risks attributable to JAK inhibitors and other drugs used to treat RA, and differentiate these from risks attributable to RA itself and its comorbidities.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27427830": " Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by systemic synovitis causing joint destruction. With the development of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and combination of conventional DMARDs, clinical remission is perceived as an appropriate and realistic goal in many patients. However, bDMARDs require intravenous or subcutaneous injection and some patients fail to respond to bDMARDs or lose their primary response. Under the circumstances, targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), which are orally available low-molecular weight products, have been emerging. Five phase 3 trials of Baricitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, have been performed and showed high clinical efficacy in patients with active RA and na\u00efve to sDMARDs or an inadequate response to sDMARDs, MTX or bDMARDs. There was a favorable response for clinical and functional parameters in studies with placebo, MTX and adalimumab as comparator. It is also reported that safety was tolerable within the limited study period. We here review the recent progress in the development of baricitinib and its potential for the treatment of RA. Expert commentary: Although baricitinib is only one of the highly effective DMARDs that has a new mode of action, it will bring new concepts for rheumatology in the future.",

Tofacitinib 5 mg, twice daily, is approved for treatment, with or without methotrexate, of moderate to severe active RA in adults not adequately responding to, or not tolerating one or more DMARDs. In this narrative review we aimed to provide an overview of the real-world evidence for tofacitinib in RA. The literature was reviewed up to March 2018 for studies regarding the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib for the treatment of RA. The focus was mainly on real-world studies with implications for every day clinical practice. The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib have been comprehensively assessed in a wide programme of randomised controlled trials. Extensive observational research on tofacitinib in RA is also ongoing worldwide and a substantial body of post-marketing real-world data from clinical practice is becoming available. There was a degree of consistency across the real-world studies reviewed. Tofacitinib tends to be used as monotherapy more frequently than bDMARDS and appears to be effective without background methotrexate. The data show a manageable safety profile, with no new safety signals and a discontinuation rate from safety issues &lt;10%. Patients initiating tofacitinib usually have longer disease duration and have been exposed to longer bDMARDs than patients initiating a bDMARD. Real-world data are a key component of the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this novel drug and are of interest to all stakeholders. Treatment persistence and adherence to tofacitinib are good overall and similar to those seen for bDMARDs.",

JAKs transduce intracellular signals from cell surface receptors for various cytokines and growth factors involved in inflammation and immune function, suggesting JAK inhibitors may be of therapeutic benefit in inflammatory conditions. In February 2017, baricitinib was approved in the EU, as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate, for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Regulatory approval to market baricitinib as a treatment for RA has also been sought in the USA and Japan.

We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine direct and indirect evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib and baricitinib in combination with DMARDs in RA patients with an inadequate DMARD or biologic response. Twelve RCTs including 5883 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 15 pairwise comparisons including 10 direct comparisons of 6 interventions. Tofacitinib 10 mg + methotrexate (MTX) and baricitinib 4 mg + MTX were among the most effective treatments for active RA with an inadequate DMARD or biologic response, followed by baricitinib 2 mg + MTX, tofacitinib 5 mg + MTX, and adalimumab + MTX. The ranking probability based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that tofacitinib 10 mg + MTX had the highest probability of being the best treatment to achieve the ACR20 response rate (SUCRA = 0.865), followed by baricitinib 4 mg + MTX (SUCRA = 0.774), baricitinib 2 mg + MTX (SUCRA = 0.552), tofacitinib 5 mg + MTX (SUCRA = 0.512), adalimumab + MTX (SUCRA = 0.297), and placebo + MTX (SUCRA &lt;0.001). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of serious adverse events after treatment with tofacitinib + MTX, baricitinib + MTX, adalimumab + MTX, or placebo + MTX. In RA patients with an inadequate response to DMARDs or biologics, tofacitinib 10 mg + MTX and baricitinib 4 mg + MTX were the most efficacious interventions and were not associated with a significant risk of serious adverse events.",

End-point measures evaluated after adjustment for multiplicity included 20% improvement according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20 response) (the primary end point), the Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28), the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, and the Simplified Disease Activity Index at week 12, as well as radiographic progression of joint damage as measured by the van der Heijde modification of the total Sharp score (mTSS) (range, 0 to 448, with higher scores indicating greater structural joint damage) at week 24. More patients had an ACR20 response at week 12 with baricitinib than with placebo (primary end point, 70% vs. 40%, P&lt;0.001). All major secondary objectives were met, including inhibition of radiographic progression of joint damage, according to the mTSS at week 24 with baricitinib versus placebo (mean change from baseline, 0.41 vs. 0.90; P&lt;0.001) and an increased ACR20 response rate at week 12 with baricitinib versus adalimumab (70% vs. 61%, P=0.014).
