However, the approval of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has shifted the treatment paradigm and provides hope for improved survival. The ability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to evade the host immune system can be overcome by agents such as pembrolizumab (MK-3475/lambrolizumab), which is a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. In early studies, treatment with pembrolizumab led to dramatic and durable responses in select patients (PD-L1+ tumors). This remarkable efficacy lead to approval of pembrolizumab in the second-line setting as response rates were almost doubled compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Most recently, data in the first-line setting from the KEYNOTE-024 study have redefined the SOC therapy for a selected subset of patients. In patients with \u226550% PD-L1+ tumors, pembrolizumab had a clear progression-free survival and overall survival benefit. Toxicity was mostly immune related and similar to checkpoint blockade toxicities observed in previous studies. The initial approval and subsequent studies of pembrolizumab required and utilized a companion diagnostic test, Dako's IHC 22C3, to assess PD-L1 status of patients. The evaluation and scoring system of this assay has been used by other companies as a reference to develop their own assays, which may complicate selection of patients. Finally, the impact of pembrolizumab in NSCLC is growing as evidenced by the numerous, ongoing trials open for combinations with chemotherapy, chemoradiation, other immunotherapeutics, immunomodulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Further studies are also evaluating pembrolizumab in small-cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. This explosion of studies truly conveys the lack of therapeutic answers for lung cancer patients and the promise of pembrolizumab.",

Here we report that increased calcineurin/Nfat signalling and decreased miR-25 expression integrate to re-express the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor dHAND (also known as Hand2) in the diseased human and mouse myocardium. In line, mutant mice overexpressing Hand2 in otherwise healthy heart muscle cells developed a phenotype of pathological hypertrophy. Conversely, conditional gene-targeted Hand2 mice demonstrated a marked resistance to pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy, fibrosis, ventricular dysfunction and induction of a fetal gene program. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of miR-25 by a specific antagomir evoked spontaneous cardiac dysfunction and sensitized the murine myocardium to heart failure in a Hand2-dependent manner. Our results reveal that signalling cascades integrate with microRNAs to induce the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 in the postnatal mammalian myocardium with impact on embryonic gene programs in heart failure.",

MIC-1/GDF15 is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and increased levels of MIC-1/GDF15 are associated with a variety of diseases including cognitive decline. Furthermore, Mic-1/Gdf15 knockout mice (Mic-1 KO) weigh more, have increased adiposity, associated with increased spontaneous food intake, and exhibit reduced basal energy expenditure and physical activity. The current study was designed to comprehensively determine the role of MIC-1/GDF15 on behavioural domains of male and female knockout mice including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, cognition, social behaviours, and sensorimotor gating. Mic-1 KO mice exhibited a task-dependent increase in locomotion and exploration and reduced anxiety-related behaviours across tests. Spatial working memory and social behaviours were not affected by Mic-1/Gdf15 deficiency. Interestingly, knockout mice formed an increased association with the conditioned stimulus in fear conditioning testing and also displayed significantly improved prepulse inhibition. Overall sex effects were evident for social behaviours, fear conditioning, and sensorimotor gating. This is the first study defining the role of Mic-1/Gdf15 in a number of behavioural domains. Whether the observed impact is based on direct actions of Mic-1/Gdf15 deficiency on the CNS or whether the behavioural effects are mediated by indirect actions on e.g. other neurotransmitter systems must be clarified in future studies.",

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major driver of GDF-15 production. GDF-15 has favorable preanalytic characteristics and can be measured in serum and plasma by immunoassay. In community-dwelling individuals higher concentrations of GDF-15 are associated with increased risks of developing CV disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer, independent of traditional CV risk factors, renal function, and other biomarkers (C-reactive protein, B-type natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin). Low concentrations of GDF-15 are closely associated with longevity. GDF-15 is as an independent marker of all-cause mortality and CV events in patients with coronary artery disease, and may help select patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome for early revascularization and more intensive medical therapies. GDF-15 is independently associated with mortality and nonfatal events in atrial fibrillation and heart failure (HF) with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. GDF-15 reflects chronic disease burden and acute perturbations in HF and responds to improvements in hemodynamic status. GDF-15 is independently associated with major bleeding in patients receiving antithrombotic therapies and has been included in a new bleeding risk score, which may become useful for decision support. GDF-15 captures distinct aspects of CV disease development, progression, and prognosis, which are not represented by clinical risk predictors and other biomarkers. The usefulness of GDF-15 to guide management decisions and discover new treatment targets should be further explored.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28025863": " The cancer-anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS) negatively affects survival and therapy success in cancer patients. Inflammatory mediators and tumour-derived factors are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of CACS. However, the central and peripheral mechanisms contributing to CACS are insufficiently understood. The area postrema (AP) and the nucleus tractus solitarii are two important brainstem centres for the control of eating during acute sickness conditions. Recently, the tumour-derived macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) emerged as a possible mediator of cancer anorexia because lesions of these brainstem areas attenuated the anorectic effect of exogenous MIC-1 in mice. Using a rat hepatoma tumour model, we examined the roles of the AP and of vagal afferents in the mediation of CACS. Specifically, we investigated whether a lesion of the AP (APX) or subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) attenuate anorexia, body weight, muscle, and fat loss. Moreover, we analysed MIC-1 levels in this tumour model and their correlation with tumour size and the severity of the anorectic response. In tumour-bearing sham-operated animals mean daily food intake significantly decreased. The anorectic response was paralleled by a significant loss of body weight and muscle mass. APX rats were protected against anorexia, body weight loss, and muscle atrophy after tumour induction. In contrast, subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation did not attenuate cancer-induced anorexia or body weight loss. Tumour-bearing rats had substantially increased MIC-1 levels, which positively correlated with tumour size and cancer progression and negatively correlated with food intake. These findings demonstrate the importance of the AP in the mediation of cancer-dependent anorexia and body weight loss and support a pathological role of MIC-1 as a tumour-derived factor mediating CACS, possibly via an AP-dependent action.",

Elevations in GDF-15 may identify a novel pathway involved in loss of kidney function among patients with CKD. Among participants in the Clinical Phenotyping and Resource Biobank (C-PROBE) study and the Seattle Kidney Study (SKS), we tested whether kidney tissue expression of <i>GDF15</i> mRNA correlates with circulating levels of GDF-15 and whether elevations in circulating GDF-15 are associated with decline in kidney function. In matching samples of 24 patients with CKD from the C-PROBE study, circulating GDF-15 levels significantly correlated with intrarenal <i>GDF15</i> transcript levels (<i>r</i>=0.54, <i>P</i>=0.01). Among the 224 C-PROBE and 297 SKS participants, 72 (32.1%) and 94 (32.0%) patients, respectively, reached a composite end point of 30% decline in eGFR or progression to ESRD over a median of 1.8 and 2.0 years of follow up, respectively. In multivariable models, after adjusting for potential confounders, every doubling of GDF-15 level associated with a 72% higher (95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 4.45; <i>P</i>=0.003) and 65% higher (95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.50; <i>P</i>=0.02) risk of progression of kidney disease in C-PROBE and SKS participants, respectively. These results show that circulating GDF-15 levels strongly correlated with intrarenal expression of <i>GDF15</i> and significantly associated with increased risk of CKD progression in two independent cohorts. Circulating GDF-15 may be a marker for intrarenal <i>GDF15</i>-related signaling pathways associated with CKD and CKD progression.",

The persistent intrastock polymorphism detected is largely amenable to insertion/excision equilibria at 36 genomic sites that form a gradient in occupancy. In a closely related stock, Bari 1 elements are stable and exhibit a substantially different genomic distribution. These results suggest that in Drosophila preferential insertion sites may be defined with the contribution of host factors, although alternative interpretations are also possible.

Using the conjugative transposon Tn916, a pilot project was initiated to determine the efficiency of gene disruption in the first completely sequenced bacterium, Haemophilus influenzae Rd strain KW20. DNA was isolated from Tn916-mutagenized cells, and the point of transposon insertion was determined by inverse PCR, DNA sequencing, and mapping to the wild-type genome sequence. Analysis of the insertion sites at the nucleotide level demonstrated a biased pattern of insertion into regions rich in stretches of A's and T's. Although Tn916 integrated at multiple dispersed positions throughout the chromosome, 9 of 10 insertion events occurred in noncoding, intergenic DNA. It was determined that the intergenic DNA was over 5% more A + T-rich than that of protein coding sequences. This suggests that A + T-rich sequences similar to the Tn916 insertion site would be more likely to reside in the intergenic DNA. In an effort to identify other likely sites for transposon integration, a hidden Markov model of the consensus target insertion site was derived from the Tn916-H. influenzae junction fragments and searched against the entire genome. Eighty percent of the 30 highest-scoring predicted Tn916 target sites were from intergenic, nonprotein-coding regions of the genome. These data support the hypothesis that Tn916 has a marked preference for insertion into noncoding DNA for H. influenzae, suggesting that this mobile element has evolved to minimize disruption of host cell function on integration.",

We propose that RYS1 could be a foldback (FB) transposon. The FB transposons have been rarely reported in plants; RYS1 is the first described in rye and also the first active plant FB transposon reported. Preferential integration points in the rye genome exist, because the new insertions seem to be located, in all studied cases, in the same genome positions. We assume that RYS1 became active in rye very recently, as different plants from in vivo-growing cultivars showed that these elements were present or absent in the same genomic position in which the in vitro-activated element was found. This high rate of modification in these particular loci, both in the in vivo and in vitro populations, could indicate that probably the mechanisms promoting genetic variability in nature are the same that induce variation in vitro, and the modifications induced by somaclonal variation could be already present in vivo populations.",

These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites. Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons into a particular 100 bp region of a plasmid [G. Liu, A. M. Geurts, K. Yae, A. R. Srinivassan, S. C. Fahrenkrug, D. A. Largaespada,J. Takeda, K. Horie, W. K. Olson and P. B. Hackett (2005) J. Mol. Biol., 346, 161-173 ]. Based on these findings, we extended our examination of integration of SB transposons into whole plasmids and chromosomal DNA. To accommodate sequences up to 3 Mb for these analyses, we developed an automated method, ProTIS, that can generate profiles of predicted integration events. However, a similar approach did not reveal any structural pattern of DNA that could be used to predict favored integration sites for other transposons as well as retroviruses and lentiviruses due to a limitation of available data sets. Nonetheless, ProTIS has the utility for predicting likely SB transposon integration sites in investigator-selected regions of genomes and our general strategy may be useful for other mobile elements once a sufficiently high density of sites in a single region are obtained. ProTIS analysis can be useful for functional genomic, gene transfer and human gene therapy applications using the SB system.",

Although the gene repertoire and gene order of both species are well conserved, the cause of the genome-size difference is not known. To determine the causes for the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions, we compared the pepper genome to that of tomato. For sequence-level analysis, we generated 35.6 Mb of pepper genomic sequences from euchromatin enriched 1,245 pepper BAC clones. The comparative analysis of orthologous gene-rich regions between both species revealed insertion of transposons exclusively in the pepper sequences, maintaining the gene order and content. The most common type of the transposon found was the LTR retrotransposon. Phylogenetic comparison of the LTR retrotransposons revealed that two groups of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements (Tat and Athila) were overly accumulated in the pepper genome. The FISH analysis of the pepper Tat elements showed a random distribution in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, whereas the tomato Tat elements showed heterochromatin-preferential accumulation. Compared to tomato pepper euchromatin doubled its size by differential accumulation of a specific group of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements. Our results could provide an insight on the mechanism of genome evolution in the Solanaceae family.",

An important consideration affecting the choice of transgenic vector is their insertion site preferences.

Here, we compare over 1300 Ds transposon integration sites in zebrafish with Tol2 transposon and retroviral integration sites. Genome-wide analysis shows that Ds integration sites in the presence or absence of marker selection are remarkably similar and distributed throughout the genome. No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed. Remarkably, this feature is also found in transposon and retroviral integrations in maize and mouse cells.

ABCC11 encodes an ATP-driven efflux pump protein that plays an important function in ceruminous apocrine glands of the auditory canal and the secretion of axillary odor precursors. The type of cerumen and underarm odor produced by East Asians differ markedly from that produced by non-Asians. In this initial report we find that both groups emit many of the same VOCs but differ significantly in the amounts produced. The principal odorants are volatile organic C2-to-C6 acids.

To test whether there may be an advantage of one approach over the other for WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis) syndrome - a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by gain-of-function autosomal dominant mutations in chemokine receptor CXCR4 - we performed competitive transplantation experiments using both lethally irradiated WT (Cxcr4+/+) and unconditioned WHIM (Cxcr4+/w) recipient mice. In both models, hematopoietic reconstitution was markedly superior using BM cells from donors hemizygous for Cxcr4 (Cxcr4+/o) compared with BM cells from Cxcr4+/+ donors. Remarkably, only approximately 6% Cxcr4+/o hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) chimerism after transplantation in unconditioned Cxcr4+/w recipient BM supported more than 70% long-term donor myeloid chimerism in blood and corrected myeloid cell deficiency in blood. Donor Cxcr4+/o HSCs differentiated normally and did not undergo exhaustion as late as 465 days after transplantation.

Treatment of WHIM patients currently consists of symptom relief, leading to unsatisfactory clinical responses. As an alternative and potentially more effective approach, we tested the potency and efficacy of CXCR4-specific nanobodies on inhibiting CXCR4-WHIM mutants. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain antibodies. They combine the advantages of small-molecule drugs and antibody-based therapeutics due to their relative small size, high stability, and high affinity. We compared the potential of monovalent and bivalent CXCR4-specific nanobodies to inhibit CXCL12-induced CXCR4-WHIM-mediated signaling with the small-molecule clinical candidate AMD3100. The CXCR4-targeting nanobodies displace CXCL12 binding and bind CXCR4-wild type and CXCR4-WHIM (R334X/S338X) mutants and with (sub-) nanomolar affinities. The nanobodies' epitope was mapped to extracellular loop 2 of CXCR4, overlapping with the binding site of CXCL12. Monovalent, and in particular bivalent, nanobodies were more potent than AMD3100 in reducing CXCL12-mediated G protein activation. In addition, CXCR4-WHIM-dependent calcium flux and wound healing of human papillomavirus-immortalized cell lines in response to CXCL12 was effectively inhibited by the nanobodies. Based on these in vitro results, we conclude that CXCR4 nanobodies hold significant potential as alternative therapeutics for CXCR4-associated diseases such as WHIM syndrome.",

WHIM patient adaptive immunity defects remain largely unexplained. We have previously shown that WHIM-mutant T cells form unstable immunological synapses, affecting T cell activation. Here, we show that, in WHIM patients and WHIM CXCR4 knock-in mice, B cells are more apoptosis prone. Intriguingly, WHIM-mutant B cells were also characterized by spontaneous activation. Searching for a mechanistic explanation for these observations, we uncovered a novel costimulatory effect of CXCL12, the CXCR4 ligand, on WHIM-mutant but not wild-type B cells. The WHIM CXCR4-mediated costimulation led to increased B-cell activation, possibly involving mTOR, albeit without concurrently promoting survival. A reduction in antigenic load during immunization in the mouse was able to circumvent the adaptive immunity defects. These results suggest that WHIM-mutant CXCR4 may lead to spontaneous aberrant B-cell activation, via CXCL12-mediated costimulation, impairing B-cell survival and thus possibly contributing to the WHIM syndrome defects in adaptive immunity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512628": "WHIM syndrome is a condition in which affected persons have chronic peripheral neutropenia, lymphopenia, abnormal susceptibility to human papilloma virus infection, and myelokathexis. Myelokathexis refers to the retention of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow (BM), which accounts for degenerative changes and hypersegmentation. Most patients present heterozygous autosomal dominant mutations of the gene encoding CXCR4. Consequently, aberrant CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling impairs the receptor downregulation causing hyperactivation (gain-of-function) that affects BM homing for myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis and the release of neutrophils in the bloodstream. We report the case of a 26-year-old female with severe foot and hand cutaneous warts since childhood, recalcitrant genital condylomatas, bacterial infections, and intraepithelial cervical neoplasia. Laboratory tests revealed severe B lymphopenia and HPV high and low risk types. HIV testing was negative. Not only CXCR4 but also GATA2, NEMO, and CD40L gene mutations were excluded. BM smears revealed, in the presence of a normal cellularity, hyperplasia of myeloid cells (MPO positive) and karyorrhexis, especially in neutrophils and eosinophils. Of note, neutrophils with altered lobation of nuclei connected by long thin chromatin filaments were observed. Our patient presented a clinical and histological picture reminiscent of WHIM in the presence of normal peripheral neutrophil counts and wild-type CXCR4 gene. Although the BM did not reveal a classical pattern of myelokathexis, the observation of consistent signs of neutrophil dysplasia has fuelled the hypothesis of a novel WHIM variant or a novel immunodeficiency. We speculate that abnormalities that affect CXCR4/CXCL12 pair, including GRK levels or activity, might be responsible for this WHIM-like disorder.",

Some patients present with hypogammaglobulinemia and/or refractory warts of skin and genitalia. Congenital cardiac defects constitute uncommon manifestations of the disease. The disorder, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is caused by heterozygous mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. These mutations lead to an increased sensitivity of neutrophils and lymphocytes to the unique ligand CXCL12 and to an increased accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. Despite greatly improved knowledge of the disease, therapeutic choices are insufficient to prevent some of the disease outcomes, such as development of bronchiectasis, anogenital dysplasia, or invasive cancer. The available therapeutic measures aimed at preventing the risk for infection in WHIM patients are discussed. We critically evaluate the diagnostic criteria of WHIM syndrome, particularly when WHIM syndrome should be suspected in patients with congenital neutropenia and lymphopenia despite the absence of hypogammaglobulinemia and/or warts.

This rare disorder is mostly linked to inherited heterozygous autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding CXCR4, a G protein coupled receptor with a unique ligand, the chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1. Some individuals who have full clinical forms of the syndrome carry a wild type CXCR4 gene. In spite of this genetic heterogeneity, leukocytes from WHIM patients share in common dysfunctions of the CXCR4-mediated signaling pathway upon exposure to CXCL12. Dysfunctions are characterized by impaired desensitization and receptor internalization, which are associated with enhanced responses to the chemokine. Our increasing understanding of the mechanisms that account for the aberrant CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated responses is beginning to provide insight into the pathogenesis of the disorder.

Since there is some evidence that pets also alter the gut microbial composition of infants, changes to the gut microbiome are putative pathways by which pet exposure can reduce these risks to health. To investigate the impact of pre- and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birth scenarios, this study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) cohort, whose mothers were enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2012. Participating mothers were asked to report on household pet ownership at recruitment during the second or third trimester and 3 months postpartum. Infant gut microbiota were profiled with 16S rRNA sequencing from faecal samples collected at the mean age of 3.3 months. Two categories of pet exposure (i) only during pregnancy and (ii) pre- and postnatally were compared to no pet exposure under different birth scenarios. Over half of studied infants were exposed to at least one furry pet in the prenatal and/or postnatal periods, of which 8% were exposed in pregnancy alone and 46.8% had exposure during both time periods. As a common effect in all birth scenarios, pre- and postnatal pet exposure enriched the abundance of Oscillospira and/or Ruminococcus (P &lt; 0.05) with more than a twofold greater likelihood of high abundance. Among vaginally born infants with maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis exposure, Streptococcaceae were substantially and significantly reduced by pet exposure (P &lt; 0.001, FDRp = 0.03), reflecting an 80% decreased likelihood of high abundance (OR 0.20, 95%CI, 0.06-0.70) for pet exposure during pregnancy alone and a 69% reduced likelihood (OR 0.31, 95%CI, 0.16-0.58) for exposure in the pre- and postnatal time periods. All of these associations were independent of maternal asthma/allergy status, siblingship, breastfeeding exclusivity and other home characteristics. The impact of pet ownership varies under different birth scenarios; however, in common, exposure to pets increased the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been negatively associated with childhood atopy and obesity.",

Studies have implicated that epigenetic biomarkers, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non coding RNA mediated regulation serve crucial roles in several disease progression including AD. The aim of our study was to identify the topologically significant AD-related proteins from experimentally validated human protein-protein interaction database, HPRD (interactome) and find out novel epigenetic biomarkers. In this computational work, we constructed AD specific diseasome from AD genelist and interactome. Using this diseasome we screened the interactome with the help of novel parameters namely degree band and similarity index and identified AD related proteins. Regulatory network involving AD related proteins, not previously known to be associated with AD was constructed. Several network motifs and epigenetic modification patterns of regulators of these motifs were studied. Our study identified computationally predicted 22 epigenetic genes and 11 epigenetic miRs, not previously known to be associated with AD, from the network motifs.

Network analysis identified FAF1 (Fas-Associated Factor 1), an apoptosis-potentiating protein, as a possible degradation substrate of NGLY1. Examination of normal tissue microarrays demonstrated that FAF1-to-NGLY1 ratio is maximal (more than 3:1) in skeletal muscle and brain tissues microarrays.

For ohnolog pairs that remain duplicated in two species there is a strong tendency for the faster-evolving copy in one species to be orthologous to the faster copy in the other species, which indicates that the evolutionary rate differences were established before speciation and hence soon after the WGD. We also present evidence that in cases where one ohnolog has been lost from the genome of a post-WGD species, the lost copy was likely to have been the faster-evolving member of the pair prior to its loss.

We develop a simple and computationally efficient protein domain architecture comparison method based on the domain assignments available from public databases. We test the accuracy and the reliability of this method in detecting instances of gene duplication in the yeast S. cerevisiae. In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard functional analysis of the genes. A large number of domains is shared by genes that underwent local and global duplications, indicating the existence of a common set of \"duplicable\" domains. On the other hand, WGD and non-WGD paralogs tend to have different functions. We find evidence that this comes from functional migration within similar domain superfamilies, but also from the existence of small sets of WGD and non-WGD specific domain superfamilies with largely different functions. This observation gives a novel perspective on the finding that WGD paralogs tend to be functionally different from small-scale paralogs. WGD and non-WGD superfamilies carry distinct functions. Finally, the Gene Ontology similarity of paralogs tends to decrease with duplication age, while this tendency is weaker or not observable by the comparison of the domain architectures of paralogs. This suggests that the set of domains composing a protein tends to be maintained, while its function, cellular process or localization diversifies. Overall, the gathered evidence gives a different viewpoint on the biological specificity of the WGD and at the same time points out the validity of domain architecture comparison as a tool for detecting homology.",

By sequencing the K. polysporus genome and comparing it with the S. cerevisiae genome using a likelihood model of gene loss, we show that these species diverged very soon after the WGD, when their common ancestor contained &gt;9,000 genes. The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar. Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently. In addition, by comparing the pattern of gene loss among K. polysporus, S. cerevisiae, and three other yeasts that diverged after the WGD, we show that the patterns of gene loss changed over time. Initially, both members of a duplicate pair were equally likely to be lost, but loss of the same gene copy in independent lineages was increasingly favored at later time points. This trend parallels an increasing restriction of reciprocal gene loss to more slowly evolving gene pairs over time and suggests that, as duplicate genes diverged, one gene copy became favored over the other. The apparent low initial sequence divergence of the gene pairs leads us to propose that the yeast WGD was probably an autopolyploidization.",

Recently, it has become possible to test this notion by searching complete genome sequence for signs of ancient duplication. Here, we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arose from ancient whole-genome duplication, by sequencing and analysing Kluyveromyces waltii, a related yeast species that diverged before the duplication. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication. This resolves the long-standing controversy on the ancestry of the yeast genome, and makes it possible to study the fate of duplicated genes directly. Strikingly, 95% of cases of accelerated evolution involve only one member of a gene pair, providing strong support for a specific model of evolution, and allowing us to distinguish ancestral and derived functions.",

Alterations in the oral microbiota may be associated with disorders such as gingivitis, periodontitis, childhood caries, alveolar osteitis, oral candidiasis and endodontic infections. In the immunosuppressed population, the spectrum of potential oral disease is even broader, encompassing candidiasis, necrotizing gingivitis, parotid gland enlargement, Kaposi's sarcoma, oral warts and other diseases. Here, we used 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to examine the oral microbiome of saliva, mucosal and tooth samples from HIV-positive and negative children. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from a cross-section of patients undergoing routine dental care. Multiple specimens from different sampling sites in the mouth were collected for each patient. The goal of the study was to observe the potential diversity of the oral microbiota among individual patients, sample locations, HIV status and various dental characteristics. We found that there were significant differences in the microbiome among the enrolled patients, and between sampling locations. The analysis was complicated by uneven enrollment in the patient cohorts, with only five HIV-negative patients enrolled in the study and by the rapid improvement in the health of HIV-infected children between the time the study was conceived and completed. The generally good oral health of the HIV-negative patients limited the number of dental plaque samples that could be collected. We did not identify significant differences between well-controlled HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative controls, suggesting that well-controlled HIV-positive patients essentially harbor similar oral flora compared to patients without HIV. Nor were significant differences in the oral microbiota identified between different teeth or with different dental characteristics. Additional studies are needed to better characterize the oral microbiome in children and those with poorly-controlled HIV infections.",

We used a genome-wide short hairpin RNA screen in mouse ES cells to identify genes that are essential for initiation of differentiation. Knockdown of the scaffolding protein Mek binding protein 1 (Mp1, also known as Lamtor3 or Map2k1ip1) stimulated self-renewal of ES cells, blocked differentiation, and promoted proliferation. Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) signaling is required for initial fate commitment of ES cells. Knockdown of Mp1 inhibited FGF4-induced differentiation but did not alter FGF4-driven proliferation. This uncoupling of differentiation and proliferation was also observed when oncogenic Ras isoforms were overexpressed in ES cells. Knockdown of Mp1 redirected FGF4 signaling from differentiation toward pluripotency and up-regulated the pluripotency-related genes Esrrb, Rex1, Tcl1, and Sox2. We also found that human germ cell tumors (GCTs) express low amounts of Mp1 in the invasive embryonic carcinoma and seminoma histologies and higher amounts of Mp1 in the noninvasive carcinoma in situ precursor and differentiated components. Knockdown of Mp1 in invasive GCT cells resulted in resistance to differentiation, thereby showing a functional role for Mp1 both in normal differentiation of ES cells and in germ cell cancer.",

Nuclear hormone receptor Dax1 is one of the crucial factors in the network. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Interaction of Dax1 and Esrrb was mediated through LXXLL motifs of Dax1 and the activation- and ligand-binding domains of Esrrb. Furthermore, Esrrb enhanced the promoter activity of the Dax1 gene via direct binding to Esrrb-binding site 1 (ERRE1, where \"ERRE\" represents \"Esrrb-responsive element\") of the promoter. Expression of Dax1 was suppressed followed by Oct3/4 repression; however, overexpression of Esrrb maintained expression of Dax1 even in the absence of Oct3/4, indicating that Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. We also found that the transcriptional activity of Esrrb was repressed by Dax1. Furthermore, we revealed that Oct3/4, Dax1, and Esrrb have a competitive inhibition capacity for each complex. These data, together with previous findings, suggest that Dax1 functions as a negative regulator of Esrrb and Oct3/4, and these molecules form a regulatory loop for controlling the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of ES cells.",

Comprehension of this DNA motif grammar is opaque, yet recent developments have allowed the interrogation of genome-wide TF binding sites. We reasoned that within this data novel motif grammars could be identified that controlled distinct biological programs. For this purpose, we developed a novel motif-discovery tool termed fexcom that systematically interrogates ChIP-seq data to discover spatially constrained TF-TF composite motifs occurring over short DNA distances. We applied this to the extensive ChIP-seq data available from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition to the well-known and most prevalent sox-oct motif, we also discovered a novel constrained spacer motif for Esrrb and Sox2 with a gap of between 2 and 8 bps that Essrb and Sox2 cobind in a selective fashion. Through the use of knockdown experiments, we argue that the Esrrb-Sox2 complex is an arbiter of gene expression differences between ESCs and epiblast stem cells (EpiSC). A number of genes downregulated upon dual Esrrb/Sox2 knockdown (e.g., Klf4, Klf5, Jam2, Pecam1) are similarly downregulated in the ESC to EpiSC transition and contain the esrrb-sox motif. The prototypical Esrrb-Sox2 target gene, containing an esrrb-sox element conserved throughout eutherian and metatherian mammals, is Nr0b1. Through positive regulation of this transcriptional repressor, we argue the Esrrb-Sox2 complex promotes the ESC state through inhibition of the EpiSC transcriptional program and the same trio may also function to maintain trophoblast stem cells.",

Differentiation of Nanog-KD epiblasts demonstrated requirement for Nanog in stabilization of pluripotency. Nanog expression in epiblast is directly regulated by Nodal/Smad2 pathway in a visceral endoderm-dependent manner. Notably, Nanog promoters switch from Oct4/Esrrb in ICM/ESCs to Oct4/Smad2 in epiblasts. Smad2 directly associates with Oct4 to form Nanog promoting protein complex.

We report the results of the phase 1 study of cemiplimab for expansion cohorts of patients with locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, as well as the results of the pivotal phase 2 study for a cohort of patients with metastatic disease (metastatic-disease cohort). In both studies, the patients received an intravenous dose of cemiplimab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks and were assessed for a response every 8 weeks. In the phase 2 study, the primary end point was the response rate, as assessed by independent central review. In the expansion cohorts of the phase 1 study, a response to cemiplimab was observed in 13 of 26 patients (50%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 30 to 70). In the metastatic-disease cohort of the phase 2 study, a response was observed in 28 of 59 patients (47%; 95% CI, 34 to 61).

The enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 (IDO-2) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO-2) initiate the first step of the KP. IDO-1 and TDO-2 induction in tumors are crucial mechanisms implicated to play pivotal roles in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Here, we report the first comprehensive characterisation of the KP in 1) cultured human glioma cells and 2) plasma from patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Our data revealed that interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) stimulation significantly potentiated the expression of the KP enzymes, IDO-1 IDO-2, kynureninase (KYNU), kynurenine hydroxylase (KMO) and significantly down-regulated 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) and kynurenine aminotransferase-I (KAT-I) expression in cultured human glioma cells.

The diagnosis of AAC was based on clinical manifestations and confirmed by radiologic findings including a distended gallbladder with thickened wall, pericholecystic fluid and absence of gallstones. Results Among the 8411 hospitalized SLE patients in PUMCH, 13 (0.15%) were identified to have SLE-AAC. Eleven (84.6%) of them were female, with a mean age of 30.1 \u00b1 8.6 years. AAC was the initial manifestation of SLE in four (30.8%) cases. Eleven (84.6%) patients complained of fever and abdominal pain, four (30.8%) had positive Murphy's sign and six (46.2%) had elevated liver enzymes. The median SLE Disease Activity Index was 8.0 (range 0-20.0) at the time of AAC.

This is crucial for switching GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) from protein folding to transport states. We performed haploid genetic screens to identify factors regulating GPI-inositol deacylation, identifying seven genes. In particular, calnexin cycle impairment caused inefficient GPI-inositol deacylation. Calnexin was specifically associated with GPI-APs, dependent on <i>N</i>-glycan and GPI moieties, and assisted efficient GPI-inositol deacylation by PGAP1. Under chronic ER stress caused by misfolded GPI-APs, inositol-acylated GPI-APs were exposed on the cell surface. These results indicated that <i>N</i>-glycans participate in quality control and temporal ER retention of GPI-APs, ensuring their correct folding and GPI processing before exiting from the ER.

We found that the O. minuta homologues of PER1, GUP1 and CWH43 are functionally compatible with those of S. cerevisiae. Disruption of GUP1 or CWH43 in O. minuta caused a growth defect under non-permissive conditions. The O. minuta per1\u0394 mutant exhibited a more fragile phenotype than the gup1\u0394 or cwh43\u0394 mutants. To address the role of GPI modification in O. minuta, we assessed the effect of these mutations on the processing and localization of the O. minuta homologues of the Gas1 protein; in S. cerevisiae, Gas1p is an abundant and well-characterized GPI-anchored protein. We found that O. minuta possesses two copies of the GAS1 gene, which we designate GAS1A and GAS1B.

Here we investigated whether 3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase 2 (BDH2), a modulator of intracellular iron homeostasis, was involved in regulating DNA hypomethylation and hyper-hydroxymethylation in lupus CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our results showed that BDH2 expression was decreased, intracellular iron was increased, global DNA hydroxymethylation level was elevated, while methylation level was reduced in lupus CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with healthy controls. The decreased BDH2 contributed to DNA hyper-hydroxymethylation and hypomethylation via increasing intracellular iron in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which led to overexpression of immune related genes. Moreover, we showed that BDH2 was the target gene of miR-21. miR-21 promoted DNA demethylation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through inhibiting BDH2 expression. Our data demonstrated that the dysregulation of iron homeostasis in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by BDH2 deficiency contributes to DNA demethylation and self-reactive T cells in SLE.",

Altered DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation as well as histone modifications mediate changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression in immune cells from SLE patients. Defective epigenetic control contributes to uncontrolled expression of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and co-receptors, resulting in systemic inflammation and tissue damage. While the pathophysiological involvement of epigenetic changes in SLE has been accepted for some time, we only recently started to investigate and understand molecular events contributing to epigenetic dysregulation. Here, epigenetic alterations will be discussed with a focus on underling molecular events that may be target of preventative measures or future treatment strategies.",

Though genetic predisposition is essential for disease expression, risk alleles in single genes are usually insufficient to confer disease. Epigenetic dysregulation has been suggested as the missing link between genetic risk and the development of clinically evident disease. Over the past decade, epigenetic events moved into the focus of research targeting the molecular pathophysiology of SLE. Epigenetic alteration can be the net result of preceding infections, medication, diet, and/or other environmental influences. While altered DNA methylation and histone modifications had already been established as pathomechanisms, DNA hydroxymethylation was more recently identified as an activating epigenetic mark. Defective epigenetic control contributes to uncontrolled cytokine and co-receptor expression, resulting in immune activation and tissue damage in SLE. Epigenetic alterations promise potential as disease biomarkers and/or future therapeutic targets in SLE and other autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.",

Although the exact cause of SLE is still unknown, the influence of environment, which is largely reflected by the epigenetic mechanisms, with DNA methylation changes in particular, are generally considered as key players in the pathogenesis of SLE. As an important post-translational modification, DNA methylation mainly suppresses the expression of relevant genes. Accumulating evidence has indicated that abnormal DNA hypomethylation in T cells is an important epigenetic hallmark in SLE. Apart from those classic methylation-sensitive autoimmunity-related genes in lupus, such as CD11a (ITGAL), Perforin (PRF1), CD70 (TNFSF7), CD40 ligand (TNFSF5) and PP2Ac\u03b1, the genome-wide methylation pattern has also been explored recently, providing us a more and more full-scale picture of the abnormal status of DNA methylation in SLE. On the other hand, certain miRNAs, RFX1, defective ERK pathway signaling, Gadd45\u03b1 and DNA hydroxymethylation have been proposed as potential mechanisms leading to DNA hypomethylation in lupus. In this review, we summarize current understanding of T cell DNA methylation changes and the consequently altered gene expressions in lupus, and how they contribute to the development of SLE. Possible mechanisms underlying these aberrancies are also discussed based on the reported literature and our own findings.",

Indeed, there is increasing evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development, cell differentiation and cancer. DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Here, we show an increased 5-hmC level in genomic DNA in CD4(+) T cells of patients with SLE compared with healthy controls, accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the Ten-eleven translocation TET2 and TET3, which can enzymatically convert 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hmC. Moreover, we present the differential patterns of DNA hydroxymethylation in genome-wide promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls. We identified 2748 genes with increased 5-hmC levels in promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells, which were enriched in critical pathways, including neurotrophin signaling, WNT signaling, MAPK signaling, calcium signaling and the mTOR signaling pathway. Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA, which were also confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region of SOCS1. Taken together, our study reveals a critical differential 5-hmC in the genome-wide promoter regions of SLE CD4(+) T cells and provides a novel mechanism that suggests that DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE.",

The mechanism for the substrate selection by eubacterial PAP remains obscure. Structural and biochemical studies of Escherichia coli PAP (EcPAP) revealed that the shape and size of the nucleobase-interacting pocket of EcPAP are maintained by an intra-molecular hydrogen-network, making it suitable for the accommodation of only ATP, using a single amino acid, Arg(197). The pocket structure is sustained by interactions between the catalytic domain and the RNA-binding domain. EcPAP has a flexible basic C-terminal region that contributes to optimal RNA translocation for processive adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) incorporations onto the 3'-end of RNAs. A comparison of the EcPAP structure with those of other template-independent RNA polymerases suggests that structural changes of domain(s) outside the conserved catalytic core domain altered the substrate specificities of the template-independent RNA polymerases.",

The reaction (A(n) + ATP &lt;--&gt; A(n+1) + PP(i)) is adequately described by a rapid equilibrium random mechanism. Several thermodynamic parameters for the reaction were determined or calculated, including the overall equilibrium constant (K(eq) = 84) and the apparent equilibrium constant of the internal step (K(int) = 4) which involves the rate-determining interconversion of central complexes. A large (100-fold) difference in Vmax accounts for nucleotide specificity (ATP vs CTP), despite an only 3-fold difference in Km. Comparison of the sulfur elemental effect on Vmax for ATP and CTP suggests that the chemical step is rate-determining for both reactions. Comparison of the sulfur elemental effect on Vmax/Km revealed differences in the mechanism by which either nucleotide is incorporated. Consistent with these data, an induced fit mechanism for nucleotide specificity is proposed whereby PAP couples a uniform binding mechanism, which selects for ATP, with a ground-state destabilization mechanism, which serves to accelerate the velocity for the correct substrate.",

We also analyzed its biological function by restoring HIC-1 expression using 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine (5-CdR) and small-activating RNAs for the reversal of HIC-1 tumor suppressive effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. An Agilent Q44h global expressing microarray was probed after restoring the expression of HIC-1. Data demonstrated that HIC-1 expression was reduced significantly in breast cancer tissues. HIC-1 immunohistochemistry resulted in mean staining scores in cancer tissue and normal ductal epithelia of 3.54 and 8.2, respectively (p&lt;0.01). 5-CdR partially reversed HIC-1 expression, and modulated cell growth and apoptosis. dsHIC1-2998, an saRNA, showed activating efficacy in breast cancer cells. A group of differentially expressed genes were characterized by cDNA microarray. Upon saRNA treatment, genes upregulated included those involved in immune activation, cell cycle interference, the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, and cell differentiation.

Most patients with advanced HCC who are not eligible for surgery have limited treatment options due to poor liver function or large, unresectable tumors. Although sorafenib is the standard-of-care treatment for these patients, only a small number respond. For the remaining, the outlook remains bleak. A better approach to target \"undruggable\" molecular pathways that reverse HCC is therefore urgently needed. Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) may provide a novel strategy to activate expression of genes that become dysregulated in chronic disease. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1), a critical regulator of hepatocyte function, is suppressed in many advanced liver diseases. By using an saRNA to activate C/EBP\u03b1, we can exploit the cell's own transcription machinery to enhance gene expression without relying on exogenous vectors that have been the backbone of gene therapy. saRNAs do not integrate into the host genome and can be modified to avoid immune stimulation. In preclinical models of liver disease, treatment with C/EBP\u03b1 saRNA has shown reduction in tumor volume and improvement in serum markers of essential liver function such as albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT). This saRNA that activates C/EBP\u03b1 for advanced HCC is the first saRNA therapy to have entered a human clinical trial.

In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib. These ALK mutations have significant influences on the flexibility of P-loop region and DFG sequences, but do not impair the hydrogen bonds between brigatinib and the residue Met1199 of hinge region. And mutations (L1196M, G1269A, F1174L, and R1275Q) induce diverse conformational changes of brigatinib and the obvious energy variation of residues Glu1167, Arg1209, Asp1270, and Asp1203.

Moving from our experience regarding a patient who developed lung toxicity while receiving 2 different anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-TKIs, we performed a systematic review to assess the epidemiologic magnitude and the clinical significance of such toxicity in NSCLC patients treated with ALK-TKIs. Studies were identified using MEDLINE and additional sources (European Society for Medical Oncology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and World Conference on Lung Cancer abstracts) in agreement with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane guidelines. Lung toxicity was reported in 105 of 4943 NSCLC patients (2.1%). Crizotinib was responsible for pulmonary adverse events (AEs) in 1.8% of exposed patients (49 of 2706). With the limit of a lower number of treated patients (n = 359), brigatinib resulted as the most frequently involved in lung toxicity (7%; n = 25). Pulmonary AEs during therapy with ceritinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib occurred in 1.1%, 2.6%, and 1.8% of the patients, respectively. Sixty-five percent of cases accounted for Grade 3 or 4 events, with a mortality rate of 9%. Radiological patterns of pneumonia were reported in 25 patients, whereas imaging evocative of interstitial lung disease in 37. Overall, 26 of 105 patients (25%) permanently discontinued treatment because of lung toxicity.

The identification of these genetic driver alterations created new potential for highly active therapeutic interventions. After discovery of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC, it was recognized that these confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition. Areas covered: Crizotinib, the first-in-class ALK/ROS1/MET inhibitor, was initially approved as second-line treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC but after this, it was firmly established as the standard first-line therapy for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. After initial response to crizotinib, tumors inevitably relapse. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, more potent and brain-penetrable than crizotinib, may be effective in re-inducing remissions when cancers are still addicted to ALK. Ceritinib and alectinib are approved for metastatic ALK positive NSCLC patients, while brigatinib received granted accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Regarding ROS1 rearrangement, to date crizotinib is the only ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor receiving indication as treatment of ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC. Expert commentary: Although novel ALK-inhibitors are under clinical investigation compared to crizotinib as front-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC, nowadays the current standard first-line therapy for these patients is crizotinib.

Recombinant human TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 peptides were used as substrates. Gingipains including arginine gingipain (RgpB) and lysine gingipain (Kgp) were used as enzymes. Trypsin was used as a control protease. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight / time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used for analyzing peptide mass signals and amino acid sequences of digested TFF peptides.

However, impurity in recombinant TFF3 peptide substrates affected the interpretations of enzymatic reaction by MALDI-TOF/TOF. LC-MS analyses demonstrated that identified fragments of TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 from digestion by gingipains were similar to those by trypsin.

The cell surface proteases Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and Arg-gingipains (RgpA and RgpB) are major virulence factors, and their proteolytic activity is enhanced by small peptides such as glycylglycine (GlyGly). The reaction kinetics suggested that GlyGly may function as an acceptor molecule for gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation. Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human hemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis, whereas the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly. Purified gingipains and whole cells exhibited extensive transpeptidation activities on human hemoglobin. All hemoglobin cleavage sites were found to be suitable for GlyGly transpeptidation, and this transpeptidation enhanced hemoglobin digestion. The transpeptidation products were often more abundant than the corresponding hydrolysis products. In the absence of GlyGly, hemoglobin peptides produced during digestion were utilized as acceptors leading to the detection of up to 116 different transpeptidation products in a single reaction. P. gingivalis cells were able to digest hemoglobin faster when acceptor peptides derived from human serum albumin were included in the reaction, suggesting that gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation may be relevant for substrates encountered in vivo. The transpeptidation of host proteins in vivo may potentially lead to the breakdown of immunological tolerance, culminating in autoimmune reactions.",

Porphyromonas gingivalis expresses several proteinaceous hemin-binding sites, which are important in the binding/transport of heme/hemin from the host. It also synthesizes several virulence factors, namely cysteine-proteases Arg- and Lys-gingipains and two lipopolysaccharides (LPS), O-LPS and A-LPS. The gingipains are required for the production of the black pigment, \u03bc-oxo-bisheme {[Fe(III)PPIX]<sub>2</sub> O}, which is derived from hemoglobin and deposited on the bacterial cell-surface leading to the characteristic black colonies when grown on blood agar. In this study we investigated the role of LPS in the deposition of \u03bc-oxo-bisheme on the cell-surface. A P. gingivalis mutant defective in the biosynthesis of Arg-gingipains, namely rgpA/rgpB, produces brown colonies on blood agar and mutants defective in Lys-gingipain (kgp) and LPS biosynthesis namely porR, waaL, wzy, and pg0129 (\u03b1-1, 3-mannosyltransferase) produce non-pigmented colonies. However, only those mutants lacking A-LPS showed reduced hemin-binding when cells in suspension were incubated with hemin. Using native, de-O-phosphorylated and de-lipidated LPS from P. gingivalis W50 and porR strains, we demonstrated that hemin-binding to O-polysaccharide (PS) and to the lipid A moiety of LPS was reduced compared with hemin-binding to A-PS. We conclude that A-LPS in the outer-membrane of P. gingivalis serves as a scaffold/anchor for the retention of \u03bc-oxo-bisheme on the cell surface and pigmentation is dependent on the presence of A-LPS.",

Although it is essential for fucose salvage, this pathway is thought to make only a minor contribution to the total amount of GDP-fucose. A second pathway, the major de novo pathway, involves conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Here we describe two unrelated individuals who have pathogenic variants in FUK and who presented with severe developmental delays, encephalopathy, intractable seizures, and hypotonia. The first individual was compound heterozygous for c.667T&gt;C (p.Ser223Pro) and c.2047C&gt;T (p.Arg683Cys), and the second individual was homozygous for c.2980A&gt;C (p.Lys994Gln).

There was also a decrease in the incorporation of [5,6-<sup>3</sup>H]-fucose into fucosylated glycoproteins. Lys994 has previously been shown to be an important site for ubiquitin conjugation.

However, the effects of WGD and subsequent gene loss on cellular behavior and metabolism are still poorly understood. Here we develop a genome scale evolutionary model to study the dynamics of gene loss and metabolic adaptation after WGD. Using the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an example, we primarily study the outcome of WGD on yeast as it currently is. However, similar results were obtained using a recontructed hypothetical metabolic network of the pre-WGD ancestor. We show that the retention of genes in duplicate in the model, corresponds nicely with those retained in duplicate after the ancestral WGD in S. cerevisiae. Also, we observe that transporter and glycolytic genes have a higher probability to be retained in duplicate after WGD and subsequent gene loss, both in the model as in S. cerevisiae, which leads to an increase in glycolytic flux after WGD. Furthermore, the model shows that WGD leads to better adaptation than small-scale duplications, in environments for which duplication of a whole pathway instead of single reactions is needed to increase fitness. This is indeed the case for adaptation to high glucose levels. Thus, our model confirms the hypothesis that WGD has been important in the adaptation of yeast to the new, glucose-rich environment that arose after the appearance of angiosperms. Moreover, the model shows that WGD is almost always detrimental on the short term in environments to which the lineage is preadapted, but can have immediate fitness benefits in \"new\" environments. This explains why WGD, while pivotal in the evolution of many lineages and an apparent \"easy\" genetic operator, occurs relatively rarely.",

In this study we compare pairs of identifiable gene duplicates generated by small-scale (predominantly single-gene) duplications with those created by a large-scale gene duplication event (whole-genome duplication) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find a number of quantifiable differences between these data sets. Whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. At first sight, either of these latter two features could provide a plausible mechanism by which the difference in dispensability might arise. However, we uncover no evidence suggesting that this is the case. We find that the difference in dispensability observed between the two duplicate types is limited to gene products found within protein complexes, and probably results from differences in the relative strength of the evolutionary pressures present following each type of duplication event. Genes, and the proteins they specify, originating from small-scale and whole-genome duplication events differ in quantifiable ways. We infer that this is not due to their association with different functional categories; rather, it is a direct result of biases in gene retention.",

Our work combines network analysis and modeling of the large-scale structure of the interactions stemming from the WGD. The results uncover the WGD as a major source for the evolution of a complex interconnected block of transcriptional pathways. The inheritance of interactions among WGD duplicates follows elementary \"duplication subgraphs\", relating ancestral interactions with newly formed ones. Duplication subgraphs are correlated with their neighbours and give rise to higher order circuits with two elementary properties: newly formed transcriptional pathways remain connected (paths are not broken), and are preferentially cross-connected with ancestral ones. The result is a coherent and connected \"WGD-network\", where duplication subgraphs are arranged in an astonishingly ordered configuration.",

However, theoretical predictions suggest such backup by redundancy is evolutionarily unstable, and the extent of genetic robustness contributed from redundancy remains controversial. It is anticipated that, to achieve mutual buffering, the duplicated paralogs must at least share some functional overlap. However, counter-intuitively, several recent studies reported little functional redundancy between these buffering duplicates. The large yeast genetic interactions released recently allowed us to address these issues on a genome-wide scale. We herein characterized the synthetic genetic interactions for \u223c500 pairs of yeast duplicated genes originated from either whole-genome duplication (WGD) or small-scale duplication (SSD) events. We established that functional redundancy between duplicates is a pre-requisite and thus is highly predictive of their backup capacity. This observation was particularly pronounced with the use of a newly introduced metric in scoring functional overlap between paralogs on the basis of gene ontology annotations. Even though mutual buffering was observed to be prevalent among duplicated genes, we showed that the observed backup capacity is largely an evolutionarily transient state. The loss of backup capacity generally follows a neutral mode, with the buffering strength decreasing in proportion to divergence time, and the vast majority of the paralogs have already lost their backup capacity. These observations validated previous theoretic predictions about instability of genetic redundancy. However, departing from the general neutral mode, intriguingly, our analysis revealed the presence of natural selection in stabilizing functional overlap between SSD pairs. These selected pairs, both WGD and SSD, tend to have decelerated functional evolution, have higher propensities of co-clustering into the same protein complexes, and share common interacting partners.

Functional and transcriptional divergence between the copies after gene duplication has been considered the main driver of innovations . However, here we show that increased phenotypic plasticity after duplication plays a more major role than thought before in the origin of adaptations. We perform an exhaustive analysis of the transcriptional alterations of duplicated genes in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae when challenged with five different environmental stresses. Analysis of the transcriptomes of yeast shows that gene duplication increases the transcriptional response to environmental changes, with duplicated genes exhibiting signatures of adaptive transcriptional patterns in response to stress. The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome duplicates being more transcriptionally altered than small-scale duplicates. The predominant transcriptional pattern follows the classic theory of evolution by gene duplication; with one gene copy remaining unaltered under stress, while its sister copy presents large transcriptional plasticity and a prominent role in adaptation. Moreover, we find additional transcriptional profiles that are suggestive of neo- and subfunctionalization of duplicate gene copies. These patterns are strongly correlated with the functional dependencies and sequence divergence profiles of gene copies. We show that, unlike singletons, duplicates respond more specifically to stress, supporting the role of natural selection in the transcriptional plasticity of duplicates.

Using the map of genetic interactions and the re-sequencing of 27 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes evolving for 2,200 generations we show that SSD-duplicates lead to neo-functionalization while WGD-duplicates partition ancestral functions. This conclusion is supported by: (a) SSD-duplicates establish more genetic interactions than singletons and WGD-duplicates; (b) SSD-duplicates copies share more interaction-partners than WGD-duplicates copies; (c) WGD-duplicates interaction partners are more functionally related than SSD-duplicates partners; (d) SSD-duplicates gene copies are more functionally divergent from one another, while keeping more overlapping functions, and diverge in their sub-cellular locations more than WGD-duplicates copies; and (e) SSD-duplicates complement their functions to a greater extent than WGD-duplicates.

Circularization may happen through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) of long terminal repeats (LTRs) flanking Ty elements, by Ty autointegration, or by LTR-LTR recombination. By performing an in-depth investigation of sequence reads stemming from Ty eccDNAs obtained from populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, we find that eccDNAs predominantly correspond to full-length Ty1 elements. Analyses of sequence junctions reveal no signs of NHEJ or autointegration events.

Circularization of genomic DNA is observed across eukaryotic species, in a range of different cell types, and from all parts of the genome. A recent study on circular DNAs in yeast found that transposable element sequence residing in circular structures mostly corresponded to full-length transposable elements. Transposable elements are mobile genetic elements scattered across eukaryotic genomes. Different classes of transposable elements move either through a copy-and-paste or a cut-and-paste. As circular DNA structures may recombine with the genome and re-integrate into a novel genomic locus, transposable elements could move through circularization. In yeast, the predominant type of transposable element is a so-called LTR (long terminal repeats) retrotransposable element that moves through a copy-and-paste mechanism. The observed circularization of this element means it potentially could move through a cut-and-paste mechanism as well. Although further experimental evidence is needed to establish the extent to which movement of transposable elements through DNA circularization takes place, such movement is likely to have a functional impact on the genomic context.",

Patients had histological evidence of metastatic or surgically unresectable locally advanced sarcoma, had received up to three previous lines of systemic anticancer therapy, had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1, and had at least one lesion accessible for biopsy. All patients were treated with 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response. Patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab were included in the safety analysis and patients who progressed or reached at least one scan assessment were included in the activity analysis. Accrual is ongoing in some disease cohorts. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02301039\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02301039</a>. Between March 13, 2015, and Feb 18, 2016, we enrolled 86 patients, 84 of whom received pembrolizumab (42 in each disease cohort) and 80 of whom were evaluable for response (40 in each disease cohort). Median follow-up was 17\u00b78 months (IQR 12\u00b73-19\u00b73). Seven (18%) of 40 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had an objective response, including four (40%) of ten patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, two (20%) of ten patients with liposarcoma, and one (10%) of ten patients with synovial sarcoma. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n=10) had an objective response. Two (5%) of 40 patients with bone sarcoma had an objective response, including one (5%) of 22 patients with osteosarcoma and one (20%) of five patients with chondrosarcoma. None of the 13 patients with Ewing's sarcoma had an objective response. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were anaemia (six [14%]), decreased lymphocyte count (five [12%]), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (four [10%]), and decreased platelet count (three [7%]) in the bone sarcoma group, and anaemia, decreased lymphocyte count, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in the soft-tissue sarcoma group (three [7%] each). Nine (11%) patients (five [12%] in the bone sarcoma group and four [10%] in the soft-tissue sarcoma group) had treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), five of whom had immune-related SAEs, including two with adrenal insufficiency, two with pneumonitis, and one with nephritis. The primary endpoint of overall response was not met for either cohort. However, pembrolizumab showed encouraging activity in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Enrolment to expanded cohorts of those subtypes is ongoing to confirm and characterise the activity of pembrolizumab.

As restoration of complex auditory and balance function is likely to require gene delivery systems that target auditory and vestibular sensory cells with high efficiency, we delivered wild-type Ush1c into the inner ear of Ush1c c.216G&gt;A mice using a synthetic adeno-associated viral vector, Anc80L65, shown to transduce 80-90% of sensory hair cells. We demonstrate recovery of gene and protein expression, restoration of sensory cell function, rescue of complex auditory function and recovery of hearing and balance behavior to near wild-type levels. The data represent unprecedented recovery of inner ear function and suggest that biological therapies to treat deafness may be suitable for translation to humans with genetic inner ear disorders.",

The intrinsic limitations of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), including non-linearity, multidimensionality and floor-effect, have emerged and its usefulness argued. The ALS Milano-Torino staging (ALS-MITOS) system was proposed as a novel tool to measure the progression of ALS and overcome these limitations. This study was performed to validate the ALS-MITOS as a 6-month proxy of survival in 200 ALS patients followed up to 18 months. Analyses were performed on data from the recombinant human erythropoietin RCT that failed to demonstrate differences between groups for both primary and secondary outcomes. The ALS-MITOS system is composed of four key domains included in the ALSFRS-R scale (walking/self-care, swallowing, communicating and breathing), each with a threshold reflecting the loss of function in the specific ALSFRS-R subscores. Sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of the ALS-MITOS system stages and ALSFRS-R decline at 6 months were calculated and compared with the primary outcome (survival, tracheotomy or &gt;23-hour non-invasive ventilation) at 12 and 18 months Predicted probabilities of the ALS-MITO system at 6 months for any event at 12 and 18 months were computed through logistic regression models. Disease progression from baseline to 6 months as defined by the ALS-MITOS system predicted death, tracheotomy or &gt;23-hour non-invasive ventilation at 12 months with 82% sensitivity (95% CI 71% to 93%, n=37/45) and 63% specificity (95% CI 55% to 71%, n=92/146), and at 18 months with 71% sensitivity (95% CI 61% to 82%, n=50/70) and 68% specificity (95% CI 60% to 77%, n=76/111). The analysis of ALS-MITOS and ALSFRS-R progression at 6-month follow-up showed that the best cut-off to predict survival at 12 and 18 months was 1 for the ALS-MITOS (ie, loss of at least one function) and a decline ranging from 6 to 9 points for the ALSFRS-R. The ALS-MITOS system can reliably predict the course of ALS up to 18 months and can be considered a novel and valid outcome measure in RCTs.",

The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in upper extremity motor function measured by the maximum voluntary isometric contraction strength. Secondary end points included safety, survival, change in cerebrospinal fluid prostaglandin E(2) levels, and changes in the rate of decline of leg and grip strength, vital capacity, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, and motor unit number estimates. Celecoxib did not slow the decline in muscle strength, vital capacity, motor unit number estimates, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, or affect survival. Celecoxib was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased frequency of adverse events. Prostaglandin E(2) levels in cerebrospinal fluid were not elevated at baseline and did not decline with treatment. At the dosage studied, celecoxib did not have a beneficial effect on research subjects with ALS, and it was safe. A biological effect of celecoxib was not demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Mice with single or pairwise deletions of ultraconserved enhancers were viable and fertile but in nearly all cases showed neurological or growth abnormalities, including substantial alterations of neuron populations and structural brain defects.

Evaluating the sensitivity to anti-cancer agents, we found U251MG-P1 cells were sensitive to doxorubicin with IC<sub>50</sub> at 200 nM. Although doxorubicin has serious side-effects, establishment of an efficient therapy targeting undifferentiated glioblastoma cell population is necessary.

Mutants of CTX were made using solid-phase peptide synthesis and internalization into human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells was monitored by fluorescence and confocal microscopy. CTX_M1 (ie, [K15R/K23R]CTX) and CTX_M2 (ie, [K15R/K23R/Y29W]CTX) mutants showed at least a twofold improvement in uptake compared to CTX. We further showed that these mutants internalize into HeLa cells largely via an energy-dependent mechanism. Importantly, the mutants have high stability, remaining intact in serum for over 24 h; thus, retaining the characteristic stability of their parent peptide. Overall, we have shown that simple conservative substitutions can enhance the cellular uptake of CTX, suggesting that such type of mutations might be useful for improving uptake of other peptide toxins.",

In a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled study, 162 patients stratified by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels and serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status were randomized 1:3:3:3 to once-weekly oral PBO or vesatolimod (1-, 2-, or 4-mg doses) for 4, 8 or 12 weeks per cohort. Efficacy was assessed by change in baseline HBsAg (log<sub>10</sub> IU/ml) at the primary endpoint (Week 24). Safety assessments included adverse events (AE) and laboratory abnormality monitoring. Pharmacodynamic assessments included peripheral cytokine level quantification and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) mRNA expression evaluation. The majority of patients were male (76%) and HBeAg-negative (79%) at baseline. Most (41-80%) experienced \u22651 AE during the study with the majority of AEs mild or moderate in severity. No significant declines in HBsAg were observed at the primary (Week 24) or secondary endpoints (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 48).

World Health Organ. 81:917-918, 2003). While effective, the smallpox vaccine is currently not recommended for routine use in the general public due to safety concerns (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination). Safe and effective countermeasures, particularly those effective after exposure to smallpox, are needed. Currently, SIGA Technologies is developing the small-molecule oral drug, tecovirimat (previously known as ST-246), as a postexposure therapeutic treatment of orthopoxvirus disease, including smallpox. Tecovirimat has been shown to be efficacious in preventing lethal orthopoxviral disease in numerous animal models (G. Yang, D. C. Pevear, M. H. Davies, M. S. Collett, T. Bailey, et al., J. Virol. 79:13139-13149, 2005; D. C. Quenelle, R. M. Buller, S. Parker, K. A. Keith, D. E. Hruby, et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 51:689-695, 2007; E. Sbrana, R. Jordan, D. E. Hruby, R. I. Mateo, S. Y. Xiao, et al., Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 76:768-773, 2007). Furthermore, in clinical trials thus far, the drug appears to be safe, with a good pharmacokinetic profile. In this study, the efficacy of tecovirimat was evaluated in both a prelesional and postlesional setting in nonhuman primates challenged intravenously with 1 \u00d7 10(8) PFU of Variola virus (VARV; the causative agent of smallpox), a model for smallpox disease in humans. Following challenge, 50% of placebo-treated controls succumbed to infection, while all tecovirimat-treated animals survived regardless of whether treatment was started at 2 or 4 days postinfection. In addition, tecovirimat treatment resulted in dramatic reductions in dermal lesion counts, oropharyngeal virus shedding, and viral DNA circulating in the blood. Although clinical disease was evident in tecovirimat-treated animals, it was generally very mild and appeared to resolve earlier than in placebo-treated controls that survived infection. Tecovirimat appears to be an effective smallpox therapeutic in nonhuman primates, suggesting that it is reasonably likely to provide therapeutic benefit in smallpox-infected humans.",

We aimed to investigate the antidepressant effects of simvastatin as an adjuvant therapy in patients with moderate to severe depression. In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 48 patients were randomly allocated to receive simvastatin or placebo as an adjunct to fluoxetine for six weeks. Patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 6. Probable clinical and laboratory adverse events were also monitored and compared between the two groups. Simvastatin-treated patients experienced significantly more reductions in HDRS scores compared to the placebo group by the end of the trial (p=0.02). Early improvement and response rates were significantly greater in the simvastatin group than the placebo group (p=0.02 and p=0.01, respectively) but remission rate was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.36). No serious adverse event was reported during this trial. In conclusion, simvastatin seems to be a safe and effective adjuvant therapy for patients suffering from major depressive disorder.

Further, studies using animal model of periodontitis and human post-mortem brain tissues from subjects with AD strongly suggest that a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and/or its product gingipain is/are translocated to the brain. However, neuropathology resulting from Pg oral application is not known. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure of wild type C57BL/6 mice to orally administered Pg results in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, microgliosis, astrogliosis and formation of intra- and extracellular amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which are pathognomonic signs of AD. Experimental chronic periodontitis was induced in ten wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 WT mice by repeated oral application (MWF/week) of Pg/gingipain for 22 weeks (experimental group). Another 10 wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 mice received vehicle alone (control group) MWF per week for 22 weeks. Brain tissues were collected and the presence of Pg/gingipain was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, confocal microscopy, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The hippocampi were examined for the signs of neuropathology related to AD: TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, and IL6 expression (neuroinflammation), NeuN and Fluoro Jade C staining (neurodegeneration) and amyloid beta1-42 (A\u03b242) production and phosphorylation of tau protein at Ser396 were assessed by IF and confocal microscopy. Further, gene expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein10 (ADAM10) for \u03b1-secretase and presenilin1 (PSEN1) for \u0263-secretase, and NeuN (rbFox3) were determined by RT-qPCR. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were also determined by IF microscopy. Pg/gingipain was detected in the hippocampi of mice in the experimental group by immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and qPCR confirming the translocation of orally applied Pg to the brain. Pg/gingipain was localized intra-nuclearly and peri-nuclearly in microglia (Iba1+), astrocytes (GFAP+), neurons (NeuN+) and was evident extracellularly. Significantly greater levels of expression of IL6, TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 were evident in experimental as compared to control group (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.00001, p&lt;0.00001 respectively). In addition, microgliosis and astrogliosis were evident in the experimental but not in control group (p &lt;0.01, p&lt;0.0001 respectively). Neurodegeneration was evident in the experimental group based on a fewer number of intact neuronal cells assessed by NeuN positivity and rbFOX3 gene expression, and there was a greater number of degenerating neurons in the hippocampi of experimental mice assessed by Fluoro Jade C positivity. APP and BACE1 gene expression were increased in experimental group compared with control group (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.001 respectively). PSEN1 gene expression was higher in experimental than control group but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). ADAM10 gene expression was significantly decreased in experimental group compared with control group (p&lt;0.01). Extracellular A\u03b242 was detected in the parenchyma in the experimental but not in the control group (p&lt; 0.00001). Finally, phospho-Tau (Ser396) protein was detected and NFTs were evident in experimental but not in the control group (p&lt;0.00001). This study is the first to show neurodegeneration and the formation of extracellular A\u03b242 in young adult WT mice after repeated oral application of Pg. The neuropathological features observed in this study strongly suggest that low grade chronic periodontal pathogen infection can result in the development of neuropathology that is consistent with that of AD.",

Following 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization, carbonyl groups were detected in frontal lobe brain tissue lysates by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis of fixed tissue sections from the frontotemporal lobe and the hippocampus. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of variable carbonyl content and oxidative protein damage in all lysates, with TNF-\u03b1 transgenic blots exhibiting increased protein carbonyl content, with consistently prominent bands at 25 kDa (p = 0.0001), 43 kDa, and 68 kDa, over wild-type mice.

Although most MS patients have a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) at disease onset, a substantial proportion later develop chronic progression, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS. In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients. Reasons now exist for optimism in the search for DMTs for progressive MS. It remains a challenge to identify outcome measures that accurately reflect the underlying pathology in progressive MS, which is less inflammatory and more degenerative than RRMS.",

Ibudilast inhibits several cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, and toll-like receptor 4 and can cross the blood-brain barrier, with potential salutary effects in progressive multiple sclerosis. We enrolled patients with primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in a phase 2 randomized trial of oral ibudilast (\u2264100 mg daily) or placebo for 96 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the rate of brain atrophy, as measured by the brain parenchymal fraction (brain size relative to the volume of the outer surface contour of the brain). Major secondary end points included the change in the pyramidal tracts on diffusion tensor imaging, the magnetization transfer ratio in normal-appearing brain tissue, the thickness of the retinal nerve-fiber layer, and cortical atrophy, all measures of tissue damage in multiple sclerosis. Of 255 patients who underwent randomization, 129 were assigned to ibudilast and 126 to placebo. A total of 53% of the patients in the ibudilast group and 52% of those in the placebo group had primary progressive disease; the others had secondary progressive disease. The rate of change in the brain parenchymal fraction was -0.0010 per year with ibudilast and -0.0019 per year with placebo (difference, 0.0009; 95% confidence interval, 0.00004 to 0.0017; P=0.04), which represents approximately 2.5 ml less brain-tissue loss with ibudilast over a period of 96 weeks.

PDE play a central role in cellular function (e.g. differentiation, synaptic plasticity and inflammatory response) by metabolizing cyclic nucleotides. The results from preclinical and clinical studies indicate that IBD has a broader range of action through suppression of pro\u2011inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20116, IL\u20111\u03b2, TNF\u2011\u03b1), toll\u2011like receptor 4 blockade (TLR\u20114), inhibition of a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), up\u2011regulation the anti\u2011inflammatory cytokine (IL\u201110), and promotion of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, NGF, NT\u20114). Recent data indicate that the efficacy of IBD appears to be independent from PDE inhibition activity and rather linked to glial activity attenuation. Additional advantages of IBD, such as crossing the blood-brain barrier, good tolerance and activity by oral administration, makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for treating neuroinflammatory conditions, where the currently available treatment remains unsatisfying due to poor tolerability and/or sub\u2011optimal efficacy.

For example, the onset of inflammatory bowel disease is associated with enteric proteobacterial infection, yet the mechanistic basis for this association is unclear. We have shown previously that genetic defiency in TLR1 promotes acute enteric infection by the proteobacteria Yersinia enterocolitica. Examining that model further, we uncovered an altered cellular immune response that promotes the recruitment of neutrophils which in turn increases metabolism of the respiratory electron acceptor tetrathionate by Yersinia. These events drive permanent alterations in anti-commensal immunity, microbiota composition, and chronic inflammation, which persist long after Yersinia clearence. Deletion of the bacterial genes involved in tetrathionate respiration or treatment using targeted probiotics could prevent microbiota alterations and inflammation. Thus, acute infection can drive long term immune and microbiota alterations leading to chronic inflammatory disease in genetically predisposed individuals.",

The patient was treated with various regimens of antiepileptic medications for 16 months, but the seizures remained medically intractable. At 3 years of age, he underwent stereotactic laser ablation with an aim of disconnection of the lesion. The procedure was performed with the NeuroBlate SideFire probe. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported use of this technology for this procedure and serves as proof of concept. There were no perioperative complications, and 2 years postprocedure, the patient remains seizure free with marked behavioral and cognitive improvements.",

The authors perform a systematic analysis of two commercially available MRgLITT systems used in neurosurgery: the Visualase\u00ae thermal therapy and NeuroBlate\u00ae Systems. Data extraction was performed in a blinded fashion. Twenty-two articles were included in the quantitative synthesis. A total of 223 patients were identified with the majority having undergone treatment with Visualase (n=154, 69%). Epilepsy was the most common indication for Visualase therapy (n=8 studies, 47%). Brain mass was the most common indication for NeuroBlate therapy (n=3 studies, 60%). There were no significant differences, except in age, wherein the NeuroBlate group was nearly twice as old as the Visualase group (p&lt;0.001). Frame, total complications, and length-of-stay (LOS) were non-significant when adjusted for age and number of patients. Laser neurosurgery has evolved over recent decades. Clinical indications are currently being defined and will continue to emerge as laser technologies become more sophisticated. Head-to-head comparison of these systems was difficult given the variance in indications (and therefore patient population) and disparate literature.",

Ten probe trajectories were plotted on normal magentic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using the Brainlab Stereotactic Planning Software (Brainlab, Munich, Germany). The NeuroBlate\u00ae System (Monteris Medical, MN, USA) was used to conform the thermal burn to the corpus callosum along the trajectory of the probe. The distance of the ideal entry site from either the coronal suture and the torcula or nasion and the midline was calculated. The distance of the probe tip from the dorsal and ventral limits of the callosotomy in the sagittal plane were also calculated. Anterior two-thirds callosotomy was possible in all patients using a posterior parieto-occipital paramedian trajectory through the non-dominant lobe. The average entry point was 3.64 cm from the midline, 10.6 cm behind the coronal suture, and 9.2 cm above the torcula. The probe tip was an average of 1.4 cm from the anterior commissure. For a total callosotomy, an additional contralaterally placed frontal probe was used to target the posterior one-third of the corpus callosum. The average entry site was 3.3 cm from the midline and 9.1 cm above the nasion. The average distance of the probe tip from the base of the splenium was 0.94 cm. The directional thermoablation capability of the NeuroBlate\u00ae system allows for targeted lesioning of the corpus callosum, to achieve a two-thirds or complete corpus callosotomy. A laser distance of &lt; 2 cm is sufficient to reach the entire corpus callosum through one trajectory for an anterior two-thirds callosotomy and two trajectories for a complete callosotomy.",

Unlike standard resections, no craniotomy is required; just a tiny borehole trepanation is sufficient. Damage to cortical areas when accessing deep lesions can be minimized or completely avoided, and treating epileptogenic foci near eloquent or even vital brain areas becomes possible.

We retrospectively reviewed 34 consecutive DTA-HGG patients (24 glioblastoma, 10 anaplastic) who underwent LITT at Cleveland Clinic, Washington University, and Wake Forest University (May 2011-December 2012) using the NeuroBlate(\u00ae) System. The extent of thermal damage was determined using thermal damage threshold (TDT) lines: yellow TDT line (43 \u00b0C for 2 min) and blue TDT line (43\u00b0C for 10 min). Volumetric analysis was performed to determine the extent-of-coverage of tumor volume by TDT lines. Patient outcomes were evaluated statistically. LITT was delivered as upfront in 19 and delivered as salvage in 16 cases. After 7.2 months of follow-up, 71% of cases demonstrated progression and 34% died. The median overall survival (OS) for the cohort was not reached; however, the 1-year estimate of OS was 68 \u00b1 9%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months. Thirteen cases who met the following two criteria-(1) &lt;0.05 cm(3) tumor volume not covered by the yellow TDT line and (2) &lt;1.5 cm(3) additional tumor volume not covered by the blue TDT line-had better PFS than the other 21 cases (9.7 vs. 4.6 months; P = 0.02).

The extent of thermal damage is controlled through use of real-time MR-thermography guidance. Initial results have shown the feasibility of LITT for a variety of brain pathologies. LITT can be considered as an alternative type of surgery for difficult to access brain tumors and also for tumors in patients who are deemed high risk for more traditional surgery.

Adults with suspected supratentorial rGBM of 15- to 40-mm dimension and a Karnofsky Performance Status score of \u2265 60 were eligible. After confirmatory biopsy, treatment was delivered using a rigid, gas-cooled, side-firing laser probe. Treatment was monitored using real-time MRI thermometry, and proprietary software providing predictive thermal damage feedback was used by the surgeon, along with control of probe rotation and depth, to tailor tissue coagulation. An external data safety monitoring board determined if toxicity at lower levels justified dose escalation. Ten patients were treated at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals-Case Medical Center). Their average age was 55 years (range 34-69 years) and the median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status score was 80 (range 70-90). The mean tumor volume was 6.8 \u00b1 5 cm(3) (range 2.6-19 cm(3)), the percentage of tumor treated was 78% \u00b1 12% (range 57%-90%), and the conformality index was 1.21 \u00b1 0.33 (range 1.00-2.04).

Using both techniques, we screened for regulatory regions that become ectopically active during Ras-dependent oncogenesis, and identified 3778 regions that become (over-)activated during tumor development. Next, we applied motif discovery to search for candidate transcription factors that could bind these regions and identified AP-1 and Stat92E as key regulators. We validated the importance of Stat92E in the development of the tumors by introducing a loss of function Stat92E mutant, which was sufficient to rescue the tumor phenotype. Additionally we tested if the predicted Stat92E responsive regulatory regions are genuine, using ectopic induction of JAK/STAT signaling in developing eye discs, and observed that similar chromatin changes indeed occurred. Finally, we determine that these are functionally significant regulatory changes, as nearby target genes are up- or down-regulated. In conclusion, we show that FAIRE-seq and ATAC-seq based open chromatin profiling, combined with motif discovery, is a straightforward approach to identify functional genomic regulatory regions, master regulators, and gene regulatory networks controlling complex in vivo processes.",

Many complex diseases are associated with enhancer malfunction, necessitating the discovery and study of enhancers from clinical samples. Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) technology can interrogate chromatin accessibility from small cell numbers and facilitate studying enhancers in pathologies. However, on average, ~35% of open chromatin regions (OCRs) from ATAC-seq samples map to enhancers. We developed a neural network-based model, Predicting Enhancers from ATAC-Seq data (PEAS), to effectively infer enhancers from clinical ATAC-seq samples by extracting ATAC-seq data features and integrating these with sequence-related features (e.g., GC ratio). PEAS recapitulated ChromHMM-defined enhancers in CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T cells, GM12878, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and pancreatic islets. PEAS models trained on these 5 cell types effectively predicted enhancers in four cell types that are not used in model training (EndoC-\u03b2H1, na\u00efve CD8+ T, MCF7, and K562 cells). Finally, PEAS inferred individual-specific enhancers from 19 islet ATAC-seq samples and revealed variability in enhancer activity across individuals, including those driven by genetic differences. PEAS is an easy-to-use tool developed to study enhancers in pathologies by taking advantage of the increasing number of clinical epigenomes.",

This technique utilizes a hyperactive Tn5 transposase to cause DNA cleavage and simultaneous insertion of sequencing adapters into open chromatin regions of the input nuclei. The application of ATAC-seq to plant tissue has been challenging due to the difficulty of isolating nuclei sufficiently free of interfering organellar DNA. Here we present two different approaches to purify plant nuclei for ATAC-seq: the INTACT method (Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in specific Cell Types) to isolate nuclei from individual cell types of the plant, and tissue lysis followed by sucrose sedimentation to isolate sufficiently pure total nuclei. We provide detailed instructions for transposase treatment of nuclei isolated using either approach, as well as subsequent preparation of ATAC-seq libraries.

Depending on the cell type, ATAC-seq samples may contain ~20-80% of mitochondrial sequencing reads. As the regions of open chromatin of interest are usually located in the nuclear genome, mitochondrial reads are typically discarded from the analysis. We tested two approaches to decrease wasted sequencing in ATAC-seq libraries generated from lymphoblastoid cell lines: targeted cleavage of mitochondrial DNA fragments using CRISPR technology and removal of detergent from the cell lysis buffer. We analyzed the effects of these treatments on the number of usable (unique, non-mitochondrial) reads and the number and quality of peaks called, including peaks identified in enhancers and transcription start sites. Both treatments resulted in considerable reduction of mitochondrial reads (1.7 and 3-fold, respectively). The removal of detergent, however, resulted in increased background and fewer peaks. The highest number of peaks and highest quality data was obtained by preparing samples with the original ATAC-seq protocol (using detergent) and treating them with CRISPR. This strategy reduced the amount of sequencing required to call a high number of peaks, which could lead to cost reduction when performing ATAC-seq on large numbers of samples and in cell types that contain a large amount of mitochondria.",

A fundamental unresolved question is why some STRs are susceptible to pathologic expansion, whereas thousands of repeat tracts across the human genome are relatively stable. Here, we discover that nearly all disease-associated STRs (daSTRs) are located at boundaries demarcating 3D chromatin domains. We identify a subset of boundaries with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological disruption linked to STR expansion. Fragile X syndrome patients exhibit severe boundary disruption in a manner that correlates with local loss of CTCF occupancy and the degree of FMR1 silencing. Our data uncover higher-order chromatin architecture as a new dimension in understanding repeat expansion disorders.",

Examining both human and mouse genomes, we interrogate the relationship of UCEs to three features of chromosome organization derived from Hi-C studies. We find that UCEs are enriched within contact domains and, further, that the subset of UCEs within domains shared across diverse cell types are linked to kidney-related and neuronal processes. In boundaries, UCEs are generally depleted, with those that do overlap boundaries being overrepresented in exonic UCEs. Regarding loop anchors, UCEs are neither overrepresented nor underrepresented, but those present in loop anchors are enriched for splice sites. Finally, as the relationships between UCEs and human Hi-C features are conserved in mouse, our findings suggest that UCEs contribute to interspecies conservation of genome organization and, thus, genome stability.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26181593": "Whole genome duplications (WGD) have now been firmly established in all major eukaryotic kingdoms. In particular, all vertebrates descend from two rounds of WGDs, that occurred in their jawless ancestor some 500 MY ago. Paralogs retained from WGD, also coined 'ohnologs' after Susumu Ohno, have been shown to be typically associated with development, signaling and gene regulation. Ohnologs, which amount to about 20 to 35% of genes in the human genome, have also been shown to be prone to dominant deleterious mutations and frequently implicated in cancer and genetic diseases. Hence, identifying ohnologs is central to better understand the evolution of vertebrates and their susceptibility to genetic diseases. Early computational analyses to identify vertebrate ohnologs relied on content-based synteny comparisons between the human genome and a single invertebrate outgroup genome or within the human genome itself. These approaches are thus limited by lineage specific rearrangements in individual genomes. We report, in this study, the identification of vertebrate ohnologs based on the quantitative assessment and integration of synteny conservation between six amniote vertebrates and six invertebrate outgroups. Such a synteny comparison across multiple genomes is shown to enhance the statistical power of ohnolog identification in vertebrates compared to earlier approaches, by overcoming lineage specific genome rearrangements. Ohnolog gene families can be browsed and downloaded for three statistical confidence levels or recompiled for specific, user-defined, significance criteria at http://ohnologs.curie.fr/.

Dosage sensitive genes frequently occur in the same metabolic pathway and in physically interacting proteins. Accumulating evidence reveals that functionally related genes tend to co-localize in the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of chromosomes. We query whether the spatial distribution of ohnologs has implications for their dosage balance. We analyzed the colocalization frequency of ohnologs based on chromatin interaction datasets of seven human cell lines and found that ohnolog pairs exhibit higher spatial proximity in 3D nuclear organization than other paralog pairs and than randomly chosen ohnologs in the genome. We also found that colocalized ohnologs are more resistant to copy number variations and more likely to be disease-associated genes, which indicates a stronger dosage balance in ohnologs with high spatial proximity. This phenomenon is further supported by the stronger similarity of gene co-expression and of gene ontology terms of colocalized ohnologs. In addition, for a large fraction of ohnologs, the spatial colocalization is conserved in mouse cells, suggestive of functional constraint on their 3D positioning in the nucleus.",

Ohnologs are paralogs stemming from such genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be \"novel\" are more appropriately interpreted as \"ohnologs gone missing\", cases in which ohnologs are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.",

Here we show that non-ohnologs neighbouring ohnologs are unlikely to have copy number variations, resulting in ohnolog-rich regions in vertebrate genomes being copy number variation deserts. Our results suggest that the genomic location of ohnologs is a determining factor in the retention of copy number variations and that the dosage-balanced ohnologs are likely to cause the deleterious effects of copy number variations in these regions.

In this study we analyze the effects of reducing FLI1 in the MRL/lpr lupus prone model on T cell function. We demonstrate that adoptive transfer of MRL/lpr Fli1(+/+) or Fli1(+/-) T cells and B cells into Rag1-deficient mice results in significantly decreased serum immunoglobulin levels in animals receiving Fli1(+/-) lupus T cells compared to animals receiving Fli1(+/+) lupus T cells regardless of the genotype of co-transferred lupus B cells. Ex vivo analyses of MRL/lpr T cells demonstrated that Fli1(+/-) T cells produce significantly less IL-4 during early and late disease and exhibited significantly decreased TCR-specific activation during early disease compared to Fli1(+/+) T cells. Moreover, the Fli1(+/-) T cells expressed significantly less neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) message and decreased NEU activity during early disease and significantly decreased levels of glycosphingolipids during late disease compared to Fli1(+/+) T cells. FLI1 dose-dependently activated the Neu1 promoter in mouse and human T cell lines. Together, our results suggest reducing FLI1 in lupus decreases the pathogenicity of T cells by decreasing TCR-specific activation and IL-4 production in part through the modulation of glycosphingolipid metabolism.

However, relapses occur in up to 40% of patients and refractory disease with fatal outcomes still occurs, typically within the first days of management. In this context, the introduction of rituximab has been the second major breakthrough in TTP management. Rituximab is now routinely recommended during the acute phase, typically in patients with a suboptimal response to treatment, and increasingly as frontline therapy, with high response rates in the following weeks. In more severe patients, salvage strategies typically include twice daily TPE, pulses of cyclophosphamide, as well as splenectomy in the more desperate cases. In this life-threatening and debilitating disease, relapses can be efficiently prevented in patients with a severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency and otherwise in remission with the use of rituximab.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28445600": "Essentials Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is linked with significant morbidity/mortality. Caplacizumab's effect on major thromboembolic (TE) events, exacerbations and death was studied. Fewer caplacizumab-treated patients had a major TE event, an exacerbation, or died versus placebo. Caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the acute morbidity and mortality associated with aTTP. Background Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic microangiopathy. In spite of treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression, patients remain at risk for thrombotic complications, exacerbations, and death. In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody<sup>\u00ae</sup> was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. Objective The clinical benefit of caplacizumab was further investigated in a post hoc analysis of the incidence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations during the study drug treatment period and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-related death during the study. Methods The Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) for 'embolic and thrombotic events' was run to investigate the occurrence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations in the safety population of the TITAN study, which consisted of 72 patients, of whom 35 received caplacizumab and 37 received placebo. Results Four events (one pulmonary embolism and three aTTP exacerbations) were reported in four patients in the caplacizumab group, and 20 such events were reported in 14 patients in the placebo group (two acute myocardial infarctions, one ischemic stroke, one hemorrhagic stroke, one pulmonary embolism, one deep vein thrombosis, one venous thrombosis, and 13 aTTP exacerbations). Two of the placebo-treated patients died from aTTP during the study. Conclusion In total, 11.4% of caplacizumab-treated patients and 43.2% of placebo-treated patients experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, experienced an exacerbation, or died. This analysis shows the potential for caplacizumab to reduce the risk of major thromboembolic morbidities and mortality associated with aTTP.",

In this article, I present a historical perspective on the development of camelid single-domain antibodies (sdAbs or V<sub>H</sub>Hs, also widely known as nanobodies) since their discovery and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these unique molecules in various areas of research, industry, and medicine. Commercialization of camelid sdAbs exploded in 2001 with a flurry of patents issued to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and later taken on by the Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) and, after 2002, the VIB-founded spin-off company, Ablynx. While entrepreneurial spirit has certainly catalyzed the exploration of nanobodies as marketable products, IP restrictions may be partially responsible for the relatively long time span between the discovery of these biomolecules and their entry into the pharmaceutical market. It is now anticipated that the first V<sub>H</sub>H-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter. This elusive first approval, along with the expiry of key patents, may substantially alter the scientific and biomedical landscape surrounding camelid sdAbs and pave the way for their emergence as mainstream biotherapeutics.",

This microvascular thrombosis causes multiorgan ischemia with potentially life-threatening complications. Daily plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapies induce remission, but mortality and morbidity due to microthrombosis remain high. Caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor humanized single-variable-domain immunoglobulin (Nanobody), inhibits the interaction between ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets. In this phase 2, controlled study, we randomly assigned patients with acquired TTP to subcutaneous caplacizumab (10 mg daily) or placebo during plasma exchange and for 30 days afterward. The primary end point was the time to a response, defined as confirmed normalization of the platelet count. Major secondary end points included exacerbations and relapses. Seventy-five patients underwent randomization (36 were assigned to receive caplacizumab, and 39 to receive placebo). The time to a response was significantly reduced with caplacizumab as compared with placebo (39% reduction in median time, P=0.005). Three patients in the caplacizumab group had an exacerbation, as compared with 11 patients in the placebo group. Eight patients in the caplacizumab group had a relapse in the first month after stopping the study drug, of whom 7 had ADAMTS13 activity that remained below 10%, suggesting unresolved autoimmune activity. Bleeding-related adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate in severity, were more common with caplacizumab than with placebo (54% of patients vs. 38%). The frequencies of other adverse events were similar in the two groups. Two patients in the placebo group died, as compared with none in the caplacizumab group. Caplacizumab induced a faster resolution of the acute TTP episode than did placebo. The platelet-protective effect of caplacizumab was maintained during the treatment period.

We considered probesets to be sexually dimorphically expressed (SDE) if they were measurably expressed above background in at least one sex, there was at least a two-fold difference in expression (dimorphism) between the sexes, and the differences were statistically significant after correcting for false discovery. 14.5% of expressed probesets were SDE in at least one tissue, with higher expression nearly twice as prevalent in males compared to females. Most were SDE in a single tissue. Surprisingly, nearly half of the probesets that were (SDE) in multiple tissues were oppositely sex biased in different tissues, and most SDE probesets were also expressed without sex bias in other tissues. Two genes were widely SDE: Xist (female-only) and Eif2s3y (male-only). The frequency of SDE probesets varied widely between tissues, and was highest in the duodenum (6.2%), whilst less than 0.05% in over half of the surveyed tissues. The occurrence of SDE probesets was not strongly correlated between tissues. Within individual tissues, however, relational networks of SDE genes were identified. In the liver, networks relating to differential metabolism between the sexes were seen. The estrogen receptor was implicated in differential gene expression in the duodenum.

This depends on preferential survival of male embryos under conditions of high energy intake. In several species, growth factors including insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 have been shown to promote embryonic development by decreasing apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation. We hypothesized that sex-related differences in IGF-1 expression in equine embryos during the phase of maternal recognition of pregnancy might exist and thus contribute to preferential survival of embryos from either of both sexes under specific environmental conditions. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression of in vivo-produced equine embryos on different days of pregnancy (Day 8, N = 6; Day 10, N = 8; Day 12, N = 14) was analyzed. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The sex of the embryo was determined by detection of X-inactivation specific transcript (Xist) RNA and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome DNA. Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was influenced by sex (P = 0.01) but not by day of pregnancy (relative expression of IGF-1 in relation to \u03b2-actin, Day 8: male 5.1 \u00b1 2.1, female 11.4; Day 10: male 5.2 \u00b1 1.6, female 17.4 \u00b1 6.7; Day 12: male 2.6 \u00b1 0.3, female 11.6 \u00b1 2.4).

In the present study, expression of a Barr-body-specific marker, the X-inactivated-specific transcript (Xist) gene, whose gene product consists of RNA which coats and thereby inactivates one of the X chromosomes, was investigated in equine embryos produced in vivo. Preattachment embryos at different times after ovulation (Day 8: n = 9; Day 10: n = 12; Day 12: n = 15) were analyzed for Xist RNA expression using quantitative and qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Female and male primary equine dermal cell cultures were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Embryos tested negative for Xist were evaluated for expression of the male-specific eSRY gene by qualitative PCR at the DNA level. From 36 embryos assessed by qualitative RT-PCR, 18 showed positive Xist expression (50%). From 29 embryos tested by quantitative RT-PCR, 16 showed positive Xist expression (55%). All of the Xist-negative equine embryos tested by quantitative PCR were positive for eSRY. We also demonstrated by strand-specific RT-PCR that in the horse, as in humans, the counter transcript Tsix seems to be truncated not reaching Exon 1. In contrast to many other species, neither Xist nor Tsix was expressed in equine male testicular tissue. The results demonstrate that expression of Xist is restricted to female equine embryos. Xist can thus be considered an X-inactivation-specific marker which can be used in concert with Y-specific markers for sex determination.",

We evaluated the expression of selected X-linked genes in our 41, XX(Y)* male mice to determine whether these genes escape inactivation and whether tissue-specific differences occur. Correct X inactivation was identified by Xist expression. Relative expression of X-linked genes was examined in liver, kidney and brain tissue by real-time PCR in adult XX(Y)* and XY* males and XX females. Expression of genes known to escape X inactivation was analysed. Relative mRNA levels of Pgk1 (control, X inactivated), and the genes Eif2s3x, Kdm5c, Ddx3x and Kdm6a escaping from X inactivation were quantified from liver, kidney and brain. Pgk1 mRNA expression showed no difference, confirming correct X inactivation. In kidney and liver, XX(Y)* males resembled the female expression pattern in all four candidate genes and were distinguishable from XY* males. Contrastingly, in brain tissue XX(Y)* males expressed all four genes higher than male and female controls. Altered expression of genes escaping X inactivation probably contributes directly to the XX(Y)* phenotype.",

Myosin heavy chain 2B (Myh4) and phosphoglycerate mutase muscle-specific subunit (Pgam) were expressed specifically in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, and uroplakin IIIb (UP3) was expressed specifically in the visceral adipose tissue. DEAD-box Y RNA helicase (DBY) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 gamma Y (eIF2gamma Y) were expressed only in male adipose tissue.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the presence of Xist transcripts in all adult female somatic tissues evaluated. In contrast, among the male tissues examined, Xist expression was detected only in testis. No evidence for Xist transcription was observed after a single round of RT-PCR from pools of in vitro-derived embryos at the 2- to 4-cell stage. Xist transcripts were detected as a faint amplicon at the 8-cell stage initially, and consistently thereafter in all stages examined up to and including the expanded blastocyst stage. Xist transcripts, however, were subsequently detected from the 2-cell stage onward after nested RT-PCR. Preferential [3H]thymidine labeling indicative of late replication of one of the X chromosomes was noted in female embryos of different developmental ages as follows: 2 of 7 (28.5%) early blastocysts, 6 of 13 (46.1%) blastocysts, 8 of 11 (72.1%) expanded blastocysts, and 14 of 17 (77.7%) hatched blastocysts.

Several pathologic processes can produce this syndrome, but neurodegeneration accompanied by neuronal inclusions composed of \u03b1-synuclein (Lewy bodies) is considered the typical pathologic correlate of PD. The neuropathologic features of PD are reviewed based upon personal experience and review of the literature. Molecular pathology of PD is summarized from cell biological and animal studies. The pathologic feature that correlates with signs and symptoms of PD is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra with dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. Neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra preferentially affects the ventrolateral cell group that projects to posterolateral putamen and is accompanied by formation of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. Some patients with PD are found at autopsy to have other pathologic processes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebrovascular disease (vascular Parkinsonism). The peripheral autonomic nervous system is also affected. The triggering event in PD is unknown, but recent studies suggest a role for loss of nuclear membrane integrity. Once \u03b1-synuclein aggregates forms, evidence supports cell-to-cell propagation. PD is a multisystem synucleinopathy caused by poorly characterized genetic and environmental factors that produces degeneration in selectively vulnerable neuronal populations.",

The Lewy body was described in 1912, and the substantia nigra was found to be depigmented with neuronal loss and gliosis in 1919. The link between dopamine and PD began in 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz were the major pioneers. The revolutionary therapeutic breakthrough was the introduction of high dosage levodopa therapy by George Cotzias in 1967. Following 40 years of the dopa/dopamine era, we have entered the era of alpha-synuclein, the protein present in Lewy bodies. Heiko Braak found that alpha-synuclein accumulates initially in the olfactory system and lower brainstem and then travels in an anatomic pattern to involve other regions of the brain and thereby cause progressive symptoms. Alpha-synuclein was somehow converted to a rogue protein. Where this originates and how it is propagated are under intense investigation. At the same time that the alpha-synuclein era was developing, clinical advances took place by recognizing PD as hosting a wide variety of nonmotor features with eventual cognitive impairment in many. Therapeutics has also evolved. Although the most effective therapy for the motor features remains levodopa, surgical approaches and drugs for nonmotor problems continue to expand our ability to treat people with PD. We can expect therapeutic advances in neuroprotection as the basic science discoveries uncovered in the alpha-synuclein era are translated into effective treatments.",

We have shown microtubule regression and mitochondrial and nuclear degradation in neurons with developing Lewy bodies. In PD, multiple Lewy bodies were often observed with \u03b1-synuclein interacting with DNA to cause marked nuclear degradation. In DLB, the mitochondria are drawn into the Lewy body and the mitochondrial integrity is lost. This work suggests that Lewy bodies are cytotoxic. In DLB, we suggest that microtubule regression and mitochondrial loss results in decreased cellular energy and axonal transport that leads to cell death.

These findings are supportive of a mouse model of PD, but information about the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an essential marker of dopaminergic status, was not reported. Clarification of this issue is important because an intracranial rotenone mouse model of Parkinson's disease has not been established. Towards this end, the present study examined the effects of intracranial rotenone treatment on TH and \u03b1-synuclein immunohistochemistry in addition to forelimb motor function. Mice were unilaterally infused with either vehicle or rotenone (2\u03bcg/site) in both the medial forebrain bundle and the substantia nigra.

This is characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory and mitogenic cytokines, reminiscent of an SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype). Conditioned media from senescent MPM (malignant pleural mesothelioma) cells trigger the emergence of EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal)-like, clonogenic and chemoresistant cell subpopulations, expressing high levels of ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) activity (ALDH(bright) cells). We show by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of purified ALDH(bright) and ALDH(low) cells, that both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms converge to maintain the SASP-induced, EMT-like cell subpopulations. Chemoresistant ALDH(bright) cells exist within primary MPM specimens and enrichment for ALDH(bright) cells correlates with an earlier tumor onset into NOD/SCID mice. We show that RAS(v12) expression induces SASP-like changes in untransformed human mesothelial cells, and that p53 ablation increases the effect of RAS(v12) expression. We identify STAT3 activation as a crucial event downstream to SASP signaling. In fact, small hairpin RNA-mediated ablation of STAT3 deeply attenuates the induction of EMT genes and the increase of ALDH(bright) cells induced by SASP-cytokines. This strongly affects the chemoresistance of MPM cells in vitro and leads to anticancer effects in vivo.",

The SASP supports cell-autonomous functions like the senescence-associated growth arrest, and mediates paracrine interactions between senescent cells and their surrounding microenvironment. The biological functions and the regulation of the SASP are beginning to emerge, and current SASP assessment techniques include the analysis of SASP factors at the mRNA level, the direct measurement of factors inside or outside the cell (i.e., secreted), and the detection of SASP-provoked cellular responses. Here, we focus on a simple approach to collect SASP-conditioned media in order to directly measure secreted SASP factors using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As an example, we discuss the assessment of the major SASP factor interleukin-6 in senescent human fibroblasts.

We observed significant correlations between levels of not-diploid cells and senescence-associated features (SAFs). W-CIN induced DNA double strand breaks and elevated oxidative stress, but caused low apoptosis. SAFs of W-CIN cells were remarkably similar to those induced by replicative senescence but occurred in only 13 days versus 4 months. Cultures enriched with not-diploid cells acquired a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) characterized by IL1B, CXCL8, CCL2, TNF, CCL27 and other pro-inflammatory factors including a novel SASP component CLEC11A. These findings suggest that W-CIN triggers premature senescence, presumably to prevent the propagation of cells with an abnormal DNA content.

Interestingly, conditioned medium from senescent HUVECs treated with adalimumab was less consistent than medium from untreated cells in inducing migration- and mammosphere- promoting effects on MCF-7 cells.Our findings suggest that adalimumab can induce epigenetic modifications in cells undergoing senescence, thus contributing to the attenuation of SASP tumor-promoting effects.",

We attempted to determine the expression patterns for a random sample of the annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.",

Its Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) ortholog, AHR-1, facilitates neuronal development, growth and movement. We investigated the effect of AHR mutation on the transcriptional profile of L4 stage C. elegans using RNA-seq and quantitative real time PCR in order to understand better AHR-1 function at the genomic level. Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing yielded 51.1, 61.2 and 54.0 million reads from wild-type controls, ahr-1(ia03) and ahr-1(ju145) mutants, respectively, providing detection of over 18,000 transcripts in each sample. Fourteen transcripts were over-expressed and 125 under-expressed in both ahr-1 mutants when compared to wild-type. Under-expressed genes included soluble guanylate cyclase (gcy) family genes, some of which were previously demonstrated to be regulated by AHR-1. A neuropeptide-like protein gene, nlp-20, and a F-box domain protein gene fbxa-192 and its pseudogenes fbxa-191 and fbxa-193 were also under-expressed. Conserved xenobiotic response elements were identified in the 5' flanking regions of some but not all of the gcy, nlp-20, and fbxa genes. These results extend previous studies demonstrating control of gcy family gene expression by AHR-1, and furthermore suggest a role of AHR-1 in regulation of a neuropeptide gene as well as pseudogenes.",

Fluxes of water and solutes through cell membranes and epithelia are essential for osmoregulation and energy homeostasis. Aquaporins are membrane channels expressed in almost every organism and involved in the bidirectional transfer of water and small solutes across cell membranes. Aquaporins have important biological roles and have been implicated in several pathophysiological conditions suggesting a great translational potential in aquaporin-based diagnostics and therapeutics. Detecting aquaporin function is critical for assessing regulation and screening for new activity modulators that can prompt the development of efficient medicines. Appropriate methods for functional analysis comprising suitable cell models and techniques to accurately evaluate water and solute membrane permeability are essential to validate aquaporin function and assess short-term regulation. The present review describes established assays commonly used to assess aquaporin function in cells and tissues, as well as the experimental biophysical strategies required to reveal functional regulation and identify modulators, the first step for aquaporin drug discovery.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into endothelial lineage cells, which makes them attractive candidates for therapeutic angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate efficient differentiation of MSCs into ECs by inducing medium in vitro. MSCs were isolated from bone marrow by density gradient centrifugation. The characterisation of the MSCs was determined by their cluster of differentiation (CD) marker profile. Inducing medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), ascorbic acid, and heparin was applied to differentiate the MSCs into ECs. Endothelial differentiation was quantitatively evaluated using flow cytometry. Real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyse mRNA expression of endothelial markers. Tube formation assay was further performed to examine the functional status of the differentiated MSCs. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that CD31<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells increased steadily from 12% at 3 days, to 40% at 7 days, and to 60% at 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed the expression of CD31 and CD34. qRT-PCR showed that expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) were significantly higher in the induced MSCs group compared with the uninduced MSCs group. The functional behavior of the differentiated cells was tested by tube formation assay in vitro on matrigel. Induced MSCs were capable of developing capillary networks, and progressive formation of vessel like structures was associated with increased EC population. These results provide a method to efficiently promote differentiation of MSCs into ECs in vitro for potential application in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease.",

Methods This retrospective immunohistochemical study analysed archival samples of pathologically-confirmed specimens of low- and high-grade ureteral cancer, ureteral papilloma and ureteral polyps. The samples were immunohistochemically stained for cluster of differentiation (CD)4, CD8, CD16, CD25, CD56 and CD68 using immunofluorescence in order to identify different T-lymphocyte populations and macrophages. Results A total of 70 specimens were included in the analysis: 21 specimens of ureteral cancer, 17 specimens of ureteral papilloma, and 32 specimens of ureteral polyps. The largest proportion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells was observed in the low-grade ureteral cancer group and almost none were observed in ureteral papillomas. The largest proportion of CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes was observed in the ureteral polyps. The largest proportion of CD56+ natural killer cells was detected in the ureteral polyps, with very low levels observed in the other three groups. The largest proportion of CD16+CD68+ macrophages was observed in the high-grade ureteral cancer group, which was significantly higher than that observed in the ureteral papillomas.

The marked preponderance of childhood B-ALL in our series is, at least partly, attributable to the age distribution of the Tunisian population. In agreement with studies from other countries, the majority of AML cases occurred among adults. A high proportion of AML cases in our series co-expressed markers of other lineages.

The fixed-dose STR combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor dolutegravir with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine. In two phase III non-inferiority trials (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) in treatment-experienced patients already virologically suppressed on their current antiretroviral (ART) regimen, switching to once-daily dolutegravir plus rilpivirine maintained virological suppression over 48 weeks. Switching to a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir plus rilpivirine was also associated with high rates of virological suppression in real-world observational studies. Switching to once-daily dolutegravir plus rilpivirine was generally well tolerated and associated with more favourable renal and bone parameters than remaining on the current ART regimen. Longer-term, dolutegravir plus rilpivirine demonstrated durable maintenance of virological suppression and remained generally well tolerated for up to 100 weeks.

Several studies have shown an increased expression/release of Th17 related cytokine, IL-17A in ASD. IL-17A may enhance neuroinflammation via its IL-17A receptor, i.e. IL-17RA expressed in immune cells (such as monocytes) of autistic children. Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. However, whether IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling contributes to oxidative inflammation in monocytes of autistic children has not been explored previously. With this background, we performed this study in peripheral monocytes of ASD patients and age-matched typically developing children. Our study shows that ASD individuals have increased IL-17RA expression in monocytes which is associated with increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB) pathway and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitrotyrosine expression as compared to typically developing children. Moreover, in vitro activation of IL-17 receptor by IL-17A in monocytes isolated from ASD individuals leads to enhanced iNOS expression via NF\u03baB pathway. IL-17RA antibody treatment in vitro reversed IL-17A-induced increase in NF\u03baB and iNOS/nitrotyrosine expression in monocytes isolated from ASD subjects. These data connect increased IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling in ASD patients with enhanced oxidative inflammation in monocytes. Therefore, IL-17 receptor signaling in monocytes may potentiate the effects of IL-17A released by other immune cells and may aggravate neuroinflammation in ASD. Our study further suggests that blockade of IL-17A/IL-17 receptor signaling may be beneficial in the children with ASD.",

However, after antigen clearance, the expanded LVs shrink to maintain homeostasis. Here we show that interleukin (IL)-17A, secreted from T helper type 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cells, is a negative regulator of lymphangiogenesis during the resolution phase of T<sub>H</sub>17-mediated immune responses. Moreover, IL-17A suppresses the expression of major lymphatic markers in lymphatic endothelial cells and decreases in vitro LV formation. To investigate the role of IL-17A in vivo, we utilized a cholera toxin-mediated inflammation model and identified inflammation and resolution phases based on the numbers of recruited immune cells. IL-17A, markedly produced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells even after the peak of inflammation, was found to participate in the negative regulation of LV formation. Moreover, blockade of IL-17A resulted in not only increased density of LVs in tissues but also their enhanced function.

Prevention and treatment of GVHD remain inadequate and commonly lead to end-organ dysfunction and opportunistic infection. The role of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 in GVHD remains uncertain, due to an apparent lack of lineage fidelity and variable and contextually determined protective and pathogenic effects. We demonstrate that donor T cell-derived IL-22 significantly exacerbates cutaneous chronic GVHD and that IL-22 is produced by highly inflammatory donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells posttransplantation. IL-22 and IL-17A derive from both independent and overlapping lineages, defined as T helper (Th)22 and IL-22<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells. Donor Th22 and IL-22<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells share a similar IL-6-dependent developmental pathway, and while Th22 cells arise independently of the IL-22<sup>+</sup> Th17 lineage, IL-17 signaling to donor Th22 directly promotes their development in allo-SCT. Importantly, while both IL-22 and IL-17 mediate skin GVHD, Th17-induced chronic GVHD can be attenuated by IL-22 inhibition in preclinical systems. In the clinic, high levels of both IL-17A and IL-22 expression are present in the skin of patients with GVHD after allo-SCT. Together, these data demonstrate a key role for donor-derived IL-22 in patients with chronic skin GVHD and confirm parallel but symbiotic developmental pathways of Th22 and Th17 differentiation.",

The novel immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) presents as the therapeutic 'Holly Grail' in lung cancer treatment. Preclinical models provide evidence of immunotherapy-radiotherapy (IM-RT) synergy. The exposure to ionizing radiation turns tumor in an in-situ vaccine, primes the innate immune system, increases immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of immune-resistant tumors and promotes a systemic, out-of-field antitumor T-cell-mediated response called abscopal effect. The immunomodulatory and abscopal effects of radiotherapy can be further enhanced by combining with systemic immunotherapies. The phase III START trial proved that liposomal vaccine - tecemotide (L-BLP25) administered as maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LA-NSCLC prolongs survival. In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. PACIFIC trial results are expected to definitely establish durvalumab as standard consolidation strategy in LA-NSCLC.

Clinical and demographic characteristics, response, and toxicity data were compared between both groups. A total of 23 studies reported between 2013 and 2016 were eligible for analysis. The total number of patients evaluated for toxicities was 3284 patients in the PD-1 group and 2460 patients in the PD-L1 group. The baseline patient characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, although there was a trend toward increased squamous histology in the group treated with PD-L1 (32% vs 25%; P = .6). There was no difference in response rate noted between PD-1 (19%) and PD-L1 (18.6%) inhibitors (P = .17).

Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main problem with checkpoint blockers is that only a fraction of patients respond to the therapy. Insufficient immune activation is considered as one of the main reason for low response rates and combination of checkpoint blockers has been proposed to increase the response rates. The combination of checkpoint blockers was successful in melanoma but had significant adverse events. A combination that is selected based on the mechanistic differences between checkpoints and the differences in expression of checkpoints and their ligands in the tumor microenvironment could have a synergistic effect in a given cancer subtype and also have a manageable safety profile.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19008962": " The urokinase receptor (uPAR/CD87) is highly expressed in malignant tumours. uPAR, as a GPI anchored protein, is preferentially located at the cell surface, where it interacts with its ligands urokinase (uPA) and the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin, thus promoting plasmin generation, cell-matrix interactions and intracellular signalling events. Interaction with a complex formed by uPA and its inhibitor PAI-1 induces cell surface down regulation and recycling of the receptor via the clathrin-coated pathway, a process dependent on the association to LRP-1. In this study, we have found that along with the ligand-induced down-regulation, uPAR also internalizes and recycles constitutively through a second pathway that is independent of LRP-1 and clathrin but shares some properties with macropinocytosis. The ligand-independent route is amiloride-sensitive, does not require uPAR partitioning into lipid rafts, is independent of the activity of small GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, and does not require PI3K activity. Constitutively endocytosed uPAR is found in EEA1 positive early/recycling endosomes but does not reach lysosomes in the absence of ligands. Electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of uPAR in ruffling domains at the cell surface, in macropinosome-like vesicles and in endosomal compartments. These results indicate that, in addition to the ligand-induced endocytosis of uPAR, efficient surface expression and membrane trafficking might also be driven by an uncommon macropinocytic mechanism coupled with rapid recycling to the cell surface.",

Here we investigated whether direct interaction between uPAR, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, and LRP, a transmembrane receptor, is required for clearance of uPA:PAI-1, regeneration of unoccupied uPAR, activation of plasminogen, and the ability of HT1080 cells to invade extracellular matrix. We found that in the absence of uPA:PAI-1, uPAR is randomly distributed along the plasma membrane, whereas uPA:PAI-1 promotes formation of uPAR-LRP complexes and initiates redistribution of occupied uPAR to clathrin-coated pits. uPAR-LRP complexes are endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles and traffic together to early endosomes (EE) because they can be coimmunoprecipitated from immunoisolated EE, and internalization is blocked by depletion of intracellular K(+). Direct binding of domain 3 (D3) of uPAR to LRP is required for clearance of uPA-PAI-1-occupied uPAR because internalization is blocked by incubation with recombinant D3. Moreover, uPA-dependent plasmin generation and the ability of HT1080 cells to migrate through Matrigel-coated invasion chambers are also inhibited in the presence of D3. These results demonstrate that GPI-anchored uPAR is endocytosed by piggybacking on LRP and that direct binding of occupied uPAR to LRP is essential for internalization of occupied uPAR, regeneration of unoccupied uPAR, plasmin generation, and invasion and migration through extracellular matrix.",

Child weight status is measured by a full distribution of child weight, from severely thin to obese, using data from a z-score for body mass index and cognition is measured by the Spanish version of the Picture Peabody Vocabulary Test (PPVT). This relationship is studied at age five and age eight (school age), and disaggregated across socioeconomic factors of gender, urban/rural setting and indigenous/nonindigenous status. The initial results suggests that obese children have higher cognitive scores and that this result is driven by those who are female, non-indigenous and live in an urban region. However, after correcting for possible bias due to unobservable heterogeneity, there is little evidence of this relationship. The one exception is for a weakly significant relationship between obese female children and higher cognition, a relationship which tends to weaken between the ages of five and eight. On the other end of the weight distribution, indigenous children who are severely thin or thin have significantly lower cognitive scores, a relationship that holds after correcting for possible bias and appears to strengthen between ages of five and eight.

In a second search, we added key words related to neuropathology including words \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"vascular dementia,\" and \"mild cognitive impairment.\" The data suggest that being overweight or obese in midlife may be more detrimental to subsequent age-related cognitive decline than being overweight or obese at later stages of the life span. These effects are likely mediated by the accelerated effects obesity has on the integrity of neural structures, including both gray and white matter. Further epidemiological studies have provided evidence that obesity in midlife is linked to an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, most likely via an increased accumulation of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Although it is clear that obesity negatively affects cognition, more work is needed to better understand how aging plays a role and how brain structure and brain function might mediate the relationship of obesity and age on cognition.

Cognitive function was ascertained using the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and obesity using anthropometric measures including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI). Poor cognitive performance was present in 37% of the sample. General obesity (BMI &gt; or = 25) and poor cognition were strongly associated in the presence of abdominal obesity. Poor cognition was negatively associated with overweight (BMI 23-25) with normal waist circumference. Interaction terms with abdominal obesity for BMI increase were significant (p = 0.007). Obesity was associated with poor cognition, and obesity indexes must be carefully considered to reveal this relationship.",

Here, we examined age, years of education, schizophrenia, and gender differences which might affect the relationship between obesity and cognition. 1012 healthy controls and 707 participants with schizophrenia were recruited. Information on body mass index (BMI) was obtained and a neurocognitive battery was administered. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to examine the relationship between BMI, schizophrenia, cognition and its covariates. No significant direct effect of BMI on cognition was found when cognition was regressed on age, years of education, diagnosis of schizophrenia and BMI. Instead, two SEM models indicated that indirect effects between BMI and cognition exist. The indirect effect of BMI on cognition through schizophrenia was present in both genders, while the indirect effect of cognition on BMI through schizophrenia was only found in females. BMI affecting cognition through age, years of education and schizophrenia appears to be the most plausible model that explains the data. This indirect effect was larger in females and was masked by diagnosis of schizophrenia. With increased rates of obesity in schizophrenia, it is important to highlight the potentially deleterious effect of obesity on cognition. BMI could be used as a candidate risk marker to identify people at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and as an intervention target for modifications of cognitive outcomes.",

Individuals with mood disorders (bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD)) display an increased prevalence of both obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, BD and MDD are associated with impairment in cognitive functioning across multiple domains. The independent contribution of obesity to cognitive decline in this population has not been explored. This study examines the impact of obesity on cognition by comparing neuropsychological performance in obese individuals, with or without a mood disorder before and after undergoing bariatric surgery. This study compares measures of declarative memory, executive functioning and attention in obese individuals (body mass index &gt;35 kg/m(2)) with BD or MDD, and 2 control populations (obese individuals without a psychiatric illness and healthy non-obese controls) prior to and following bariatric surgery. Participants (ages 18-60) receive a psychiatric diagnosis via the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; SCID). Mood ratings, physical measurements, nutritional and health questionnaires are also administered. A standardised battery of neuropsychological tests aimed at establishing performance in areas of declarative memory, executive functioning and attention are administered. Warrington's Recognition Memory Task (RMT) and an N-Back Task are performed in a 3 T functional MRI to investigate patterns of neural activation during cognitive performance. Additionally, anatomical MRI data are obtained to investigate potential changes in neural structures. Baseline data will be analysed for between-group differences and later compared with postsurgical data to investigate cognitive change. This study has been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (09-3254). Results will be available in peer-reviewed scientific publications and scientific meetings presentations, and released in lay form to media.",

There is also an association between body mass index (BMI) and cognitive ability. Since low birth weight is associated with adult metabolic disease, particularly in obese subjects, the question emerges whether obesity has an additional negative effect on cognitive function in subjects with low birth weight. The aim was to analyse whether overweight or obesity influence intellectual performance in young adults with particular focus on those with a low birth weight. Data were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register on 620,834 males born between 1973 and 1988 and matched to results on intellectual performance and BMI at conscription. The risk for low intellectual performance was higher for those with high BMI compared to those with normal. The highest risk was found among subjects with low birth weight and overweight or obesity in young adulthood (odds ratios, 1.98 [1.73-2.22] and 2.59 [2.00-3.34], respectively). However, subjects with further high birth weight and a high BMI at conscription had no further increased risk. Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of subnormal intellectual performance in young adult males. Subjects with low birth weight and adolescent overweight/obesity are at particular risk of subnormal performance. A high birth weight increases the risk for obesity, but a high adult BMI does not further increase the risk for subnormal performance.",

The brain plays a critical role in regulating energy balance. Some human studies have demonstrated increased preference for high fat and high sugar foods in people reporting greater stress exposure. We have examined neurochemical changes in the brain in rodent models during the development of obesity, including the impact of obesity on cognition, reward neurocircuitry and stress responsiveness. Using supermarket foods high in fat and sugar, we showed that such a diet leads to changes in neurotransmitters involved in the hedonic appraisal of foods, indicative of an addiction-like capacity of foods high in fat and/or sugar. Importantly, withdrawal of the palatable diet led to a stress-like response. Furthermore, access to this palatable diet attenuated the physiological effects of acute stress (restraint), indicating that it could act as a comfort food. In more chronic studies, the diet also attenuated anxiety-like behavior in rats exposed to stress (maternal separation) early in life, but these rats may suffer greater metabolic harm than rats exposed to the early life stressor but not provided with the palatable diet. Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents. However, as little as 1 week of exposure to a high fat, high sugar diet selectively impaired place but not object recognition memory in the rat. Excess sugar alone had similar effects, and both diets were linked to increased inflammatory markers in the hippocampus, a critical region involved in memory. Obesity-related inflammatory changes have been found in the human brain. Ongoing work examines interventions to prevent or reverse diet-induced cognitive impairments. These data have implications for minimizing harm caused by unhealthy eating.",

The sample was the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 12,349 participants). Boys with obesity at 3 years had significantly lower performance in pattern construction at age 5 years compared to those of a healthy weight, even after controlling for confounders (\u03b2 = -0.029, P = 0.03).

There is parallel evidence that people who are overweight or obese tend to perform worse on a variety of cognitive tasks. In this review, the evidence for these two ideas is summarised and then the idea that overconsumption of Western-style high-fat (HF)-high-sugar diets may underlie the association between obesity and poorer cognitive performance is explored. In particular, evidence in animals and human subjects that repeated consumption of HF or HF and sugar (HFS) diets leads to specific impairments in the functioning of the hippocampus, which underpin the consequent changes in cognition is summarised. These findings lead into the vicious cycle model (VCM), which suggests that these cognitive changes have knock-on negative effects for future appetite control, and evidence that altered hippocampal function is also associated with impaired appetite control is explored. The review concludes that there is consistent evidence in the animal literature and emerging evidence from human studies that supports this VCM. It is also noted, however, that to date studies lack the nutritional specificity needed to be able to translate these basic research findings into clear nutritional effects, and concludes that there is an urgent need for additional research to clarify the precise nature of the apparent effects of consuming HFS diets on cognition.",

This special issue of Psychosomatic Medicine features the latest research linking diabetes, obesity, and brain structure, function, and metabolism and follows a special meeting on this topic organized by the American Psychosomatic Society in October 2013. Evidence for the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity is reviewed as it relates to cognitive decline. These articles indicate that the age of onset of Type 1 diabetes may be relevant to future cognitive function and that disease duration of Type 2 diabetes and sociocultural factors are related to cognitive decline during the aging process. The hypothalamus and other neural circuits, notably the dopaminergic system that underlies feeding and reward-related aspects of food intake, are among the key factors involved in obesity. Research on the associations between obesity and cognitive function is described using the positive effects of weight reduction following bariatric surgery or behavioral methods. This special issue concludes with a conceptual framework for linking obesity and diabetes with accelerated cognitive decline as related to the aging process. The collection of articles highlights the importance of using a life span perspective to understand the influence of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes on brain metabolism, function, and structure.

All the patients had a viral load of more than 1000 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter. After a 7-day control period in which patients continued to receive their current therapy, a loading dose of 2000 mg of ibalizumab was infused; the viral load was quantified 7 days later. Through week 25 of the study, patients received 800 mg of ibalizumab every 14 days, combined with an individually optimized background regimen including at least one fully active agent. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies per milliliter from baseline (day 7) to day 14. A total of 31 patients completed the study. The mean baseline viral load was 4.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies per milliliter, and the mean CD4 count was 150 per microliter.

Selected laboratories are required to have oversight, performance monitoring, and remediation undertaken by Immunology Quality Assessment (IQA) staff under the DAIDS contract. We examined whether laboratory accuracy improves with longer EQA participation and whether IQA remediation is effective. Laboratory accuracy, defined by the measurement residuals from trial sample medians, was measured on four outcomes: both CD4+ absolute counts (cells/\u03bcL) and percentages; and CD8+ absolute counts (cells/\u03bcL) and percentages. Three laboratory categories were defined: IQA monitored (n = 116), United Kingdom/non-DAIDS (n = 137), and non-DAIDS/non-UK (n = 1034). For absolute count outcomes, the groups were subdivided into single platform and dual platform users. Increasing EQA duration was found to be associated with increasing accuracy for all groups in all four lymphocyte subsets (P &lt; 0.0001). In the percentage outcomes, the typical IQA group laboratory improved faster than laboratories from the other two groups (P &lt; 0.005). No difference in the overall rate of improvement was found between groups for absolute count outcomes. However, in the DPT subgroup the IQA group ultimately showed greater homogeneity. EQA participation coupled with effective laboratory monitoring and remedial action is strongly associated with improved laboratory accuracy, both incrementally and in the proportion of laboratories meeting suggested standards.

Based on these results, immunophenotypes were distinguished by principal components analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis was used to classify SLE patients into subgroups. The proportions of Treg and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells were higher in SLE patients than in healthy controls, whereas Th1 and Th17 cell proportions did not differ. Proportions of class-switched memory B cells and IgD-CD27- B cells were increased in SLE patients as well. The largest difference compared to the control group was observed in the proportion of plasmablasts, which was higher in SLE patients and correlated with disease activity as assessed with the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index. PCA indicated that the immunophenotype of SLE patients consisted of abnormalities of the T and B cell axes. Cluster analysis showed that the SLE patients could be stratified into 3 subgroups (with high proportions of plasmablasts in all groups): patients who did not show the characteristic features (T cell-independent group), patients with a high percentage of Tfh cells (Tfh-dominant group), and patients with a high percentage of memory Treg cells (Treg-dominant group). The percentage of patients whose SLE was resistant to treatment was highest among the Tfh-dominant group. Our study indicates that patients with active SLE can be divided into 3 subgroups based on T cell heterogeneity.

Concordant cases were significantly less likely to have markers repeated than discordant cases. Of concordant B cell malignancies, 57% represented recurrent disease; however, repeat marker usage was not decreased as compared to new diagnoses.

Using the phase I-I/II study data, population pharmacokinetic and repeated time-to-event (RTTE) modeling were performed to quantitatively characterize the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab and reduction in bleeding frequency. Simulations were then performed to identify the minimal exposure expected to achieve zero bleeding events for 1 year in at least 50% of patients and to select the dosing regimens to be tested in phase III studies. The RTTE model adequately predicted the bleeding onset over time as a function of plasma emicizumab concentration. Simulations suggested that plasma emicizumab concentrations of \u2265 45 \u03bcg/mL should result in zero bleeding events for 1 year in at least 50% of patients.

Adjusted clot waveform analyses using a prothrombin time (PT)/aPTT initiator were developed. Activity of Emi in the co-presence of factor VIII or bypassing agents was quantified. This assay is useful for assessing coagulation potential in Emi-treated hemophilia A. Background Emicizumab is an anti-activated factor IX/FX bispecific antibody that mimics activated FVIII cofactor function. Emicizumab does not require activation by thrombin, and its effect on shortening the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is much greater than that of FVIII.

In contrast, enhanced coagulation potential appeared to be better defined by the clot time than by Ad|min1| in experiments using recombinant activated FVII. Conclusion The PT/APTT reagent-triggered adjusted CWA could provide a useful means of assessing global coagulation potential in emicizumab-treated HA patients, with enhanced activity neither masking nor being masked by FVIII or bypassing agents.",

Treatment of these disorders has focused on replacement of the missing coagulation factor to prevent or treat bleeding. New technologies and insights into hemostasis have driven the development of many promising new therapies for hemophilia and von Willebrand disease. Emerging bypass agents including zymogen-like factor IXa and Xa molecules are in development and a bispecific antibody, emicizumab, demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 trial in people with hemophilia A and inhibitors. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor, the protein C/S system, and antithrombin are targets of novel compounds in development to alter the hemostatic balance and new approaches using modified factor VIII molecules are being tested for prevention and eradication of inhibitor antibodies in hemophilia A.

A mixture of two anti-Emi monoclonal antibodies (mAb) effectively neutralized the Emi activity. Anti-Emi mAbs completely eliminated the influence of Emi on FVIII activity and inhibitor titer. The inclusion of anti-Emi mAbs in routine FVIII assays would be useful for Emi-treated patients. Background Emicizumab is an anti-factor (F)IXa/X bispecific monoclonal antibody (mAb), mimicking the factor (F)VIIIa cofactor activity. Emicizumab does not require activation by thrombin and its shortening effect on the activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) is more pronounced than that of factor (F)VIII. APTT-based FVIII activity (FVIII:C) and FVIII inhibiter titer measurements are influenced by the presence of emicizumab. Aim To establish a reliable APTT-based assay to measure FVIII in the presence of emicizumab. Methods Plasmas from hemophilia A (HA) patients without or with inhibitors were studied using one-stage FVIII:C and Bethesda inhibitor assays. Two recombinant anti-idiotype mAbs to emicizumab (anti-emicizumab mAbs) were prepared, rcAQ8 to anti-FIXa-Fab and rcAJ540 to anti-FX-Fab. Results The combined anti-idiotype mAbs (2000 nm each) eliminated the effects of emicizumab on APTTs of HA plasmas without or with inhibitor by competitive inhibition of antibody binding to FIX(a)/FX(a). Measurements of FVIII coagulation activity in HA plasmas without inhibitor were overestimated in the presence of emicizumab (1 \u03bcm = ~150 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup> ) at all reference levels of FVIII. The addition of anti-emicizumab mAbs to the assay mixtures completely neutralized the emicizumab and facilitated accurate determination of FVIII:C. Anti-FVIII inhibitor titers were undetectable in the presence of emicizumab in HA plasmas with inhibitor or normal plasmas mixed with anti-FVIII neutralizing antibodies. These effects of emicizumab were completely counteracted by the addition of the anti-idiotype mAbs, allowing accurate assessment of inhibitor titers. Conclusion The in vitro inclusion of anti-emicizumab mAbs in the standard one-stage coagulation assays prevented interference by emicizumab and enabled accurate measurements of FVIII:C and inhibitor titers.",

Safety concerns may exist when combining emicizumab with bypassing agents. Combined bypassing agent and bispecific antibody increased thrombin generation up to 17-fold. Thrombotic effects should be considered when combining emicizumab with plasma bypassing agent. Background Investigational non-factor products such as emicizumab offer a treatment option for patients with hemophilia and inhibitors. However, their mechanism of action raises questions regarding safety when they are combined with treatments for breakthrough bleeding. Objectives To evaluate in vitro thrombin generation (TG) and clot formation for combinations of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC), recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), and a sequence-identical analog of emicizumab (SIA). Methods Therapeutic concentrations of SIA (20-600 nm) alone or with aPCC (0.05-1 U mL<sup>-1</sup> ), isolated aPCC components or rFVIIa (0.88-5.25 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup> ) were tested for TG and compared with reference ranges for healthy donor plasma. Coagulation of FVIII-inhibited blood was determined with a widely established method, i.e. rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and confirmed with the Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System. Results and conclusions SIA (600 nm) or aPCC (0.5 U mL<sup>-1</sup> ) alone resulted in peak thrombin levels of 21.4 nm and 38.6 nm, respectively, both of which are lower than normal (83.7 \u00b1 29.8 nm). SIA plus aPCC (0.5 U mL<sup>-1</sup> ) increased the peak thrombin level 17-fold over SIA alone, exceeding the reference plasma value by 4.2-fold. This hypercoagulable effect occurred with 600 nmSIA combined with as little as 0.25 U mL<sup>-1</sup> aPCC, confirmed by ROTEM. FIX was the main driver for enhanced TG. SIA plus rFVIIa (1.75 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup> ) induced a 1.8-fold increase in the peak thrombin level in platelet-rich plasma, but it did not reach the normal range. These in vitro experiments demonstrate excessive TG after administration of a combination of aPCC and SIA at clinically relevant doses.

However, clinical trials of nonselective kinase inhibitors with c-Met activity (tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and golvatinib) in patients with HCC have failed so far to demonstrate significant efficacy. This lack of observed efficacy is likely due to several factors, including trial design, lack of patient selection according to tumor c-Met status, and the prevalent off-target activity of these agents, which may indicate that c-Met inhibition is incomplete. In contrast, selective c-Met inhibitors (tepotinib, capmatinib) can be dosed at a level predicted to achieve complete inhibition of tumor c-Met activity. Moreover, results from early trials can be used to optimize the design of clinical trials of these agents. Preliminary results suggest that selective c-Met inhibitors have antitumor activity in HCC, with acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with Child-Pugh A liver function. Ongoing trials have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of selective c-Met inhibition compared with standard therapy in patients with HCC that were selected based on tumor c-Met status.

This randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial evaluated cabozantinib as compared with placebo in previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients had received previous treatment with sorafenib, had disease progression after at least one systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, and may have received up to two previous systemic regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and the objective response rate. At the second planned interim analysis, the trial showed significantly longer overall survival with cabozantinib than with placebo. Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005).

Mutations in Esco2 cause Roberts syndrome, a developmental disease characterized by severe prenatal retardation as well as limb and facial abnormalities. However, its exact roles during oocyte meiosis have not clearly defined. Here, we report that Esco2 localizes to the chromosomes during oocyte meiotic maturation. Depletion of Esco2 by morpholino microinjection leads to the precocious polar body extrusion, the escape of metaphase I arrest induced by nocodazole treatment and the loss of BubR1 from kinetochores, indicative of inactivated SAC. Furthermore, depletion of Esco2 causes a severely impaired spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, accompanied by the remarkably elevated incidence of defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments which consequently lead to the generation of aneuploid eggs. Notably, we find that the involvement of Esco2 in SAC and kinetochore functions is mediated by its binding to histone H4 and acetylation of H4K16 both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, our data assign a novel meiotic function to Esco2 beyond its role in the cohesion establishment during mouse oocyte meiosis.",

We previously reported that mTORC1 signaling was depressed and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells and zebrafish models for RBS. Treatment of RBS cells and zebrafish RBS models with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division and improved development. In this study, we use RBS cells to model mTORC1 repression and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine gene-level effects of L-leucine. L-leucine treatment partially rescued translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, snoRNA production, and mitochondrial function in RBS cells, consistent with these processes being mTORC1 controlled. In contrast, other genes are differentially expressed independent of L-leucine treatment, including imprinted genes such as H19 and GTL2, miRNAs regulated by GTL2, HOX genes, and genes in nucleolar associated domains. Our study distinguishes between gene expression changes in RBS cells that are TOR dependent and those that are independent. Some of the TOR independent gene expression changes likely reflect the architectural role of cohesin in chromatin looping and gene expression.

These birth defects are collectively termed cohesinopathies as both arise from mutations in cohesion genes. CdLS arises due to autosomal dominant mutations or haploinsufficiencies in cohesin subunits (<i>SMC1A</i>, <i>SMC3</i> and <i>RAD21</i>) or cohesin auxiliary factors (<i>NIPBL</i> and <i>HDAC8</i>) that result in transcriptional dysregulation of developmental programs. RBS arises due to autosomal recessive mutations in cohesin auxiliary factor <i>ESCO2</i>, the gene that encodes an N-acetyltransferase which targets the SMC3 subunit of the cohesin complex. The mechanism that underlies RBS, however, remains unknown. A popular model states that RBS arises due to mitotic failure and loss of progenitor stem cells through apoptosis. Previous findings in the zebrafish regenerating fin, however, suggest that Esco2<i>-</i>knockdown results in transcription dysregulation, independent of apoptosis, similar to that observed in CdLS patients. Previously, we used the clinically relevant <i>CX43</i> to demonstrate a transcriptional role for Esco2. <i>CX43</i> is a gap junction gene conserved among all vertebrates that is required for direct cell-cell communication between adjacent cells such that <i>cx43</i> mutations result in oculodentodigital dysplasia.

Also similar to Esco2-dependent phenotypes, Smc3-dependent bone and tissue regeneration defects are rescued by transgenic Cx43 overexpression, suggesting that Smc3 and Esco2 cooperatively act to regulate cx43 transcription. In support of this model, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that Smc3 binds to a discrete region of the <i>cx43</i> promoter, suggesting that Esco2 exerts transcriptional regulation of <i>cx43</i> through modification of Smc3 bound to the <i>cx43</i> promoter.

The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77% of patients, 48% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported. In this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade toxic effects.

The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel targets and eliminates CD19-expressing B cells and showed efficacy against B-cell lymphomas in a single-center, phase 2a study. We conducted an international, phase 2, pivotal study of centrally manufactured tisagenlecleucel involving adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were ineligible for or had disease progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary end point was the best overall response rate (i.e., the percentage of patients who had a complete or partial response), as judged by an independent review committee. A total of 93 patients received an infusion and were included in the evaluation of efficacy. The median time from infusion to data cutoff was 14 months (range, 0.1 to 26). The best overall response rate was 52% (95% confidence interval, 41 to 62); 40% of the patients had complete responses, and 12% had partial responses. Response rates were consistent across prognostic subgroups. At 12 months after the initial response, the rate of relapse-free survival was estimated to be 65% (79% among patients with a complete response). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events of special interest included cytokine release syndrome (22%), neurologic events (12%), cytopenias lasting more than 28 days (32%), infections (20%), and febrile neutropenia (14%). Three patients died from disease progression within 30 days after infusion. No deaths were attributed to tisagenlecleucel, cytokine release syndrome, or cerebral edema. No differences between response groups in tumor expression of CD19 or immune checkpoint-related proteins were found. In this international study of CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults, high rates of durable responses were produced with the use of tisagenlecleucel.

This was a milestone in tumor immunology on account of the significant antitumor effect of tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-ALL patients. Conventional standard therapies for B-ALL have high failure rates, thus developing new therapies is crucial for patients with B-ALL. Results from clinical trials indicate that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies could successfully induce high response rates in B-ALL patients. However, related toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome, may be severe or even fatal, and the management of such toxicities is therefore vital. This review will focus on the clinical application of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in B-ALL treatment, including design features of CAR constructs, therapeutic use of tisagenlecleucel, CAR T-cell therapy clinical trials and related toxicity, and prospects for cancer immunotherapy.",

On August 30, 2017, the FDA approved tisagenlecleucel for treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory in second or later relapse. Approval was based on the complete remission (CR) rate, durability of CR, and minimal residual disease (MRD) &lt;0.01% in a cohort of 63 children and young adults with relapsed or refractory ALL treated on a single-arm trial (CCTL019B2202). Treatment consisted of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed 2 to 14 days later by a single dose of tisagenlecleucel. The CR rate was 63% (95% confidence interval, 50%-75%), and all CRs had MRD &lt;0.01%. With a median follow-up of 4.8 months, the median duration of response was not reached. Cytokine release syndrome (79%) and neurologic events (65%) were serious toxicities reported in the trial. With implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, the benefit-risk profile was considered acceptable for this patient population with such resistant ALL.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111196": "Cure rates for pediatric and young adult patients with refractory or recurrently relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are dismal. Survival from time of relapse is typically measured in weeks to months, and standard chemotherapy and currently approved targeted therapy achieve remission in less than a third of affected patients. To date, the only definitive curative therapy has been allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Advances in immunotherapy, with the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and the development of tisagenlecleucel, have changed the landscape. Areas covered: This review will describe the pharmacology of tisagenlecleucel and summarize the clinical evidence for its use in the treatment of multiple-relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Also discussed are other immunotherapies for B-ALL as well as the most commonly-encountered toxicities and corresponding management strategies. Expert commentary: Early phase trials indicate that tisagenlecleucel significantly improves survival for patients with B-ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. In responding patients, remissions have been reported on the order of years, and thus, tisagenlecleucel may herald a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm of this largely fatal disease.",

We evaluated the cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel, the effect of patient factors, humoral immunogenicity, and manufacturing attributes on its kinetics, and exposure-response analysis for efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints in 79 patients across two studies in pediatric B-ALL (ELIANA and ENSIGN). Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to quantify levels of tisagenlecleucel transgene, responders (<i>N</i> = 62) had \u22482-fold higher tisagenlecleucel expansion in peripheral blood than nonresponders (<i>N</i> = 8; 74% and 104% higher geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-28d, respectively) with persistence measurable beyond 2 years in responding patients. Cmax increased with occurrence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Tisagenlecleucel continued to expand and persist following tocilizumab, used to manage CRS. Patients with B-cell recovery within 6 months had earlier loss of the transgene compared with patients with sustained clinical response. Clinical responses were seen across the entire dose range evaluated (patients \u226450 kg: 0.2 to 5.0 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>/kg; patients &gt;50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> CAR-positive viable T cells) with no relationship between dose and safety. Neither preexisting nor treatment-induced antimurine CAR19 antibodies affected the persistence or clinical response. Response to tisagenlecleucel was associated with increased expansion across a wide dose range.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846097": "Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a distant member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 family, is a secreted protein that circulates as a 25-kDa dimer. In humans, elevated GDF15 correlates with weight loss, and the administration of GDF15 to mice with obesity reduces body weight, at least in part, by decreasing food intake. The mechanisms through which GDF15 reduces body weight remain poorly understood, because the cognate receptor for GDF15 is unknown. Here we show that recombinant GDF15 induces weight loss in mice fed a high-fat diet and in nonhuman primates with spontaneous obesity. Furthermore, we find that GDF15 binds with high affinity to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL), a distant relative of receptors for a distinct class of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands. Gfral is expressed in neurons of the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract in mice and humans, and genetic deletion of the receptor abrogates the ability of GDF15 to decrease food intake and body weight in mice. In addition, diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are exacerbated in GFRAL-deficient mice, suggesting a homeostatic role for this receptor in metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate that GDF15-induced cell signaling requires the interaction of GFRAL with the coreceptor RET. Our data identify GFRAL as a new regulator of body weight and as the bona fide receptor mediating the metabolic effects of GDF15, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of GDF15 as a potential pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity.",

However, the cognate receptor of GDF15 is unknown. Here we show that GDF15 binds specifically to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL) with high affinity, and that GFRAL requires association with the coreceptor RET to elicit intracellular signaling in response to GDF15 stimulation. We also found that GDF15-mediated reductions in food intake and body weight of mice with obesity were abolished in GFRAL-knockout mice. We further found that GFRAL expression was limited to hindbrain neurons and not present in peripheral tissues, which suggests that GDF15-GFRAL-mediated regulation of food intake is by a central mechanism. Lastly, given that GDF15 did not increase energy expenditure in treated mice with obesity, the anti-obesity actions of the cytokine are likely driven primarily by a reduction in food intake.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846098": "Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), also known as MIC-1, is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily and has been implicated in various biological functions, including cancer cachexia, renal and heart failure, atherosclerosis and metabolism. A connection between GDF15 and body-weight regulation was initially suggested on the basis of an observation that increasing GDF15 levels in serum correlated with weight loss in individuals with advanced prostate cancer. In animal models, overexpression of GDF15 leads to a lean phenotype, hypophagia and other improvements in metabolic parameters, suggesting that recombinant GDF15 protein could potentially be used in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the signaling and mechanism of action of GDF15 are poorly understood owing to the absence of a clearly identified cognate receptor. Here we report that GDNF-family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL), an orphan member of the GFR-\u03b1 family, is a high-affinity receptor for GDF15. GFRAL binds to GDF15 in vitro and is required for the metabolic actions of GDF15 with respect to body weight and food intake in vivo in mice. Gfral<sup>-/-</sup> mice were refractory to the effects of recombinant human GDF15 on body-weight, food-intake and glucose parameters. Blocking the interaction between GDF15 and GFRAL with a monoclonal antibody prevented the metabolic effects of GDF15 in rats. Gfral mRNA is highly expressed in the area postrema of mouse, rat and monkey, in accordance with previous reports implicating this region of the brain in the metabolic actions of GDF15 (refs. 4,5,6). Together, our data demonstrate that GFRAL is a receptor for GDF15 that mediates the metabolic effects of GDF15.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28953886": "Under homeostatic conditions, animals use well-defined hypothalamic neural circuits to help maintain stable body weight, by integrating metabolic and hormonal signals from the periphery to balance food consumption and energy expenditure. In stressed or disease conditions, however, animals use alternative neuronal pathways to adapt to the metabolic challenges of altered energy demand. Recent studies have identified brain areas outside the hypothalamus that are activated under these 'non-homeostatic' conditions, but the molecular nature of the peripheral signals and brain-localized receptors that activate these circuits remains elusive. Here we identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) as a brainstem-restricted receptor for growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 regulates food intake, energy expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses; we show that Gfral knockout mice are hyperphagic under stressed conditions and are resistant to chemotherapy-induced anorexia and body weight loss. GDF15 activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized exclusively in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the mouse brainstem. It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitute part of the 'emergency circuit' that shapes feeding responses to stressful conditions. GDF15 levels increase in response to tissue stress and injury, and elevated levels are associated with body weight loss in numerous chronic human diseases. By isolating GFRAL as the receptor for GDF15-induced anorexia and weight loss, we identify a mechanistic basis for the non-homeostatic regulation of neural circuitry by a peripheral signal associated with tissue damage and stress. These findings provide opportunities to develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders with altered energy demand.",

Four laboratories have recently identified GFRAL, an orphan receptor of the glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor \u03b1 family, as the receptor for MIC-1/GDF15, signaling though the coreceptor Ret.
