Using Caenorhabditis elegans early embryos and Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we show that the E3 ligase CUL-2<sup>LRR-1</sup> associates with the replisome and drives ubiquitylation and disassembly of CMG, together with the CDC-48 cofactors UFD-1 and NPL-4. Removal of CMG from chromatin in frog egg extracts requires CUL2 neddylation, and our data identify chromatin recruitment of CUL2<sup>LRR1</sup> as a key regulated step during DNA replication termination. Interestingly, however, CMG persists on chromatin until prophase in worms that lack CUL-2<sup>LRR-1</sup>, but is then removed by a mitotic pathway that requires the CDC-48 cofactor UBXN-3, orthologous to the human tumour suppressor FAF1. Partial inactivation of lrr-1 and ubxn-3 leads to synthetic lethality, suggesting future approaches by which a deeper understanding of CMG disassembly in metazoa could be exploited therapeutically.",

Here we show that a single amino-acid substitution in the trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomyces RNAP II, Rpb1 H1085Y, engenders a gain of intrinsic cleavage activity where the substituted tyrosine appears to participate in acid-base chemistry at alkaline pH for both intrinsic cleavage and nucleotidyl transfer. We extensively characterize this TL substitution for each of these reactions by examining the responses RNAP II enzymes to catalytic metals, altered pH, and factor inputs. We demonstrate that TFIIF stimulation of the first phosphodiester bond formation by RNAP II requires wild type TL function and that H1085Y substitution within the TL compromises or alters RNAP II responsiveness to both TFIIB and TFIIF. Finally, Mn(2+) stimulation of H1085Y RNAP II reveals possible allosteric effects of TFIIB on the active center and cooperation between TFIIB and TFIIF.",

Substitution of either of these residues inactivates both TFIIS functions, suggesting a related role in both activities. These acidic residues may participate in phosphoryl transfer reactions by a two-metal-ion mechanism in a manner analogous to Klenow fragment. The RNA polymerase II itself may contain a Zn ribbon, in as much as the polymerase's 15-kDa subunit contains a sequence that aligns well with the TFIIS Zn ribbon sequence, including a similarly placed pair of acidic residues.",

RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA, including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP from NTP. Both of these reactions are inhibited by alpha-amanitin. Hence, by several criteria the RNA in binary complexes is bound to the polymerase in a manner quite similar to that in ternary complexes in which the catalytic site for nucleotide addition is positioned at or near the 3'-OH terminus of the RNA. These findings are consistent with a model for the RNA polymerase ternary complex in which the RNA is bound at the 3' terminus through two protein-binding sites located up to 10 nt apart.",

Transcription past these impediments requires SII, an RNA polymerase II-binding protein. SII also activates a nuclease in arrested elongation complexes and this nascent RNA shortening precedes transcriptional readthrough. Here we show that in the presence of SII and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation but not during SII-independent transcription. Thus, under typical transcription conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage. RNA cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation. By mapping the positions of the 3'-ends of RNAs and the elongation complex on DNA, we demonstrate that upstream movement of RNA polymerase II is not required for limited RNA shortening (seven to nine nucleotides) and reactivation of an arrested complex. Arrested complexes become elongation competent after removal of no more than nine nucleotides from the nascent RNA's 3'-end. Further cleavage of nascent RNA, however, does result in \"backward\" translocation of the enzyme. We also show that one round of RNA cleavage is insufficient for full readthrough at an arrest site, consistent with a previously suggested mechanism of SII action.",

(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). Here we show that SII-dependent in vitro transcription through an arrest site in a human gene is preceded by nascent transcript cleavage. RNA cleavage appeared to be an obligatory step in the SII activation process. Recombinant SII activated cleavage while a truncated derivative lacking polymerase binding activity did not. Cleavage was not restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes. These data support a model whereby SII stimulates elongation via a ribonuclease activity of the elongation complex.",

Photocross-linking was dependent upon the presence of SII, incorporation of 4-thio-UMP into RNA, and irradiation and was sensitive to treatment by RNase and proteinase. A transcriptionally active mutant of SII lacking the first 130 amino acids was also cross-linked to the nascent RNA, but SII from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is inactive in concert with mammalian RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in the enzyme's active site.",

This intrinsic cleavage activity is strong for Pol I and Pol III but very weak for Pol II. The reason for this difference is unclear because the active centers of the polymerases are virtually identical. Here we show that Pol II gains strong cleavage activity when the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain (C-ribbon) of subunit Rpb9 is replaced by its counterpart from the Pol III subunit C11. X-ray analysis shows that the C-ribbon has detached from its site on the Pol II surface and is mobile. Mutagenesis indicates that the C-ribbon transiently inserts into the Pol II pore to complement the active center. This mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol II and induce strong RNA cleavage. Together with published data, our results indicate that Pol I and Pol III contain catalytic C-ribbons that complement the active center, whereas Pol II contains a non-catalytic C-ribbon that is immobilized on the enzyme surface. Evolution of the Pol II system may have rendered mRNA transcript cleavage controllable by the dissociable factor transcription factor IIS to enable promoter-proximal gene regulation and elaborate 3'-processing and transcription termination.",

Rpb9, a small subunit of RNA polymerase II, enhances the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II. Here, we investigated the role of nascent transcript cleavage stimulation activity on the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity in yeast. In yeast, S-II is encoded by the DST1 gene. Disruption of the DST1 gene decreased transcriptional fidelity in cells. Mutations in the DST1 gene that reduce the S-II cleavage stimulation activity led to decreased transcriptional fidelity in cells. A disruption mutant of the RPB9 gene also had decreased transcriptional fidelity. Expression of mutant Rpb9 proteins that are unable to enhance the S-II cleavage stimulation activity failed to restore the phenotype. These results suggest that both S-II and Rpb9 maintain transcriptional fidelity by stimulating the cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. Also, a DST1 and RPB9 double mutant had more severe transcriptional fidelity defect compared with the DST1 gene deletion mutant, suggesting that Rpb9 maintains transcriptional fidelity via two mechanisms, enhancement of S-II dependent cleavage stimulation and S-II independent function(s).",

These elongation complexes are arrested at a previously identified, naturally occurring transcriptional pause site in a human gene. The new 3'-end revealed by this cleavage remains associated with an active elongation complex and is capable of being extended by RNA polymerase II. Nascent RNA cleavage is evident after removal of free nucleotides and is dependent upon a divalent metal cation and transcription elongation factor SII. This function of SII could be important in its function as an activator of transcription elongation.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12692127": "Transcript elongation can be interrupted by a variety of obstacles, including certain DNA sequences, DNA-binding proteins, chromatin, and DNA lesions. Bypass of many of these impediments is facilitated by elongation factor TFIIS through a mechanism that involves cleavage of the nascent transcript by the RNA polymerase II/TFIIS elongation complex. Highly purified yeast RNA polymerase II is able to perform transcript hydrolysis in the absence of TFIIS. The \"intrinsic\" cleavage activity is greatly stimulated at mildly basic pH and requires divalent cations. Both arrested and stalled complexes can carry out the intrinsic cleavage reaction, although not all stalled complexes are equally efficient at this reaction. Arrested complexes in which the nascent transcript was cleaved in the absence of TFIIS were reactivated to readthrough blocks to elongation. Thus, cleavage of the nascent transcript is sufficient for reactivating some arrested complexes. Small RNA products released following transcript cleavage in stalled ternary complexes differ depending upon whether the cleavage has been induced by TFIIS or has occurred in mildly alkaline conditions. In contrast, both intrinsic and TFIIS-induced small RNA cleavage products are very similar when produced from an arrested ternary complex. Although alpha-amanitin interferes with the transcript cleavage stimulated by TFIIS, it has little effect on the intrinsic cleavage reaction. A mutant RNA polymerase previously shown to be refractory to TFIIS-induced transcript cleavage is essentially identical to the wild type polymerase in all tested aspects of intrinsic cleavage.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26080409": "The analysis of chromatin structure is essential for the understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MPE-Fe(II) relative to MNase. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. The subnucleosome-sized MPE-seq peaks exhibit a particularly distinct association with active promoters. In addition, unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. In this regard, we found that DNA sequences at RNA splice sites are hypersensitive to digestion by MNase but not by MPE-Fe(II). This phenomenon may have affected the analysis of nucleosome occupancy over exons. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. In particular, the combined use of MPE-seq and MNase-seq enables the identification of noncanonical chromatin structures that are likely to be important for the regulation of gene expression.",

Chromatins, prepared by reconstitution with either chicken or frog histones, were separately digested to mononucleosomes using either micrococcal nuclease (MNase) or caspase-activated DNase (CAD). Both enzymes preferentially cleave internucleosomal (linker) DNA, although they do so by markedly different mechanisms. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. Having identified the locations and quantified the strength of both the chicken or frog histone octamer binding sites on each DNA, the results obtained with the two enzymes were compared using a variety of criteria. Both enzymes displayed sequence specificity in their preferred cleavage sites, although the nature of this selectivity was distinct for the two enzymes. In addition, nucleosomes produced by CAD nuclease are 8-10 bp longer than those produced with MNase, with the CAD cleavage sites tending to be 4-5 bp further out from the nucleosomal dyad than the corresponding MNase cleavage sites. Despite these notable differences in cleavage behaviour, the two nucleases identified essentially equivalent patterns of nucleosome positioning sites on each of the DNAs tested, an observation that was independent of the histone type. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22559821": " The organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin has a strong influence on the accessibility and regulation of genetic information. The locations and occupancies of a principle component of chromatin, nucleosomes, are typically assayed through use of enzymatic digestion with micrococcal nuclease (MNase). MNase is an endo-exo nuclease that preferentially digests naked DNA and the DNA in linkers between nucleosomes, thus enriching for nucleosome-associated DNA. To determine nucleosome organization genome-wide, DNA remaining from MNase digestion is sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies (MNase-seq). Unfortunately, the results of MNase-seq can vary dramatically due to technical differences and this confounds comparisons between MNase-seq experiments, such as examining condition-dependent chromatin organizations. In this study we use MNase digestion simulations to demonstrate how MNase-seq signals can vary for different nucleosome configuration when experiments are performed with different extents of MNase digestion. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. The presence of this neighborhood effect ultimately confounds comparisons between different MNase-seq experiments. To address this issue we present a standardized chromatin preparation which controls for technical variance between MNase-based chromatin preparations and enables the collection of similarly sampled (matched) chromatin populations. Standardized preparation of chromatin includes a normalization step for DNA input into MNase digestions and close matching of the extent of digestion between each chromatin preparation using gel densitometry analysis. The protocol also includes directions for successful pairing with multiplex sequencing reactions. We validated our method by comparing the experiment-to-experiment variation between biological replicates of chromatin preparations from S. cerevisiae. Results from our matched preparation consistently produced MNase-seq datasets that were more closely correlated than other unstandardized approaches. Additionally, we validated the ability of our approach at enabling accurate downstream comparisons of chromatin structures, by comparing the specificity of detecting Tup1-dependent chromatin remodeling events in comparisons between matched and un-matched wild-type and tup1\u0394 MNase-seq datasets. Our matched MNase-seq datasets demonstrated a significant reduction in non-specific (technical) differences between experiments and were able to maximize the detection of biologically-relevant (Tup1-dependent) changes in chromatin structure.",

This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning.

Our experiments produced nucleosomal DNA sizes varying between 147 and 155 bp, with positions of the MNase cuts reflecting positions of the A\u22c5T pairs rather than the nucleosome core/linker junctions determined by X-ray crystallography. Extent of chromatosomal DNA protection by linker histone H1 also depends on the linker DNA sequence. Remarkably, we found that a combined treatment with MNase and exonuclease III (exoIII) overcomes MNase sequence preference producing nucleosomal DNA trimmed symmetrically and precisely at the core/linker junctions regardless of the underlying DNA sequence. We propose that combined MNase/exoIII digestion can be applied to in situ chromatin for unbiased genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions that is not influenced by DNA sequences at the core/linker junctions. The same approach can be also used for the precise mapping of the extent of linker DNA protection by H1 and other protein factors associated with nucleosome linkers.",

Although MNase HS regions map to less than 1% of the genome, they consistently explain a remarkably large amount (\u223c40%) of heritable phenotypic variance in diverse complex traits. MNase HS regions are therefore on par with coding sequences as annotations that demarcate the functional parts of the maize genome.

Consistent with experimental evidence, the zinc ion is essential for mechanical stabilization of the functional, folded conformation. Hydrogen bond motifs are unique for deprotonated configurations yet overlap in protonated cases. Correlated motions and principal component analysis corroborate the similarity of the protonated configurations and highlight unique relationships of the zinc-bound configuration. We hypothesize a potential mechanism for zinc binding from results of the thiol configurations. The deprotonated, zinc-bound configuration alone predominantly maintains its tertiary structure throughout all 5 \u03bcs and alludes rare conformations potentially important for (im)proper zinc-finger-related protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions.",

Notably, NEMO was not recruited into the TNFR1 complex of DM cells, and consequently NF-\u03baB induction by TNF was severely impaired and DM cells were sensitized to TNF-induced cell death. Interestingly, the TNF signaling defects can be fully rescued by reconstitution of DM cells with CYLD lacking ubiquitin hydrolase activity but not with CYLD mutated in TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) or NEMO binding sites.

NEMO function is mediated by two distal ubiquitin binding domains located in the regulatory C-terminal domain of the protein: the coiled-coil 2-leucine zipper (CC2-LZ) domain and the zinc finger (ZF) domain. Here, we investigated the effect of the D406V mutation found in the NEMO ZF of an ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency patients. This point mutation does not impair the folding of NEMO ZF or mono-ubiquitin binding but is sufficient to alter NEMO function, as NEMO-deficient fibroblasts and Jurkat T lymphocytes reconstituted with full-length D406V NEMO lead to partial and strong defects in NF-\u03baB activation, respectively. To further characterize the ubiquitin binding properties of NEMO ZF, we employed di-ubiquitin (di-Ub) chains composed of several different linkages (Lys-48, Lys-63, and linear (Met-1-linked)). We showed that the pathogenic mutation preferentially impairs the interaction with Lys-63 and Met-1-linked di-Ub, which correlates with its ubiquitin binding defect in vivo. Furthermore, sedimentation velocity and gel filtration showed that NEMO ZF, like other NEMO related-ZFs, binds mono-Ub and di-Ub with distinct stoichiometries, indicating the presence of a new Ub site within the NEMO ZF. Extensive mutagenesis was then performed on NEMO ZF and characterization of mutants allowed the proposal of a structural model of NEMO ZF in interaction with a Lys-63 di-Ub chain.",

However, it has remained enigmatic whether NEMO binding to Lys-63-linked or linear ubiquitin chains is critical for triggering IKK activation. We show here that the NEMO C terminus, comprising the ubiquitin binding region and a zinc finger, has a high preference for binding to linear ubiquitin chains. However, immobilization of NEMO, which may be reminiscent of cellular oligomerization, facilitates the interaction with Lys-63 ubiquitin chains. Moreover, selective mutations in NEMO that abolish association with linear ubiquitin but do not affect binding to Lys-63 ubiquitin are only partially compromising NF-\u03baB signaling in response to TNF\u03b1 stimulation in fibroblasts and T cells. In line with this, TNF\u03b1-triggered expression of NF-\u03baB target genes and induction of apoptosis was partially compromised by NEMO mutations that selectively impair the binding to linear ubiquitin chains.

To determine potential mechanisms making nucleosomes transparent to transcription in vivo, we analyzed the nature of the nucleosome-induced arrest. We found that the arrests have been detected mostly at positions of strong intrinsic pause sites of DNA. The transient pausing makes pol II vulnerable to arrest, which involves backtracking of the elongation complex for a considerable distance on DNA. The histone-DNA contacts reestablished in front of pol II stabilize backtracked conformation of the polymerase. In agreement with this mechanism, blocking of backtracking prevents nucleosome-induced arrest.

The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT. Barrier properties are therefore dictated by both the local nucleosome structure (influenced by the strength of the histone-DNA interactions) and the location of the high-affinity DNA region within the nucleosome. Pol II transcribes DNA sequences at the entry into the tetramer much less efficiently than the same sequences located distal to the nucleosome dyad.

The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). As examples of the applicability of this system for mechanistic analyses of these and other factors, representative experiments show (i) that activated transcription from chromatin templates is concomitantly dependent on the activator, p300-mediated histone acetylation and elongation factor SII/TFIIS. (ii) that SII/TFIIS acts in a highly synergistic manner with p300 (and histone acetylation) at a step subsequent to preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and (iii) that SII/TFIIS works directly at the elongation step of chromatin transcription. Here we describe purification methods for the different factors employed and the specific transcriptional assays that led to the above-mentioned conclusions.

We also studied the effect of TFIIF and TFIIS on transcription of nucleosomes containing a Sin mutant histone. The Sin point mutations reduce critical histone-DNA contacts near the center of the nucleosome. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present.

The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Two distinct domains of human TFIIS, which bind RNAPII and nucleic acids, regulate read-through and possibly nascent transcript cleavage. Here we describe the three-dimensional NMR structure of a Cys4 nucleic-acid-binding domain from human TFIIS. Unlike previously characterized zinc modules, which contain an alpha-helix, this structure consists of a three-stranded beta-sheet. Analogous Cys4 structural motifs may occur in other proteins involved in DNA or RNA transactions, including RNAPII itself. This new structure, designated the Zn ribbon, extends the repertoire of Zn-mediated peptide architectures and highlights the growing recognition of the beta-sheet as a motif of nucleic-acid recognition.",

The present study used molecular docking by Autodock4.2 using our \"Click-By-Click\"-protocol, Ligplot1.4.3 and \"change in accessible surface area (\u0394ASA)-calculations\" to investigate the binding of two investigational anti-diabetic drugs, Ertugliflozin and Sotagliflozin to an established target (SGLT2) and a research target (human brain AChE). Sotagliflozin appeared more promising for SGLT2 as well as AChE-inhibition with reference to \u0394G and Ki values in comparison to Ertugliflozin. The \u0394G and Ki values for \"Sotagliflozin:AChE-binding\" were -7.16 kcal/mol and 5.6 \u03bcM, respectively while the same were found to be -8.47 kcal/mol and 0.62 \u03bcM, respectively for its interaction with SGLT2. Furthermore, \"Sotagliflozin:SGLT2-interaction\" was subjected to (un)binding simulation analyses by \"Molecular-Motion-Algorithms.\" This information is significant as the exact binding mode, interacting amino acid residues and simulation results for the said interaction have not been described yet. Also no X-ray crystal is available for the same. Finally, the results described herein indicate that Sotagliflozin could have an edge over Ertugliflozin for treatment of Type 2 diabetes.

Use of drugs in this class has increased because of their effect of decreasing body weight and a low risk for hypoglycemia, in addition to a relatively strong glucose-lowering effect. SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin and sotagliflozin (a SGLT1/SGLT2 dual inhibitor) also have a mild or moderate intestinal and renal SGLT1 inhibitory effect because of their relatively weak selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. Recent evidence shows that these SGLT2 inhibitors with low SGLT2/SGLT1 selectivity elevate the level of circulating glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that promotes insulin secretion in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. This effect probably occurs partly via inhibition of intestinal SGLT1, and the elevation of active GLP-1 levels is especially apparent when these drugs are co-administered with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. These findings suggest that a combination of canagliflozin or sotagliflozin and a DPP4 inhibitor can provide a beneficial effect associated with elevation of circulating active GLP-1 and may serve as a treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes.",

In this phase 3, double-blind trial, which was conducted at 133 centers worldwide, we randomly assigned 1402 patients with type 1 diabetes who were receiving treatment with any insulin therapy (pump or injections) to receive sotagliflozin (400 mg per day) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was a glycated hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% at week 24, with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis after randomization. Secondary end points included the change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin level, weight, systolic blood pressure, and mean daily bolus dose of insulin. A significantly larger proportion of patients in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group achieved the primary end point (200 of 699 patients [28.6%] vs. 107 of 703 [15.2%], P&lt;0.001). The least-squares mean change from baseline was significantly greater in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group for glycated hemoglobin (difference, -0.46 percentage points), weight (-2.98 kg), systolic blood pressure (-3.5 mm Hg), and mean daily bolus dose of insulin (-2.8 units per day) (P\u22640.002 for all comparisons). The rate of severe hypoglycemia was similar in the sotagliflozin group and the placebo group (3.0% [21 patients] and 2.4% [17], respectively). The rate of documented hypoglycemia with a blood glucose level of 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) or below was significantly lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group.

The majority of patients with T1D do not meet glycated hemoglobin (A1C) goals established by major diabetes organizations. Hypoglycemia risks and a rising incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome featured in the T1D population limit optimal use of intensive insulin therapy. Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents may enable T1D patients to achieve target A1C levels using lower insulin doses, which may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. In pilot studies, the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide reduced blood glucose, weight, and insulin dose in patients with T1D. Phase 2 studies with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and the dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor sotagliflozin, which acts in the gut and the kidney, have demonstrated reductions in A1C, weight, and glucose variability without an increased incidence of hypoglycemia.

We examined the effect of sotagliflozin on glycemic control and rate of hypoglycemia measurements in T1D mice maintained on a low daily insulin dose, and compared these results to those from mice maintained in better glycemic control with a higher daily insulin dose alone. Nonobese diabetes-prone mice with cyclophosphamide-induced T1D were randomized to receive one of four daily treatments: 0.2 U insulin/vehicle, 0.05 U insulin/vehicle, 0.05 U insulin/2 mg/kg sotagliflozin or 0.05 U insulin/30 mg/kg sotagliflozin. Insulin was delivered subcutaneously by micro-osmotic pump; the day after pump implantation, mice received their first of 22 once-daily oral doses of sotagliflozin or vehicle. Glycemic control was monitored by measuring fed blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels. Blood glucose levels decreased rapidly and comparably in the 0.05 U insulin/sotagliflozin-treated groups and the 0.2 U insulin/vehicle group compared to the 0.05 U insulin/vehicle group, which had significantly higher levels than the other three groups from day 2 through day 23.

Importantly, the 0.2 U insulin/vehicle group had, out of 100 blood glucose measurements, 13 that were &lt;70 mg/dL compared to one of 290 for the other three groups combined. Sotagliflozin significantly improved glycemic control, without increasing the rate of hypoglycemia measurements, in diabetic mice maintained on a low insulin dose. This sotagliflozin-mediated improvement in glycemic control was comparable to that achieved by raising the insulin dose alone, but was not accompanied by the increased rate of hypoglycemia measurements observed with the higher insulin dose.",

SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of oral antidiabetic drugs, acting by increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). They offer the advantages of a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia, a decrease in body weight and blood pressure and an efficacy at all stages of type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Clinical trials were identified using the Clinicaltrial.gov database. By a potential additional mechanism of action on intestinal glucose absorption linked to SGLT1 inhibition, sotagliflozin differentiates from SGLT2 inhibitors by reducing postprandial glucose excursion and insulin secretion, as well as by increasing GLP-1 secretion. Despite a weaker effect on UGE than selective SGLT2 inhibitors, sotagliflozin is as effective as SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1C reduction, with a similar safety profile in short-term studies.

Tools specifically designed for metagenomes, specifically metaSPAdes, MEGAHIT, and IDBA-UD, were the most effective at assembling viromes. Read pre-processing, such as partitioning, had virtually no impact on assembly output, but may be useful when hardware is limited. Viral populations with 2-5 \u00d7 coverage typically assembled well, whereas lesser coverage led to fragmented assembly. Strain heterogeneity within populations hampered assembly, especially when strains were closely related (average nucleotide identity, or ANI \u226597%) and when the most abundant strain represented &lt;50% of the population. Viral community composition assessments based on read recruitment were generally accurate when the following thresholds for detection were applied: (i) \u226510 kb contig lengths to define populations, (ii) coverage defined from reads mapping at \u226590% identity, and (iii) \u226575% of contig length with \u22651 \u00d7 coverage. Finally, although data are limited to the most abundant viruses in a community, alpha and beta diversity patterns were robustly estimated (\u00b110%) when comparing samples of similar sequencing depth, but more divergent (up to 80%) when sequencing depth was uneven across the dataset. In the latter cases, the use of normalization methods specifically developed for metagenomes provided the best estimates.

Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription silencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in vitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in RUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin configurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is methylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically methylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures comprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG island promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that aberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to tumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer epigenetics.",

The ChIP results indicate that H2A.Z is deposited at promoter regions by the Snf2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) complex following DNA demethylation. According to our genome-wide expression and DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. In contrast, SRCAP-mediated H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of constitutively expressed genes. By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe-seq assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes. Our data highlight H2A.Z as a novel and essential factor involved in 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced gene reactivation.

Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq). We find that the genomic location of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) is mostly cell type specific and preferentially found at enhancers in normal cells. In cancer cells, however, we observe a global reconfiguration of NDRs at distal regulatory elements coupled with a substantial reorganization of the cancer methylome. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Remarkably, we show that nucleosomes remain strongly organized and phased at many facultative distal regulatory elements, even in the absence of a NDR as an anchor. Finally, we find that key transcription factor (TF) binding sites also show extensive peripheral nucleosome phasing, suggesting the potential for TFs to organize NDRs genome-wide and contribute to deregulation of cancer epigenomes.

To better understand the role of nucleosomes in splicing, we used MLH1 splice site mutations in Lynch syndrome cases as a model to investigate if abnormal splicing was associated with altered nucleosome positioning at exon-intron boundaries. Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients. These mutations were previously shown to cause exon skipping in five of the six patients. Allele-specific high-resolution nucleosome mapping across exons and exon-intron boundaries revealed high levels of nucleosomes across all regions examined. Alleles containing donor or acceptor splice site mutations showed no consistent alteration in nucleosome positioning or occupancy. Nucleosomes were enriched at MLH1 exons in LCLs derived from Lynch syndrome patients, and in this model system the positioning of nucleosomes was unaltered at exon-intron boundaries containing splice site mutations.

DNA methylation abolished this phasing primarily at enhancers and CpG island (CGI) promoters, with little effect on insulators and non-CGI promoters.

Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. Therefore, there is a great demand in developing computational methods to identify chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods. CAME is implemented in java and the program is freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/. jechoi@gru.edu or khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr.

Here I adapted <i>N</i>ucleosome <i>O</i>ccupancy and <i>Me</i>thylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of CTCF binding events and to estimate the average nucleosome phasing distances in single cells. scNOMe-seq is therefore well-suited to characterize the chromatin organization of single cells in heterogeneous cellular mixtures.",

However, the debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA, while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. The results demonstrated that increasing methylated CpG density is correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions. Features with elevated methylated CpG density such as exons, SINE-Alu sequences, H3K36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated CpG islands are among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated CpG islands and unmethylated transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, outside of CpG islands, the density of CpGs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of DNA methylation with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. Thus, the relationship between DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy is influenced by the density of methylated CpG dinucleotides and by other epigenomic components in chromatin.",

The long duration of chemotherapy and the large pool of latently infected people represent challenges in disease control. To develop drugs that effectively eradicate latent infection and shorten treatment duration, the pathophysiology of the causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis needs to be understood. The discovery that the tubercle bacillus can develop a drug-tolerant dormant form and the identification of the underlying genetic program 10 years ago paved the way for a deeper understanding of the life of the parasite inside human lesions and for new approaches to antimycobacterial drug discovery. Here, we summarize what we have learnt since the discovery of the master regulator of dormancy, DosR, and the key gaps in our knowledge that remain. Furthermore, we discuss a possible wider clinical relevance of DosR for 'nontuberculous mycobacteria'.",

A soluble factor, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (D4GDI), produced by apoptotic CD4(+)CD25(+) (85% Foxp3(+)) cells is responsible for this inhibition of M. tb growth in human macrophages and in mice. M. tb-expanded CD4(+C)D25(+)Foxp3(+)D4GDI(+) cells do not produce IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. D4GDI inhibited growth of M. tb in MDMs by enhancing production of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and ROS, and by increasing apoptosis of M. tb-infected MDMs. D4GDI was concentrated at the site of disease in tuberculosis patients, with higher levels detected in pleural fluid than in serum. However, in response to M. tb, PBMC from tuberculosis patients produced less D4GDI than PBMC from persons with LTBI. M. tb-expanded CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3(+)) cells and D4GDI induced intracellular M. tb to express the dormancy survival regulator DosR and DosR-dependent genes, suggesting that D4GDI induces a non-replicating state in the pathogen.

It remains unclear whether expression of NRP genes occurs within the tissue of Mycobacterium bovis naturally infected cattle. In order to start dissecting this question, total RNA from bovine lymph node tissues of sacrificed tuberculin reacting animals was isolated and transcription of genes required for in vivo duplication (esxB and fbpB) and in vitro NRP (hspX, pfkB, and mb2660c) were analyzed by RT-PCR approaches. Detection of transcripts was positive in bovine tissue samples for genes hspX, pfkB, and mb2660c in 84, 32, and 21%, respectively.

The non-replicating or dormancy like state of this pathogen which is impervious to anti-tuberculosis drugs is widely recognized as the culprit for this scenario. The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence. The DosR regulon is regulated by a two-component regulatory system consisting of two sensor kinases-DosS (Rv3132c) and DosT (Rv2027c), and a response regulator DosR (Rv3133c). The underlying regulatory mechanism of DosR regulon expression is very complex. Many factors are involved, particularly the oxygen tension. The DosR regulon enables the pathogen to persist during lengthy hypoxia. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that the DosR regulon is widely distributed among the mycobacterial genomes, ranging from the pathogenic strains to the environmental strains. In-depth studies on the DosR response should provide insights into its role in TB latency in vivo and shape new measures to combat this exceeding recalcitrant pathogen.",

The dormancy survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein), which is associated with the ribosome under hypoxic conditions. A \u03943935 mutant phenocopies the \u0394dosR mutant during hypoxia, and complementation of \u0394dosR with the MSMEG_3935 gene leads to complete recovery of dosR mutant phenotypes during hypoxia. We suggest that this protein is named ribosome-associated factor under hypoxia (RafH) and that it is the major factor responsible for DosR-mediated hypoxic survival in mycobacteria.",

The regulation of M. tuberculosis metabolism during latent infection is not clearly known. The dormancy survival regulon (DosR regulon) is chiefly responsible for encoding dormancy related functions of M. tuberculosis. We describe functional characterization of an important gene of DosR regulon, Rv0079, which appears to be involved in the regulation of translation through the interaction of its product with bacterial ribosomal subunits. The protein encoded by Rv0079, possibly, has an inhibitory role with respect to protein synthesis, as revealed by our experiments. We performed computational modelling and docking simulation studies involving the protein encoded by Rv0079 followed by in vitro translation and growth curve analysis experiments, involving recombinant E. coli and Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) strains that overexpressed Rv0079. Our observations concerning the interaction of the protein with the ribosomes are supportive of its role in regulation/inhibition of translation. We propose that the protein encoded by locus Rv0079 is a 'dormancy associated translation inhibitor' or DATIN.",

We present a novel in vivo model of tuberculosis involving the encapsulation of bacilli in semidiffusible hollow fibers that are implanted subcutaneously into mice. Granulomatous lesions develop around these hollow fibers, and in this microenvironment, the organisms demonstrate an altered physiologic state characterized by stationary-state colony-forming unit counts and decreased metabolic activity. Moreover, these organisms show an antimicrobial susceptibility pattern similar to persistent bacilli in current models of tuberculosis chemotherapy in that they are more susceptible to the sterilizing drug, rifampin, than to the bactericidal drug isoniazid. We used this model of extracellular persistence within host granulomas to study both gene expression patterns and mutant survival patterns. Our results demonstrate induction of dosR (Rv3133c) and 20 other members of the DosR regulon believed to mediate the transition into dormancy, and that rel(Mtb) is required for Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival during extracellular persistence within host granulomas. Interestingly, the dormancy phenotype of extracellular M. tuberculosis within host granulomas appears to be immune mediated and interferon-gamma dependent.",

The individual and collective roles of these sensors have been postulated biochemically, but their roles in vivo have remained unclear. This work demonstrates distinct and additive roles for each sensor during anaerobic dormancy. Both sensors are necessary for wild-type levels of DosR regulon induction, and concomitantly, full induction of the regulon is required for wild-type anaerobic survival. In the anaerobic model, DosT plays an early role, responding to hypoxia. DosT then induces the regulon and with it DosS, which sustains and further induces the regulon. DosT then loses its functionality as oxygen becomes limited, and DosS alone maintains induction of the genes from that point forward. Thus, M. tuberculosis has evolved a system whereby it responds to hypoxic conditions in a stepwise fashion as it enters an anaerobic state.",

The M. tuberculosis DosR regulon is a genetic program induced by conditions that inhibit aerobic respiration and prevent bacillus replication. In this study, we used a mutant incapable of DosR regulon induction to investigate the contribution of this regulon to bacterial metabolism during anaerobic dormancy. Our results confirm that the DosR regulon is essential for M. tuberculosis survival during anaerobic dormancy and demonstrate that it is required for metabolic processes that occur upon entry into and throughout the dormant state. Specifically, we showed that regulon mechanisms shift metabolism away from aerobic respiration in the face of dwindling oxygen availability and are required for maintaining energy levels and redox balance as the culture becomes anaerobic. We also demonstrated that the DosR regulon is crucial for rapid resumption of growth once M. tuberculosis exits an anaerobic or nitric oxide-induced nonrespiring state. In summary, the DosR regulon encodes novel metabolic mechanisms essential for M. tuberculosis to survive in the absence of respiration and to successfully transition rapidly between respiring and nonrespiring conditions without loss of viability.",

We performed bioinformatic analyses which indicated that the pma1 gene product is the M. smegmatis ortholog of the M. tuberculosis cation transporter CtpF. In addition, a possible Na(+), K(+) and/or Ca(2+) pumping mediated by Pma1 was also predicted. Enzymatic analyses indicated that the basal ATPase activity of plasma membrane vesicles from M. smegmatis cells cultured under hypoxia and over-expressing DosR, decreased 30 and 40 % respectively in comparison to oxygenated cells. In contrast, the specific Na(+)/K(+) and Ca(2+) ATPase activities of the plasma membrane increased 2.8- and 3.5-fold, respectively, under hypoxia, similar to that observed for cells over-expressing the DosR regulator. In agreement, RT-qPCR experiments demonstrated that the transcription level of the pma1 gene increased under hypoxia at levels similar to that of M. smegmatis cells over-expressing the M. tuberculosis DosR regulator. The entire findings suggest that hypoxia stimulates Na(+)/K(+) and Ca(2+) ATPase activities in the mycobacterial plasma membrane, and this is possibly mediated by the dormancy regulator DosR.",

The failure of BCG in prevention/protection against latent forms of Mtb calls for efforts to curb latent Mtb infection. The inclusion of latency/dormancy antigens in the classical antigen preparation is surmised as a strategy. DosR (Dormancy Survival Regulator, Rv3133c) regulon genes are expressed under the conditions of latency/dormancy.

Dormant bacilli maintain viability for extended periods. Furthermore, they are resistant to antimycobacterials, and hence, dormancy might play a role in the persistence of tuberculosis infection despite prolonged chemotherapy. Previously, we have grown dormant Mycobacterium bovis BCG in an oxygen-limited Wayne culture system and subjected the bacilli to proteome analysis. This work revealed the upregulation of the response regulator Rv3133c and three other polypeptides (alpha-crystallin and two \"conserved hypothetical\" proteins) upon entry into dormancy. Here, we replaced the coding sequence of the response regulator with a kanamycin resistance cassette and demonstrated that the loss-of-function mutant died after oxygen starvation-induced termination of growth. Thus, the disruption of this dormancy-induced transcription factor resulted in loss of the ability of BCG to adapt to survival of hypoxia. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein extracts from the gene-disrupted strain showed that the genetic loss of the response regulator caused loss of the induction of the other three dormancy proteins. Thus, the upregulation of these dormancy proteins requires the response regulator. Based on these two functions, dormancy survival and regulation, we named the Rv3133c gene dosR for dormancy survival regulator. Our results provide conclusive evidence that DosR is a key regulator in the oxygen starvation-induced mycobacterial dormancy response.",

To elucidate the function of tdd8, the transcriptomes of S. coelicolor strain M145 and of a tdd8 deletion mutant derivative (the \u0394tdd8 strain) were compared. Several orthologs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes involved in dormancy survival were upregulated in the deletion mutant at the visual onset of prodiginine production. These genes are organized in a putative redox stress response cluster comprising two large loci. A binding motif similar to the dormancy survival regulator (DosR) binding site of M. tuberculosis has been identified in the upstream sequences of most genes in these loci. A predicted role for these genes in the redox stress response is supported by the low NAD(+)/NADH ratio in the \u0394tdd8 strain. This S. coelicolor gene cluster was shown to be induced by hypoxia and NO stress. While the tdd8 deletion mutant (the \u0394tdd8 strain) was unable to maintain calcium homeostasis in a calcium-depleted medium, the addition of Ca(2+) in \u0394tdd8 culture medium reduced the expression of several genes of the redox stress response cluster.

The proteins encoded by the dormancy survival regulon (DosR regulon) are mainly responsible for survival of the bacilli in a latent form. To maintain latency, mycobacteria orchestrate a balanced interplay of different cytokines secreted by immune cells during the granulomatous stage. The function of most of the DosR regulon proteins of M. tuberculosis is unknown. In this study, we have shown that one of the DosR regulon proteins, DATIN, encoded by the gene Rv0079, can stimulate macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to secrete important cytokines that may be significant in granuloma formation and its maintenance. The expression level of DATIN in Mycobacterium bovis BCG was found to be upregulated in pH stress and microaerobic conditions. Computational modeling, docking and simulation study suggested that DATIN might interact with TLR2. This was further confirmed through the interaction of recombinant DATIN with TLR2 expressed by HEK293 cells. When in vitro differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with recombinant DATIN, increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 was observed in a dose dependent manner. When differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with a modified BCG strain that overexpressed DATIN, augmented secretions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 were observed as compared to a reference BCG strain containing empty vector. Similarly, human PBMCs when infected with M. bovis BCG that overexpressed DATIN, upregulated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8.

In this study, data from genetic epidemiologic and biochemical studies are reviewed. The increase in the daily exposure dose to acetaldehyde in alcohol-consuming ALDH2-deficients vs. ALDH2-actives was about twofold.

Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) protects cardiac function from myocardial damage. Therefore, understanding of its roles in diabetic heart is critical for developing new therapeutics targeting ALDH2 and mitochondrial function for diabetic hearts. This study investigated the impact of ALDH2 deficiency on diastolic function and energy metabolism in diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced in ALDH2 knockout and wild-type mice by streptozotocin. Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography. Glucose uptake, energy status, and metabolic profiles were used to evaluate cardiac energy metabolism. The association between ALDH2 polymorphism and diabetes was also analyzed in patients. Echocardiography revealed preserved systolic function and impaired diastolic function in diabetic ALDH2-deficient mice. Energy reserves (phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio) were reduced in the diabetic mutants and were associated with diastolic dysfunction. Western blot analysis showed that diabetes induces accumulated lipid peroxidation products and escalated AMP-activated protein kinase-LKB1 pathway. Further, ALDH2 deficiency exacerbated the diabetes-induced deficient myocardial glucose uptake and other perturbations of metabolic profiles. Finally, ALDH2 mutations were associated with worse diastolic dysfunction in diabetic patients. Together, our results demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency and resulting energy metabolism disturbance is a part of pathology of diastolic dysfunction of diabetic hearts, and suggest that patients with ALDH2 mutations are vulnerable to diabetic damage. ALDH2 deficiency exacerbates diastolic dysfunction in early diabetic hearts. ALDH2 deficiency triggers decompensation of metabolic reserves and energy metabolism disturbances in early diabetic hearts. ALDH2 deficiency potentiates oxidative stress and AMPK phosphorylation induced by diabetes via post-translational regulation of LKB1. Diabetic patients with ALDH2 mutations are predisposed to worse diastolic dysfunction.",

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), a major ACH eliminating enzyme, is genetically deficient in 30-50% of Eastern Asians. In alcohol drinkers, ALDH2-deficiency is a well-known risk factor for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, i.e., head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer. However, there is only a limited evidence for stomach cancer. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that ALDH2 deficiency results in markedly increased exposure of the gastric mucosa to acetaldehyde after intragastric administration of alcohol. Our finding provides concrete evidence for a causal relationship between acetaldehyde and gastric carcinogenesis. A plausible explanation is the gastric first pass metabolism of ethanol. The gastric mucosa expresses alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, especially at the high ethanol concentrations prevailing in the stomach after the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The gastric mucosa also possesses the acetaldehyde-eliminating ALDH2 enzyme. Due to decreased mucosal ALDH2 activity, the elimination of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde is decreased, which results in its accumulation in the gastric juice. We also demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, and L-cysteine cause independent changes in gastric juice and salivary acetaldehyde levels, indicating that intragastric acetaldehyde is locally regulated by gastric mucosal ADH and ALDH2 enzymes, and by oral microbes colonizing an achlorhydric stomach. Markedly elevated acetaldehyde levels were also found at low intragastric ethanol concentrations corresponding to the ethanol levels of many foodstuffs, beverages, and dairy products produced by fermentation. A capsule that slowly releases L-cysteine effectively eliminated acetaldehyde from the gastric juice of PPI-treated ALDH2-active and ALDH2-deficient subjects. These results provide entirely novel perspectives for the prevention of gastric cancer, especially in established risk groups.",

We evaluated the effect of ALDH2 deficiency on EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions, gut barrier dysfunction, and liver injury. Wild-type and ALDH2-deficient mice were fed EtOH (1 to 6%) in Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks. Gut permeability in vivo was measured by plasma-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, tight junction and adherens junction integrity was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and liver injury was assessed by the analysis of plasma transaminase activity, histopathology, and liver triglyceride. EtOH feeding elevated colonic mucosal acetaldehyde, which was significantly greater in ALDH2-deficient mice. ALDH2(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in the EtOH diet intake. Therefore, this study was continued only in wild-type and ALDH2(+/-) mice. EtOH feeding elevated mucosal inulin permeability in distal colon, but not in proximal colon, ileum, or jejunum of wild-type mice. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, EtOH-induced inulin permeability in distal colon was not only higher than that in wild-type mice, but inulin permeability was also elevated in the proximal colon, ileum, and jejunum. Greater inulin permeability in distal colon of ALDH2(+/-) mice was associated with a more severe redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the intercellular junctions. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, EtOH feeding caused a loss of junctional distribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in the ileum.

These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions, barrier dysfunction, and liver damage.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8107218": "We have found that transcription of the pregenome of an avian hepadnavirus, duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), is dependent on the presence of a small element in the 5' transcribed region of the pregenome-encoding sequence. This element, which we have named pet (positive effector of transcription), exerts its effect in cis in a position and orientation-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as part of the nascent pregenome transcript. The requirement for pet depends on the presence in the transcription unit of a region of the DHBV genome located upstream of the envelope promoters, which specifically suppresses transcription of templates lacking pet. In the presence of this region, deletion of pet activates transcription from downstream promoters, suggesting that pregenome transcription complexes fail to reach the downstream promoters. In vitro transcription experiments support the model that pet is required for transcription elongation on the DHBV template. We speculate that pet is required to suppress transcription termination during the first passage of pregenome transcription complexes through a viral termination region on the circular viral DNA.",

These regions were previously identified by using plasmid clones of the virus in transient expression assays (M. Huang and J. Summers, J. Virol. 68:1564-1572, 1994). In this study, we further analyzed these regions by using in vitro-synthesized circular DHBV DNA monomers to mimic the authentic transcriptional template. We observed that pet was required for pregenome transcription from circular viral monomers, and in the absence of pet-dependent transcription, expression of the viral envelope genes was increased. We found that deletion of net in circularized DNA monomers led to the production of abnormally long transcripts due to a failure to form 3' ends during transcription. In addition, we report the presence of a net-like region in the mammalian hepadnavirus woodchuck hepatitis virus. These results are consistent with a model that net is a region involved in transcription termination and that in DHBV, pet is required for transcription complexes to read through this region during the first pass through net.",

Here, we show that, in non-dividing hepatic cells, H4K20Me1 is specifically enriched in active gene bodies and dynamically regulated by the antagonistic action of Kmt5a methylase and Kdm7b demethylase. In liver-specific Kmt5a-deficient mice, reduced levels of H4K20Me<sub>1</sub> correlated with reduced RNA Pol II release from promoter-proximal regions. Genes regulating glucose and fatty acid metabolism were most sensitive to impairment of RNA Pol II release. Downregulation of glycolytic genes resulted in an energy starvation condition partially compensated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and increased mitochondrial activity. This metabolic reprogramming generated a highly sensitized state that, upon different metabolic stress conditions, quickly aggravated into a senescent phenotype due to ROS overproduction-mediated oxidative DNA damage. The results illustrate how defects in the general process of RNA Pol II transition into a productive elongation phase can trigger specific metabolic changes and genome instability.",

Therefore, one approach insurers can use is an age cutoff for covering the cost of topical tretinoin therapy. Our purpose was to determine at what age patients are more likely to receive tretinoin for treatment of acne vulgaris versus other conditions to provide a rational basis for insurers to set coverage cutoffs. National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data for the years 1990 to 1994 were analyzed to ascertain the age distribution of acne vulgaris office visits and treatment with topical acne agents including tretinoin.

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of topical use of tretinoin or isotretinoin on hairless mice epidermis, using appropriate histopathological and histometric techniques, in order to evaluate the influence of isomerism on skin effects. For this, gel cream formulations containing or not 0.05% tretinoin or 0.05% isotretinoin were applied in the dorsum of hairless mice, once a day for seven days.

Our results showed that tretinoin and isotretinoin were effective in the enhancement of viable epidermis thickness and number of epidermal cell layers, suggesting that they could be used for stimulation of cellular renewal. However isomerism influenced skin effects since isotretinoin had more pronounced effects than tretinoin in viable epidermis.

Questions that remain are (1) whether irritation causes all or part of the improvement; (2) the concentration of tretinoin that maximizes clinical response with minimal side effects; and (3) the effects of long-term treatment on components of the cutaneous immune system. To address these issues, 99 photoaged patients completed a 48-week study using 0.1% tretinoin cream (n = 32), 0.025% tretinoin (n = 35), or vehicle (n = 32) once daily in a double-blind manner. Before and after treatment, we assessed histologic features, keratinocyte expression of HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, numbers of epidermal Langerhans' cells and epidermal and dermal T lymphocytes, and vascularity as measured by dermal endothelial cell area. Both 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin produced statistically significant overall improvement in photoaging of the face compared with vehicle; there were no clinically or statistically significant differences in efficacy between the two concentrations of tretinoin. After 48 weeks, 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin produced similar statistically significant epidermal thickening (by 30% and 28%, respectively) compared with vehicle (11% decrease) and increased vascularity (by 100% and 89%, respectively) compared with vehicle (9% decrease). By various analyses, irritant side effects (erythema and scaling) were statistically significantly greater with 0.1% tretinoin than with 0.025% tretinoin. No significant changes occurred in any immunologic markers when tretinoin and vehicle treatments were compared. Tretinoin 0.1% and 0.025% produce similar clinical and histologic changes in patients with photoaging, despite significantly greater incidence of irritation with the higher concentration.

Tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin. Tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms. It binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors, inducing changes in gene expression that leads to cell differentiation, decreased cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumourigenesis. It has been demonstrated that photoaging resulting from UV-B radiation can be treated by retinoid formulations. Pretreatment of human skin with tretinoin blocks dermal matrix degradation followed by sun exposure, inhibiting the induction of the activated protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor and AP-1 regulated matrix-degrading metalloproteinases. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE AND INTEREST: Tretinoin should be considered as a key factor as it is the most potent and best-studied retinoid. In addition, the development of advanced drug delivery systems, especially novel nanoformulations, has contributed to overpass some technical drawbacks besides the skin irritation potential. The triple combination of tretinoin, hydroquinone and corticosteroids is still considered the gold standard for melasma.

We show that E(spl)m\u03b3, E(spl)m\u03b2, E(spl)m8 and Deadpan (Dpn), members of the basic helix-loop-helix-Orange protein family, are expressed in NBs but not in differentiated cells. Double mutation for the E(spl) complex and dpn severely affects the ability of NBs to self-renew, causing premature termination of proliferation. Single mutations produce only minor defects, which points to functional redundancy between E(spl) proteins and Dpn. Expression of E(spl)m\u03b3 and m8, but not of dpn, depends on Notch signalling from the GMC/INP daughter to the NB. When Notch is abnormally activated in NB progeny cells, overproliferation defects are seen. We show that this depends on the abnormal induction of E(spl) genes. In fact E(spl) overexpression can partly mimic Notch-induced overproliferation. Therefore, E(spl) and Dpn act together to maintain the NB in a self-renewing state, a process in which they are assisted by Notch, which sustains expression of the E(spl) subset.",

However, because of the limited lineage markers available, these observations have been made only for the NB4-2 lineage. Recent findings have placed this transcription factor in the vanguard of Drosophila neural stem cell biology by demonstrating that Klu is necessary for larval neuroblast growth and self-renewal. Here, we have studied the role of klu in an incipient model in order to address basic mechanisms of neural specification: the Va system. None of the previously reported roles of Klu satisfactorily explain our observations. Unexpectedly, in this lineage, klu is necessary for differentiating between the fates of the two neurons born from a unique GMC; klu mutants produce two B-type cells, rather than one B-type (Notch-OFF) and one A-type (Notch-ON) cell. Additionally, our results demonstrate that Klu operates in the GMC and/or in the newly born neuron, but not in the neuroblast. Unlike in larval neuroblasts in which Klu is an executor of Notch signaling, we have found that Klu does not lie downstream of the Notch pathway in this cell division context.",

Type I neuroblasts produce ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that divide once to produce differentiated progeny, while type II neuroblasts produce self-renewing intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and thus generate lineages containing many more progeny. We identified Taranis (Tara) as an important determinant of type I lineage-specific neural progenitor proliferation patterns. Tara is an ortholog of mammalian SERTAD proteins that are known to regulate cell cycle progression. Tara is differentially-expressed in neural progenitors, with high levels of expression in proliferating type I neuroblasts but no detectable expression in type II lineage INPs. Tara is necessary for cell cycle reactivation in quiescent neuroblasts and for cell cycle progression in type I lineages. Cell cycle defects in tara mutant neuroblasts are due to decreased activation of the E2F1/Dp transcription factor complex and delayed progression through S-phase. Mis-expression of tara in type II lineages delays INP cell cycle progression and induces premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs. Premature INP differentiation can also be induced by loss of E2F1/Dp function and elevated E2F1/Dp expression suppresses Tara-induced INP differentiation. Our results show that lineage-specific Tara expression is necessary for proper brain development and suggest that distinct cell cycle regulatory mechanisms exist in type I versus type II neural progenitors.",

We identify the Posterior Asense-Negative (PAN) neuroblasts, which do not express the transcription factors Asense or Prospero. PAN neuroblasts rely on the segregating determinants Numb and Brat to generate smaller, secondary neuroblasts that in turn give rise to ganglion mother cells (GMCs) and neurons throughout larval development. In brat or numb mutants, misspecified secondary neuroblasts are unable to produce differentiated progeny and initiate tumor-like overgrowth. In prospero mutants, however, tumors arise from GMCs while secondary neuroblasts are correctly specified.

Understanding the generation of neuronal diversity requires not only elucidation of the molecules and mechanisms that specify NB identity but also those that act to differentiate between the cell types produced within one NB lineage. Here we show that the Drosophila Zn finger protein Klumpfuss (Klu), which shows sequence similarities to the mammalian Wilm's tumor suppressor (WT-1), acts to differentiate between the identities of the first two secondary precursor cells produced from one NB lineage. Klu is expressed in the NB4-2 lineage only after two rounds of NB cell division, in the second born GMC (GMC4-2b). In loss-of-function mutant embryos, the first born GMC (GMC4-2a) as well as its progeny neurons are duplicated; we show that this duplication of the GMC4-2a sublineage arises because GMC4-2b adopts the identity of GMC4-2a and divides to produce the GMC4-2a progeny. Moreover, when Klu is ectopically expressed in GMC4-2a, it fails to acquire its normal identity and fails to produce correctly specified progeny. klu therefore acts to specify the identity of GMC4-2b and to make it distinct from GMC4-2a. Our findings further suggest that the determination of GMC cell fate occurs in two steps; the initial GMC identity is the consequence of inheritance from the maternal NB, however, the subsequent stabilization of this identity requires functions like klu in the GMC.",

It is not known whether GMCs have the potential to undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. It is also not known how precursor cells undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. Here, we report that maintaining high levels of Mitimere or Nubbin, two POU proteins, in a GMC causes it to undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. These asymmetric divisions are due to upregulation of Cyclin E in late GMC and its unequal distribution between two daughter cells. GMCs in an embryo overexpressing Cyclin E, or in an embryo mutant for archipelago, also undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. Although the GMC self-renewal is independent of inscuteable and numb, the fate of the differentiating daughter is inscuteable and numb-dependent. Our results reveal that regulation of Cyclin E levels, and asymmetric distribution of Cyclin E and other determinants, confer self-renewing asymmetric division potential to precursor cells, and thus define a pathway that regulates such divisions. These results add to our understanding of maintenance and loss of pluripotential stem cell identity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15704126": "The generation of cellular diversity in the developing embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster requires the precise orchestration of several convergent molecular and cellular mechanisms. Most reviews have focused on the formation and specification of neuroblasts (NBs), the putative neural stem cell in the Drosophila central nervous system. NBs divide asymmetrically to regenerate themselves and produce a secondary precursor cell called a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which divides to produce neurons and glia. Historically, our understanding of GMC specification has arisen from work involving asymmetric localization of intrinsic factors in the NB and GMC. However, recent information on NB lineages has revealed additional intrinsic factors that specify general and specific GMC fates. This review addresses what has been revealed about these intrinsic cues with regard to GMC specification. For example, Prospero, an asymmetrically localized determinant, plays a general role to enable GMC development and to distinguish GMCs from NBs. In contrast, the temporal gene cascade functions within NB lineages to ensure that each GMC in a lineage acquires a different fate. Two different mechanisms used to make the progeny of GMCs different will also be discussed. One is a generic mechanism, regulated by Notch and Numb, that allows sibling cells to adopt different fates. The other mechanism involves genes, such as even-skipped and klumpfuss that specify the fate of individual GMCs. All of these mechanisms converge within a GMC to bestow upon it a unique fate.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8095484": "The Drosophila embryonic central nervous system (CNS) is derived from a stereotypic array of progenitor stem cells called neuroblasts (NBs). Each of the approximately 25 NBs per hemisegment undergoes repeated asymmetric divisions to produce, on average, 5-10 smaller ganglion mother cells (GMCs); each GMC, in turn, divides to produce two neurons. We demonstrate that the protein product encoded by a POU homeo domain gene (dPOU28/pdm-2) is expressed in the cell nuclei of a subset of NBs and GMCs. In the wild-type animal, GMC-1 is the only identified cell in the NB4-2 lineage that expresses dPOU28 protein to a high level, and it divides to produce the RP2 neuron and a second cell of unknown fate. Our results suggest that the presence of ectopically induced dPOU28/pdm-2 protein in the progeny of GMC-1 is sufficient to cause both of these cells to adopt their parental GMC-1 cell fate, leading to duplication of the RP2 neuron (and its sister cell) on the basis of both immunological and morphological criteria. These observations clearly implicate a role for dPOU28/pdm-2 in the specification of GMC-1 cell identity in the NB4-2 lineage and possibly in the specification of cell fate in other NB lineages in the developing embryonic CNS.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25285448": "Intermediate neural progenitor cells (INPs) need to avoid differentiation and cell cycle exit while maintaining restricted developmental potential, but mechanisms preventing differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs are not well understood. In this study, we report that the Drosophila homolog of mammalian Sp8 transcription factor Buttonhead (Btd) prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs in Drosophila larval type II neuroblast (NB) lineages. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. We provide evidence to demonstrate that Btd prevents the premature differentiation by suppressing the expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in immature INPs. We further show that Btd functions cooperatively with the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 to promote the generation of INPs. Thus, our work reveals a critical mechanism that prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of Drosophila INPs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9637687": "Asymmetric cell division is a widespread mechanism in developing tissues that leads to the generation of cell diversity. In the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, secondary precursor cells-ganglion mother cells (GMCs)-divide and produce postmitotic neurons that take on different cell fates. In this study, we show that binary fate decision of two pairs of sibling neurons is accomplished through the interplay of Notch (N) signaling and the intrinsic fate determinant Numb. We show that GMCs have apical-basal polarity and Numb localization and the orientation of division are coordinated to segregate Numb to only one sibling cell. The correct positioning of Numb and the proper orientation of division require Inscuteable (Insc). Loss of insc results in the generation of equivalent sibling cells. Our results provide evidence that sibling neuron fate decision is nonstochastic and normally depends on the presence of Numb in one of the two siblings. Moreover, our data suggest that the fate of some sibling neurons may be regulated by signals that do not require lateral interaction between the sibling cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11688564": "The bipotential Ganglion Mother Cells, or GMCs, in the Drosophila CNS asymmetrically divide to generate two distinct post-mitotic neurons. Here, we show that the midline repellent Slit (Sli), via its receptor Roundabout (Robo), promotes the terminal asymmetric division of GMCs. In GMC-1 of the RP2/sib lineage, Slit promotes asymmetric division by down regulating two POU proteins, Nubbin and Mitimere. The down regulation of these proteins allows the asymmetric localization of Inscuteable, leading to the asymmetric division of GMC-1. Consistent with this, over-expression of these POU genes in a late GMC-1 causes mis-localization of Insc and symmetric division of GMC-1 to generate two RP2s. Similarly, increasing the dosage of the two POU genes in sli mutant background enhances the penetrance of the RP2 lineage defects whereas reducing the dosage of the two genes reduces the penetrance of the phenotype. These results tie a cell-non-autonomous signaling pathway to the asymmetric division of precursor cells during neurogenesis.",

One mechanism by which noncoding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) influence downstream phenotypes is through the regulation of gene expression. Methods to predict whether or not individual SNVs are likely to regulate gene expression would aid interpretation of variants of unknown significance identified in whole-genome sequencing studies. We developed FIRE (Functional Inference of Regulators of Expression), a tool to score both noncoding and coding SNVs based on their potential to regulate the expression levels of nearby genes. FIRE consists of 23 random forests trained to recognize SNVs in cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) using a set of 92 genomic annotations as predictive features. FIRE scores discriminate cis-eQTL SNVs from non-eQTL SNVs in the training set with a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.807, and discriminate cis-eQTL SNVs shared across six populations of different ancestry from non-eQTL SNVs with an AUC of 0.939. FIRE scores are also predictive of cis-eQTL SNVs across a variety of tissue types.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914101": "Ultraconserved regions (UCRs) are non-protein coding gene sequences that are strictly conserved across among different species. Emerging evidence demonstrates that transcribed ultraconserved regions (TUCRs) encoding noncoding RNAs serve as regulators of gene expression. In recent decades, increasing evidence implicates the involvement of UCRs in carcinogenesis. The role of TUC.338 in cervical cancers was an oncogene in previous studies. Until now, the role of TUC.338 in colorectal cancers remains undefined. This study revealed that TUC.338 is significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancers (CRC) tissue and CRC cell lines, and the up-regulated TUC.338 is associated with lymph node metastasis. Transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly inhibited cell migration and invasion in SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines. TIMP-1 was demonstrated to be negatively regulated by TUC.338 at the posttranscriptional level, via a specific target site within the 3' untranslated region by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of TIMP-1 was also observed to inversely correlate with TUC.338 expression in CRC tissues. Over-expression of TIMP-1 with migRI-TIMP-1-GFP inhibited CRC cell migration and invasion and down-regulates MMP9, resembling that of TUC.338-siRNA. Thus, these findings suggested that TUC.338 acts as a novel oncogene by targeting the TIMP-1 gene thus promoting colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion.",

The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway is over-activated in many types of cancer and has been shown to be an important pathway in cancer stem cell-mediated propagation of cancer. Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells considered to be the primary source of tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to conventional therapies, and thus, responsible for cancer relapse. This review describes the clinical development program of this first-in-class cancer stemness inhibitor, including preclinical discovery, early clinical trials, current phase III clinical trial evaluation, and future therapeutic combinations. The therapeutic potential of napabucasin was first reported in a preclinical study that demonstrated the potent anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity of napabucasin in several different cancer types, both in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models, napabucasin was effective both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents; in particular, synergy was observed with paclitaxel in vivo. Napabucasin clinical trials have demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity as monotherapy and in combination with conventional therapeutics, with no significant pharmacokinetic interactions when used in combination therapies. Adverse events attributed to napabucasin have been predominantly mild, although some patients have experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse events. More severe adverse events required reduced or discontinued dosing of napabucasin or medication to reverse or manage symptoms. In conclusion, napabucasin may prove useful in targeting cancer stem cells, with the potential to suppress metastasis and prevent relapse in patients with varying cancer types.",

This study aimed to assess the feasibility of applying PDO in vitro culture for endocrine-based and drug sensitivity testing in endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer cells were enzymatically dissociated from tumors retrieved from fresh hysterectomy specimens and cultured within basement membrane extract in serum-free medium. An organoid growth assay was developed to assess the inhibitory effects of a variety of drugs including endocrine treatments. Organoid cultures were also prepared for histological and immunohistochemical comparison to the tumors of origin. Fifteen endometrial cancer specimens were successfully cultured as PDOs. Small spherical structures formed within 24 hours, and many continued to grow to larger, denser organoids, providing the basis for an organoid growth assay. The STAT3 transcription factor inhibitor, BBI608 (Napabucasin), strongly inhibited growth in almost all PDO cultures, suggesting that stemness programing is involved in organoid formation and/or growth. Inhibition by different growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors was observed in several PDO specimens. Four cultures were inhibited by fulvestrant, implying the importance of estrogen-receptor signaling in some PDO cultures. Organoids closely resembled their tumors of origin in both histomorphology and immunohistochemical expression. The use of endometrial cancer PDO cultures for development of drug sensitivity testing for individual patient tumors is feasible. The potential value of the PDO model for clinical decision making will require clinical trial evaluation.",

Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and dementia, is caused by dysregulation of methionine metabolism secondary to deficiency of the allosteric regulator, adenosyl methionine. Deficiency of adenosyl methionine results from increased polyamine biosynthesis by infected host cells, causing increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase, decreased nitric oxide and peroxynitrate formation and impaired immune reactions. The down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation that is observed in aging and dementia is attributed to deficiency of thioretinaco ozonide oxygen complexed with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and phosphate, which catalyzes oxidative phosphorylation. Adenosyl methionine biosynthesis is dependent upon thioretinaco ozonide and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the deficiency of adenosyl methionine and impaired immune function in aging are attributed to depletion of thioretinaco ozonide from mitochondrial membranes. Allyl sulfides and furanonaphthoquinones protect against oxidative stress and apoptosis by increasing the endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide and by inhibiting electron transfer to the active site of oxidative phosphorylation. Diallyl trisulfide and napabucasin inhibit the signaling by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), potentially enhancing immune function by effects on T helper lymphocytes and promotion of apoptosis. Homocysteine promotes endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis by the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress through activation of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, causing oxidative stress, calcium influx, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction. The prevention of atherosclerosis and dementia may be accomplished by a proposed nutritional metabolic homocysteine-lowering protocol which enhances immunity and corrects the altered oxidative metabolism in atherosclerosis and dementia.",

A small molecule, napabucasin (BBI608), recently have been identified with suppression of stemness-high cancer cells in a variety of cancers. However, the effects of napabucasin on PCa cells as well as PrCSCs isolated from PCa cells have not yet been defined. The effect of napabucasin on PCa cells in cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration in vitro were measured by MTS, colony formation assay, and Transwell, respectively. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cell cycle and cell apoptosis, and the effect on tumorigenesis in vivo was examined by tumor growth assays. Furthermore, the role of napabucasin on self-renewal and survival of PrCSCs was evaluated by their ability to grow spheres and cell viability assay, respectively. Western Blot and qRT-PCR were used to determine the effect of napabucasin on the expressions of stemness markers. Decrease in cell viability, colony formation, migration, and survival with cell cycle arrest, higher sensitivity to docetaxel in vitro, and repressed tumorigenesis in vivo was observed upon napabucasin treatment. More importantly, napabucasin can obviously inhibit spherogenesis and even kill PrCSCs in vitro. Downregulation of stemness markers was observed after PrCSCs were treated with napabucasin. This study demonstrates that napabucasin may be a novel approach in the treatment of advanced PCa, specifically for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20808889": "Eukaryotic centromeres are maintained at specific chromosomal sites over many generations. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeres are genetic elements defined by a DNA sequence that is both necessary and sufficient for function; whereas, in most other eukaryotes, centromeres are maintained by poorly characterized epigenetic mechanisms in which DNA has a less definitive role. Here we use the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans as a model organism to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. By determining the genome-wide replication timing program of the C. albicans genome, we discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. Importantly, epigenetic formation of new ectopic centromeres (neocentromeres) was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, such that a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components. Furthermore, changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions, further supporting the idea that centromere proteins determine origin activity. Finally, analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. This strand-biased pattern is conserved, together with centromere position, among related strains and species, in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence. Thus, inheritance of centromere position is correlated with a constitutively active origin of replication that fires at a distinct early time. We suggest a model in which the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15795314": "The budding yeast S phase checkpoint responds to hydroxyurea-induced nucleotide depletion by preventing replication fork collapse and the segregation of unreplicated chromosomes. Although the block to chromosome segregation has been thought to occur by inhibiting anaphase, we show checkpoint-defective rad53 mutants undergo cycles of spindle extension and collapse after hydroxyurea treatment that are distinct from anaphase cells. Furthermore, chromatid cohesion, whose dissolution triggers anaphase, is dispensable for S phase checkpoint arrest. Kinetochore-spindle attachments are required to prevent spindle extension during replication blocks, and chromosomes with two centromeres or an origin of replication juxtaposed to a centromere rescue the rad53 checkpoint defect. These observations suggest that checkpoint signaling is required to generate an inward force involved in maintaining preanaphase spindle integrity during DNA replication distress. We propose that by promoting replication fork integrity under these conditions Rad53 ensures centromere duplication. Replicating chromosomes can then bi-orient in a cohesin-independent manner to restrain untimely spindle extension.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10408447": "The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe normally has haploid cells of two mating types, which differ at the chromosomal locus mat1. After two consecutive asymmetric cell divisions, only one in four 'grand-daughter' cells undergoes a 'mating-type switch', in which genetic information is transferred to mat1 from the mat2-P or mat3-M donor loci. This switching pattern probably results from an imprinting event at mat1 that marks one sister chromatid in a strand-specific manner, and is related to a site-specific, double-stranded DNA break at mat1. Here we show that the genetic imprint is a strand-specific, alkali-labile DNA modification at mat1. The DNA break is an artefact, created from the imprint during DNA purification. We also propose and test the model that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s), so that the strand-specific imprint occurs only during lagging-strand synthesis. Altering the origin of replication, by inverting mat1 or introducing an origin of replication, affects the imprinting and switching efficiencies in predicted ways. Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s). Thus, the DNA replication machinery may confer different developmental potential to sister cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8458255": "We isolated mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lose a 100 kb linear yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) at elevated rates. Mutations in two of these LCS (linear chromosome stability) genes had little or no effect on the loss rate of a circular YAC that had the same centromere and origin of replication as present on the linear YAC. Moreover, mutations in these LCS genes also increased the loss rate of an authentic linear yeast chromosome, chromosome III, but had only small effects on the loss rate of a circular derivative of chromosome III. As these mutants preferentially destabilize linear chromosomes, they may affect chromosome stability through interactions at telomeres. Telomeres are thought to be essential for the protection and complete replication of chromosome ends. The cytological properties of telomeres suggest that these structures may play additional roles in chromosome function. The lengths of the terminal C1-3A repeats at the ends of yeast chromosomes were unaltered in the linear preferential lcs mutants, suggesting that these mutants do not affect the replication or protection of telomeric DNA. Thus, the linear-preferential lcs mutants may identify a role for telomeres in chromosome stability that is distinct from their function in the replication and protection of chromosomal termini.",

The identification of these structures allows the construction of artificial chromosomes in which the architecture of eukaryotic chromosomes may be studied. A common feature of most, and possibly all, natural yeast chromosomes is that they have an ARS within 2 kilobases of their physical ends. To study the effects of such telomeric ARSs on chromosome maintenance, we introduced artificial chromosomes of approximately 15 and 60 kilobases into yeast cells and analyzed the requirements for telomeric ARSs and the effects of ARS-free chromosomal arms on the stability of these molecules. We find that terminal blocks of telomeric repeats are sufficient to be recognized as telomeres. Moreover, artificial chromosomes containing telomere-associated Y' sequences and telomeric ARSs were no more stable during both mitosis and meiosis than artificial chromosomes lacking terminal ARSs, indicating that yeast-specific blocks of telomeric sequences are the only cis-acting requirement for a functional telomere during both mitotic growth and meiosis. The results also show that there is no requirement for an origin of replication on each arm of the artificial chromosomes, indicating that a replication fork may efficiently move through a functional centromere region.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22589733": "The centromeric regions of all Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes are found in early replicating domains, a property conserved among centromeres in fungi and some higher eukaryotes. Surprisingly, little is known about the biological significance or the mechanism of early centromere replication; however, the extensive conservation suggests that it is important for chromosome maintenance. Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions? In Candida albicans, a neocentromere contains an early firing origin, supporting the first hypothesis but not addressing whether the new origin is intrinsically early firing or whether the centromere influences replication time. Because the activation time of individual origins is not an intrinsic property of S. cerevisiae origins, but is influenced by surrounding sequences, we sought to test the hypothesis that centromeres influence replication time by moving a centromere to a late replication domain. We used a modified Meselson-Stahl density transfer assay to measure the kinetics of replication for regions of chromosome XIV in which either the functional centromere or a point-mutated version had been moved near origins that reside in a late replication region. We show that a functional centromere acts in cis over a distance as great as 19 kb to advance the initiation time of origins. Our results constitute a direct link between establishment of the kinetochore and the replication initiation machinery, and suggest that the proposed higher-order structure of the pericentric chromatin influences replication initiation.",

This species diverged from Saccharomyces cerevisiae before the ancestral whole genome duplication. The genome comprises eight chromosomes among which a chromosomal arm of 1 Mb has a G + C-content much higher than the rest of the genome. We identified 252 active replication origins in L. kluyveri and found considerable divergence in origin location with S. cerevisiae and with Lachancea waltii. Although some global features of S. cerevisiae replication are conserved: Centromeres replicate early, whereas telomeres replicate late, we found that replication origins both in L. kluyveri and L. waltii do not behave as evolutionary fragile sites. In L. kluyveri, replication timing along chromosomes alternates between regions of early and late activating origins, except for the 1 Mb GC-rich chromosomal arm. This chromosomal arm contains an origin consensus motif different from other chromosomes and is replicated early during S-phase. We showed that precocious replication results from the specific absence of late firing origins in this chromosomal arm. In addition, we found a correlation between GC-content and distance from replication origins as well as a lack of replication-associated compositional skew between leading and lagging strands specifically in this GC-rich chromosomal arm. These findings suggest that the unusual base composition in the genome of L. kluyveri could be linked to replication.",

Possible risks must be discussed with the obstetrician before travelling. If the pregnancy is uncomplicated most airlines allow flying up to the 36th (domestic flights) and 35th (international flights) week of gestation. Unless the fetal oxygen supply is already impaired at ground level due to an underlying disease, flying does not pose a risk of fetal hypoxia. Radiation exposure during a long distant flight is low compared to the average annual exposure dosage, but the risk of thrombosis is increased. Altitudes up to 2,500 m pose no problem. Sufficient time to acclimatize must be taken when travelling to high altitudes and exercise kept to a minimum. Scuba diving is contraindicated. Since only a few drugs are completely safe during pregnancy a thorough risk/benefit evaluation is mandatory. Treatment of infections can be considerably complicated, but any necessary treatment should not be withheld because of the fear of potential fetal injury. Good knowledge of local medical resources is essential before travelling. Several personal protective measures minimize the risk of infection: food and water precautions, protection from insect bites and avoidance of crowds, unsafe sex and, if need be, freshwater. Many vaccinations are recommended for travellers. However, live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnant women because of theoretical considerations. Exceptionally a yellow fever vaccination may be given after the first trimester. Killed, inactivated or polysaccharide vaccines can be given after the first trimester after a thorough risk/benefit evaluation. Because of the potentially devastating effect of malaria to the mother and the child, travelling to endemic malaria regions should be avoided.

Scuba diving also should be avoided throughout pregnancy because the fetus is at an increased risk for decompression sickness during this activity. In the absence of either medical or obstetric complications, 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise a day on most, if not all, days of the week is recommended for pregnant women.",

Many women are concerned about the risks associated with diving and a known or planned pregnancy. In order to advise these young women, we have reviewed the literature concerning women and diving as well as animal studies on the subject. The different international federations and the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society advise against scuba diving for pregnant women or those planning a pregnancy, but no randomized trials or trials provide a solid scientific basis. The fetal circulation is characterized by the exclusion of the pulmonary circulation by 2 right to left shunts. As the lung appears to act as a filter against the progression of micro-bubbles to the main circulation, the fetus may be therefore particularly exposed to gas emboli. However, the placenta could play this role in certain animal species. Nitrox diving appears to be particularly promising, but studies on the subject are still insufficient to recommend it for pregnant women.",

Individuals prone to panic attacks, claustrophobia or reckless risk-taking should avoid diving. In tolerating cold, muscle mass is more important than the amount of subcutaneous fat. The risk of decompression disease seems to be slightly greater among women, probably due to their fat distribution. Pregnant women are recommended not to dive, because the risk of birth defects seems to be greater among those who do, and there is a serious risk of fetal decompression disease. All participants in the sport must be responsible for their own diving safety.",

This review summarizes the physiological changes induced by immersion, diving and decompression, on male and female divers. Furthermore, it extends to literature review, in animal models, of the susceptibility of a pregnant animal to diving decompression injury. Publications regarding reports of diving injury in pregnant humans are also reviewed, comprising very recent material from the sport diving community. It is concluded that there is no countraindication to diving for the normal, healthy, nonpregnant female. However, pregnant females should refrain from diving, because the fetus is not protected from decompression problems and is at risk of malformation and gas embolism after decompression disease. It is prudent to advise pregnant patients of the increased risk of diving problems for the fetus during pregnancy. However, should a woman have completed a dive during early pregnancy because she was unaware she was pregnant, the present evidence is not to recommend an abortion, because several normal pregnancies have been documented even if diving is continued. Snorkeling can still be practiced during pregnancy, but scuba diving should be discontinued until after the birth period.",

As mechanisms of improvement and side effect differences remain unknown, we evaluated effects of corticosteroid administration on gene expression in blood of DMD patients. Whole blood was obtained from 14 children and adolescents with DMD treated with corticosteroids (DMD-STEROID) and 20 DMD children and adolescents na\u00efve to corticosteroids (DMD). The DMD-STEROID group was further subdivided into Deflazacort and prednisone groups. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression microarrays were used to evaluate mRNA expression. Expression of 524 probes changed with corticosteroids, including genes in iron trafficking and the chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis pathway. Deflazacort compared with prednisone yielded 508 regulated probes, including many involved in adipose metabolism. These genes and pathways help explain mechanisms of efficacy and side effects of corticosteroids, and could provide new treatment targets for DMD and other neuromuscular disorders.",

Although these biological effects of chicoric acid have been investigated, there are no reports of its antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effects in human mast cells (HMC)-1 or anaphylactic activity in a mouse model. Therefore, we investigated the antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effect of chicoric acid and its underlying mechanisms of action using phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI)-stimulated HMC-1 cells. Chicoric acid decreased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1\u03b2. We studied the inhibitory effects of chicoric acid on the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activation of caspase-1. However, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was not sufficient to abrogate the stimulus. In addition, we investigated the ability of chicoric acid to inhibit compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis in vivo. Oral administration of chicoric acid at 20 mg/kg inhibited histamine release and protected mice against compound 48/80-induced anaphylactic mortality. These results suggest that chicoric acid has an antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effect that involves modulating mast cell-mediated allergic responses.

Recent reports have highlighted the risk of allergic reactions to complementary medicines in atopic patients. To determine the characteristics of adverse reactions linked to use of the popular herbal remedy echinacea. Five privately referred patients were evaluated by the authors in their office practice via skin prick testing (SPT) on the volar aspect of the forearm and radioallergosorbent test after adverse reactions to echinacea. As there was little published information on adverse reactions to echinacea, reports to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee were reviewed. Those suggestive of possible allergic reactions were evaluated in greater detail by anonymously surveying the healthcare professionals who had reported the cases and from one unreported case. Serum was collected for further analysis where possible. Five cases of adverse reactions to echinacea were personally evaluated by the authors. Two patients suffered anaphylaxis and a third had an acute asthma attack 10 minutes after their first ever dose of echinacea. The fourth patient suffered recurrent episodes of mild asthma each time echinacea was ingested, and the fifth developed a maculopapular rash within 2 days of ingestion which recurred when rechallenged. Three of the patients had positive SPT results. Three reported repeated spontaneous \"challenges\" and symptoms after further ingestion of echinacea. Fifty-one Australian adverse drug reports implicating echinacea were also reviewed. There were 26 cases suggestive of possible immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity (4 anaphylaxis, 12 acute asthma, 10 urticaria/angioedema). Of these 26 patients, age ranged from 2 to 58 years, 78% were female and &gt;50% were known to be atopic. Four were hospitalized, 4 reacted after their first known exposure, and 1 patient suffered multiple progressive systemic reactions. Twenty percent of 100 atopic subjects who had never taken echinacea also had positive SPT results to this substance when tested by one of the authors in his office practice. Some atopic subjects have positive SPT results to echinacea in the absence of known exposure. Atopic subjects are also overrepresented in those experiencing reactions to echinacea. The possibility that cross-reactivity between echinacea and other environmental allergens may trigger allergic reactions in \"echinacea-na\u00efve\" subjects is supported by the Australian data.

They trans-synaptically interact with each other and induce synapse formation and maturation. Common variants and rare mutations, including copy number variations, short deletions, and single or small nucleotide changes in neurexin and neuroligin genes have been linked to the neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In this review, we summarize the structure and basic synaptic function of neurexins and neuroligins, followed by behaviors and synaptic phenotypes of knock-in and knock-out mouse of these family genes. From the studies of these mice, it turns out that the effects of neurexins and neuroligins are amazingly neural circuit dependent, even within the same brain region. In addition, neurexins and neuroligins are commonly involved in the endocannabinoid signaling. These finding may provide not only insight into understanding the pathophysiology, but also the concept for strategy of therapeutic intervention for ASDs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27725662": "Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that bind to presynaptic neurexins. Mutations in neuroligin-3 predispose to autism, but how such mutations affect synaptic function remains incompletely understood. Here we systematically examined the effect of three autism-associated mutations, the neuroligin-3 knockout, the R451C knockin, and the R704C knockin, on synaptic transmission in the calyx of Held, a central synapse ideally suited for high-resolution analyses of synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, germline knockout of neuroligin-3 did not alter synaptic transmission, whereas the neuroligin-3 R451C and R704C knockins decreased and increased, respectively, synaptic transmission. These puzzling results prompted us to ask whether neuroligin-3 mutant phenotypes may be reshaped by developmental plasticity. Indeed, conditional knockout of neuroligin-3 during late development produced a marked synaptic phenotype, whereas conditional knockout of neuroligin-3 during early development caused no detectable effect, mimicking the germline knockout. In canvassing potentially redundant candidate genes, we identified developmentally early expression of another synaptic neurexin ligand, cerebellin-1. Strikingly, developmentally early conditional knockout of cerebellin-1 only modestly impaired synaptic transmission, whereas in contrast to the individual single knockouts, developmentally early conditional double knockout of both cerebellin-1 and neuroligin-3 severely decreased synaptic transmission. Our data suggest an unanticipated mechanism of developmental compensation whereby cerebellin-1 and neuroligin-3 functionally occlude each other during development of calyx synapses. Thus, although acute manipulations more likely reveal basic gene functions, developmental plasticity can be a major factor in shaping the overall phenotypes of genetic neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Arguably, the best-characterized transsynaptic interactions are formed by presynaptic neurexins, which bind to diverse postsynaptic ligands. In a proteomic screen of neurexin-1 (Nrxn1) complexes immunoisolated from mouse brain, we identified carbonic anhydrase-related proteins CA10 and CA11, two homologous, secreted glycoproteins of unknown function that are predominantly expressed in brain. We found that CA10 directly binds in a <i>cis</i> configuration to a conserved membrane-proximal, extracellular sequence of \u03b1- and \u03b2-neurexins. The CA10-neurexin complex is stable and stoichiometric, and results in formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues in neurexins and CA10. CA10 promotes surface expression of \u03b1- and \u03b2-neurexins, suggesting that CA10 may form a complex with neurexins in the secretory pathway that facilitates surface transport of neurexins. Moreover, we observed that the Nrxn1 gene expresses from an internal 3' promoter a third isoform, Nrxn1\u03b3, that lacks all Nrxn1 extracellular domains except for the membrane-proximal sequences and that also tightly binds to CA10. Our data expand the understanding of neurexin-based transsynaptic interaction networks by providing further insight into the interactions nucleated by neurexins at the synapse.",

The presence of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in their postsynaptic density (PSD) distinguishes perisomatic synapses from GABAergic synapses on dendrites and the axon-initial segment. Targeted deletion of neuroligin 2 (NL2), a transmembrane protein interacting with presynaptic neurexin, has been reported to disrupt postsynaptic clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) and their anchoring protein, gephyrin, at perisomatic synapses. In contrast, targeted deletion of Gabra2 disrupts perisomatic clustering of gephyrin, but not of \u03b11-GABA<sub>A</sub>R, NL2, or dystrophin/dystroglycan. Unexpectedly, conditional deletion of Dag1, encoding dystroglycan, selectively prevents the formation of perisomatic GABAergic synapses from basket cells expressing cholecystokinin. Collectively, these observations suggest that multiple mechanisms regulate formation and molecular composition of the GABAergic PSD at perisomatic synapses. Here, we further explored this issue by investigating the effect of targeted deletion of Gabra1 and NL2 on the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and on perisomatic synapse formation, using immunofluorescence analysis with a battery of GABAergic pre- and postsynaptic markers. We show that the absence of \u03b11-GABA<sub>A</sub>R increases GABAergic synapses containing the \u03b12 subunit, without affecting the clustering of dystrophin and NL2; in contrast, the absence of NL2 produces highly variable effects postsynaptically, not restricted to perisomatic synapses and being more severe for the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits and gephyrin than dystrophin. Altogether, the results confirm the importance of NL2 as organizer of the GABAergic PSD and unravel distinct roles for \u03b11- and \u03b12-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the formation of GABAergic circuits in close interaction with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.",

We show that 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression. Further emphasizing the connection with gene expression, we find that 5hmC is enriched in active thymus-specific enhancers and that genes encoding key transcriptional regulators display high intragenic 5hmC levels in precursor cells at those developmental stages where they exert a positive effect.

Their existence and their fractality may have significant consequences for our understanding of the origin and evolution of genomes.

Although not integral parts of them, Alu-elements were found immediately upstream of all human and chimpanzee GA-sequences with an upstream poly(A)-segment. The article hypothesizes that genome navigation uses these properties of GA-sequences in the following way. (1) Poly(A) binding proteins interact with the upstream poly(A)-segments and arrange adjacent GA-sequences side-by-side ('GA-ribbon'), while folding the intervening DNA sequences between them into loops ('associated DNA-loops'). (2) Genome navigation uses the GA-ribbon as a search path for specific target genes that is up to 730-fold shorter than the full-length chromosome. (3) As to the specificity of the search, each molecule of a target protein is assumed to catalyze the formation of specific oligomers from a set of transcription factors that recognize tetra-GA-motifs. Their specific combinations of tetra-GA motifs are assumed to be present in the particular GA-sequence whose associated loop contains the gene for the target protein. As long as the target protein is abundant in the cell it produces sufficient numbers of such oligomers which bind to their specific GA-sequences and, thereby, inhibit locally the transcription of the target protein in the associated loop. However, if the amount of target protein drops below a certain threshold, the resultant reduction of specific oligomers leaves the corresponding GA-sequence 'denuded'. In response, the associated DNA-loop releases its nucleosomes and allows transcription of the target protein to proceed. (4) The Alu-transcripts may help control the general background of protein synthesis proportional to the number of transcriptionally active associated loops, especially in stressed cells. (5) The model offers a new mechanism of co-regulation of protein synthesis based on the shared segments of different GA-sequences.",

With the exception of a small number of poly-A-, poly-G-, poly-GA-, and poly-GAAA-sequences (combined &lt;0.5%), all pure GA-sequences of the mammals tested were unique individuals, contained several repeated short GA-containing motifs, and shared a common hexa-nucleotide spectrum. At most 2% of the human GA-sequences were transcribed into mRNAs; all others were not coding for proteins. Although this could have made them less subject to natural selection, they contained many [corrected] times fewer point mutations than one should expect from the genome at large. As to the presence of other sequences with similarly restricted base contents, there were approximately as many pure TC-sequences as pure GA-sequences, but many fewer pure AC-, TA, and TG-sequences. There were practically no pure GC-sequences. The functions of pure GA-sequences are not known.

The optical properties of this novel antiparallel structure are different from the parallel stranded homoduplex formed by d(GA)G7. This alpha/beta hairpin has a remarkably high Tm of 44.5 degrees C in 0.4 M NaCl with a van't Hoff enthalpy comparable to that of a parallel d(GA)n duplex. Base pairing was confirmed by T4 polynucleotide ligase catalyzed joining of the alpha/beta hairpin to an antiparallel bimolecular duplex and by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis using duplexes containing sequence constraints.

Desirable characteristics include the ability to inhibit melanogenesis in cells (IC50 &lt; 100 microg/mL) without cytotoxicity, preferably due to tyrosinase inhibition. Of the six esters synthesized, the smaller esters (e.g. methyl and ethyl) were more effective enzyme inhibitors (IC50 approximately 11 and 20 microg/mL, respectively). For comparison, hydroquinone (HQ), a commercial skin \"bleaching\" agent, was a less effective enzyme inhibitor (IC50 approximately 72 microg/mL), and was highly cytotoxic to melanocytes in vitro at concentrations substantially lower than the IC50 for enzymatic inhibition. Kojic acid was a potent inhibitor of the mammalian enzyme (IC50 approximately 6 microg/mL), but did not reduce pigmentation in cells. Both arbutin and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate were ineffective in the cell-free and cell-based assays. MG at 100 microg/mL exhibited a minimal inhibitory effect on DHICA oxidase (TRP 1) and no effect on DOPAchrome tautomerase (TRP-2), suggesting that MG inhibits melanogenesis primarily via tyrosinase inhibition. MG and GA were non-mutagenic at the hprt locus in V79 Chinese hamster cells, whereas HQ was highly mutagenic and cytotoxic. The properties of MG in vitro, including (1) pigmentation inhibition in melanocytes, (2) tyrosinase inhibition and selectivity, (3) reduced cytotoxicity relative to HQ, and (4) lack of mutagenic potential in mammalian cells, establish MG as a superior candidate skin-lightening agent.",

We present example applications including the analysis of an individual patient and a cohort-wide study, and provide a first extension of CVE by adding a tumour-specific co-expression network. The CVE package allows interactive variant prioritisation to expedite the analysis of cancer sequencing studies. Our framework also includes the prioritisation of druggable targets, allows exploratory analysis of tissue specific networks and is extendable for specific applications by virtue of its modular design. We encourage the use of CVE within translational research studies and molecular tumour boards. The CVE package is available via Bioconductor ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/CVE/ ).",

However, the UCSs are still regarded as mysterious genetic sequences so far. Here, we present a systematic study of ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast based on the publicly available genome sequences, in order to reveal their relationship with the adaptability or fitness advantages of the budding yeast. Our results indicate that, in addition to some fundamental biological functions, the UCSs play an important role in the adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the acidic environment, which is backed up by the previous observation. Besides that, we also find the highly unchanged genes are enriched in some other pathways, such as the nutrient-sensitive signaling pathway. To facilitate the investigation of unique UCSs, the UCSC Genome Browser was utilized to visualize the chromosomal position and related annotations of UCSs in S.cerevisiae genome. For more details on UCSs, please refer to the Supplementary information online, and the custom code is available on request. fgao@tju.edu.cn.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22347799": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of tau protein aggregates in the basal ganglia, brainstem and cerebral cortex leading to rapid disease progression and death. The neurofibrillary tangles that define the neuropathology of PSP are comprised of aggregated 4R tau and show a well-defined distribution. Classically, PSP is diagnosed by symptoms that include progressive gait disturbance, early falls, vertical ophthalmoparesis, akinetic-rigid features, prominent bulbar dysfunction and fronto-subcortical dementia. There are currently no effective therapies for the treatment of this rapidly degenerating and debilitating disease. Davunetide is a novel neuroprotective peptide that is thought to impact neuronal integrity and cell survival through the stabilization of microtubules. Preclinical activity in models of tauopathy has been translated to clinical studies, demonstrating pharmacologic activity that has supported further development. Davunetide's efficacy and tolerability are being tested in a placebo-controlled study in PSP patients, making it the most advanced drug candidate in this indication. This review examines the disease characteristics of PSP, the rationale for treating PSP with davunetide and assesses some of the challenges of clinical trials in this patient population.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697827": "Non-coding (nc)RNAs are key players in numerous biological processes such as gene regulation, chromatin domain formation and genome stability. Large ncRNAs interact with histone modifiers and are involved in cancer development, X-chromosome inactivation and autosomal gene imprinting. However, despite recent evidence showing that pervasive transcription is more widespread than previously thought, only a few examples mediating gene regulation in eukaryotes have been described. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bona-fide regulatory ncRNAs are destabilized by the Xrn1 5'-3' RNA exonuclease (also known as Kem1), but the genome-wide characterization of the entire regulatory ncRNA family remains elusive. Here, using strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs) in which 66% are antisense to open reading frames. These transcripts are polyadenylated and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent. The majority of XUTs strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions. Notably, RNAPII chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of RNAPII occupancy over 273 genes with antisense XUTs. These genes show an unusual bias for H3K4me3 marks and require the Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyl-transferase for silencing. Furthermore, abolishing H3K4me3 triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense XUTs, supporting a model in which H3K4me3 antagonizes antisense ncRNA repressive activity. Our results demonstrate that antisense ncRNA-mediated regulation is a general regulatory pathway for gene expression in S. cerevisiae.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26805575": "Antisense long non-coding (aslnc)RNAs represent a substantial part of eukaryotic transcriptomes that are, in yeast, controlled by the Xrn1 exonuclease. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear. We report that 3' single-stranded (3'-ss) extension mediates XUTs degradation by NMD, assisted by the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases. Single-gene investigation, genome-wide RNA analyses, and double-stranded (ds)RNA mapping revealed that 3'-ss extensions discriminate the NMD-targeted XUTs from stable lncRNAs. Ribosome profiling showed that XUT are translated, locking them for NMD activity. Interestingly, mutants of the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases accumulated XUTs, suggesting that dsRNA unwinding is a critical step for degradation. Indeed, expression of anticomplementary transcripts protects cryptic intergenic lncRNAs from NMD. Our results indicate that aslncRNAs form dsRNA that are only translated and targeted to NMD if dissociated by Mtr4 and Dbp2. We propose that NMD buffers genome expression by discarding pervasive regulatory transcripts.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29114019": "Antisense transcription can regulate sense gene expression. However, previous annotations of antisense transcription units have been based on detection of mature antisense long noncoding (aslnc)RNAs by RNA-seq and/or microarrays, only giving a partial view of the antisense transcription landscape and incomplete molecular bases for antisense-mediated regulation. Here, we used native elongating transcript sequencing to map genome-wide nascent antisense transcription in fission yeast. Strikingly, antisense transcription was detected for most protein-coding genes, correlating with low sense transcription, especially when overlapping the mRNA start site. RNA profiling revealed that the resulting aslncRNAs mainly correspond to cryptic Xrn1/Exo2-sensitive transcripts (XUTs). ChIP-seq analyses showed that antisense (as)XUT's expression is associated with specific histone modification patterns. Finally, we showed that asXUTs are controlled by the histone chaperone Spt6 and respond to meiosis induction, in both cases anti-correlating with levels of the paired-sense mRNAs, supporting physiological significance to antisense-mediated gene attenuation. Our work highlights that antisense transcription is much more extended than anticipated and might constitute an additional nonpromoter determinant of gene regulation complexity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21653552": "DevR regulon function is believed to be crucial for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during dormancy. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the DevR regulon. All the regulon promoters were assigned to four classes based on the number of DevR binding sites (Dev boxes). A minimum of two boxes are essential for complete interaction and their tandem arrangement is an architectural hallmark at all promoters. Initial interaction of DevR with the conserved box is essential for its cooperative binding to adjacent sites bearing low to very poor sequence conservation and is the universal mechanism underlying DevR-mediated transcriptional induction. The functional importance of tandem arrangement was established by analyzing promoter variants harboring Dev boxes with altered spacing. Conserved sequence logos were generated from 47 binding sequences which included 24 newly discovered Dev boxes. In each half site of an 18-bp binding motif, G(5) and C(7) are essential for DevR binding. Finally, we show that DevR regulon induction occurs in a temporal manner and genes that are induced early are also usually powerfully induced. The information theory-based approach along with binding and temporal expression studies provide us with comprehensive insights into the complex pattern of DevR regulon activation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18294384": " Low oxygen availability has been shown previously to stimulate M. tuberculosis to establish non-replicative persistence in vitro. The two component sensor/regulator dosRS is a major mediator in the transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and controls a regulon of approximately 50 genes that are induced under this condition. The aim of this study was to determine whether the induction of the entire DosR regulon is triggered as a synchronous event or if induction can unfold as a cascade of events as the differential expression of subsets of genes is stimulated by different oxygen availabilities. A novel aspect of our work is the use of chemostat cultures of M. tuberculosis which allowed us to control environmental conditions very tightly. We exposed M. tuberculosis to a sudden drop in oxygen availability in chemostat culture and studied the transcriptional response of the organism during the transition from a high oxygen level (10% dissolved oxygen tension or DOT) to a low oxygen level (0.2% DOT) using DNA microarrays. We developed a Bayesian change point analysis method that enabled us to detect subtle shifts in the timing of gene induction. It results in probabilities of a change in gene expression at certain time points. A computational analysis of potential binding sites upstream of the DosR-controlled genes shows how the transcriptional responses of these genes are influenced by the affinity of these binding sites to DosR. Our study also indicates that a subgroup of DosR-controlled genes is regulated indirectly. The majority of the dosR-dependent genes were up-regulated at 0.2% DOT, which confirms previous findings that these genes are triggered by hypoxic environments. However, our change point analysis also highlights genes which were up-regulated earlier at levels of about 8% DOT indicating that they respond to small fluctuations in oxygen availability. Our analysis shows that there are pairs of divergent genes where one gene in the pair is up-regulated before the other, presumably for a flexible response to a constantly changing environment in the host.",

Relatively little is known about the immune response profiles following BCG vaccination in relation to protection against TB. Here we tested whether BCG vaccination results in immune responses to DosR (Rv3133c) regulon-encoded proteins. These so-called TB latency antigens are targeted by the immune system during persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and have been associated with immunity against latent M. tuberculosis infection. In silico analysis of the DosR regulon in BCG and M. tuberculosis showed at least 97% amino acid sequence homology, with 41 out of 48 genes being identical. Transcriptional profiling of 14 different BCG strains, under hypoxia and nitric oxide exposure in vitro, revealed a functional DosR regulon similar to that observed in M. tuberculosis. Next, we assessed human immune responses to a series of immunodominant TB latency antigens and found that BCG vaccination fails to induce significant responses to latency antigens. Similar results were obtained with BCG-vaccinated BALB/c mice. In contrast, responses to latency antigens were observed in individuals with suspected exposure to TB (as indicated by positive gamma interferon responses to TB-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10) and in mice vaccinated with plasmid DNA encoding selected latency antigens. Since immune responses to TB latency antigens have been associated with control of latent M. tuberculosis infection, our findings support the development of vaccination strategies incorporating DosR regulon antigens to complement and improve the current BCG vaccine.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28196106": "Drosophila melanogaster is a common model used to study circadian rhythms in behavior and circadian clocks. However, numerous circadian rhythms have also been detected in non-clock neurons, especially in the first optic neuropil (lamina) of the fly's visual system. Such rhythms have been observed in the number of synapses and in the structure of interneurons, which exhibit changes in size and shape in a circadian manner. Although the patterns of these changes are known, the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy in regulating circadian rhythms based on the behavior and structural plasticity of the lamina L2 monopolar cell dendritic trees. In addition, we examined the cyclic expression of the TOR signaling pathway (Tor, Pi3K class 1, Akt1) and autophagy (Atg5 and Atg7) genes in the fly's brain. We observed that Tor, Atg5 and Atg7 exhibit rhythmic expressions in the brain of wild-type flies in day/night conditions (LD 12:12) that are abolished in per01 clock mutants. The silencing of Tor in per expressing cells shortens a period of the locomotor activity rhythm of flies. In addition, silencing of the Tor and Atg5 genes in L2 cells disrupts the circadian plasticity of the L2 cell dendritic trees measured in the distal lamina. In turn, silencing of the Atg7 gene in L2 cells changes the pattern of this rhythm. Our results indicate that the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the behavior and plasticity of neurons in the brain of adult flies.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28721811": " The mammalian circadian clock and its associated clock genes are increasingly been recognized as critical components for a number of physiological and disease processes that extend beyond hormone release, thermal regulation, and sleep-wake cycles. New evidence suggests that clinical behavior disruptions that involve prolonged shift work and even space travel may negatively impact circadian rhythm and lead to multi-system disease. In light of the significant role circadian rhythm can hold over the body's normal physiology as well as disease processes, we examined and discussed the impact circadian rhythm and clock genes hold over lifespan, neurodegenerative disorders, and tumorigenesis. In experimental models, lifespan is significantly reduced with the introduction of arrhythmic mutants and leads to an increase in oxidative stress exposure. Interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may suffer disease onset or progression as a result of alterations in the DNA methylation of clock genes as well as prolonged pharmacological treatment for these disorders that may lead to impairment of circadian rhythm function. Tumorigenesis also can occur with the loss of a maintained circadian rhythm and lead to an increased risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the circadian clock system relies upon the regulation of the critical pathways of autophagy, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1) as well as proliferative mechanisms that involve the wingless pathway of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway to foster cell survival during injury and block tumor cell growth. Future targeting of the pathways of autophagy, mTOR, SIRT1, and Wnt that control mammalian circadian rhythm may hold the key for the development of novel and effective therapies against aging- related disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and tumorigenesis.",

Proper timing of hormone secretion, metabolism, bile acid turnover, autophagy, and inflammation with behavioral cycles is necessary to avoid dysmetabolism.

Here, we report that a circadian clock gene, <i>brain and muscle Arnt-like 1</i> (<i>Bmal1</i>), increases autophagy in high-glucose-induced cardiomyocyte injury. We constructed a hyperglycemia model with cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats. High-glucose-induced inhibition of autophagy and cardiomyocyte injury were attenuated by <i>Bmal1</i> overexpression and aggravated by its knockdown. Furthermore, autophagy stabilization by 3-methyladenine or rapamycin partially suppressed the effects of altered <i>Bmal1</i> expression on cardiomyocyte survival. Mechanistically, <i>Bmal1</i> mediated resistance to high-glucose-induced inhibition of autophagy at least partly by inhibiting mTOR signaling activity. Collectively, our findings suggest that the clock gene <i>Bmal1</i> is a positive regulator of autophagy through the mTOR signaling pathway and protects cardiomyocytes against high-glucose toxicity.",

The mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of autophagy, however, are still unclear. Here, we observed that numbers of autophagosomes and autolysosomes exhibit daily rhythms in the zebrafish liver, and cebpb/(c/ebp\u03b2) and various autophagy genes are rhythmically expressed in zebrafish larvae but significantly upregulated in per1b and TALEN-generated nr1d1/rev-erb\u03b1 mutant fish, indicating that both Per1b and Nr1d1 play critical roles in autophagy rhythms. Luciferase reporter and ChIP assays show that the circadian clock directly regulates autophagy genes through Nr1d1, and also regulates transcription of cebpb through Per1b. We also found that fasting leads to altered expression of both circadian clock genes and autophagy genes in zebrafish adult peripheral organs. Further, transcriptome analysis reveals multiple functions of Nr1d1 in zebrafish. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for how the circadian clock regulates autophagy, imply that nutritional signaling affects both circadian regulation and autophagy activities in peripheral organs, and shed light on how circadian gene mutations act through autophagy to contribute to common metabolic diseases such as obesity.",

Whether the several signaling molecules, receptors, and synaptic proteins currently implicated in ARM operate in one or more pathways and how they function in the process remain unclear. We present evidence that Drk, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of the adaptor protein Grb2, is essential for ARM within adult mushroom body neurons. Significantly, Drk signals engage the Rho kinase Drok, implicating dynamic cytoskeletal changes in ARM, and this is supported by reduced F-actin in the mutants and after pharmacological inhibition of Drok. Interestingly, Drk-Drok signaling appears independent of the function of Radish (Rsh), a protein long implicated in ARM, suggesting that the process involves at least two distinct molecular pathways. Based on these results, we propose that signaling pathways involved in structural plasticity likely underlie this form of translation-independent memory.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether the novel JAK inhibitor oclacitinib could reduce the activity of cytokines implicated in canine allergic skin disease. Using isolated enzyme systems and in vitro human or canine cell models, potency and selectivity of oclacitinib was determined against JAK family members and cytokines that trigger JAK activation in cells. Oclacitinib inhibited JAK family members by 50% at concentrations (IC50 's) ranging from 10 to 99 nm and did not inhibit a panel of 38 non-JAK kinases (IC50 's &gt; 1000 nM). Oclacitinib was most potent at inhibiting JAK1 (IC50 = 10 nM). Oclacitinib also inhibited the function of JAK1-dependent cytokines involved in allergy and inflammation (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13) as well as pruritus (IL-31) at IC50 's ranging from 36 to 249 nM. Oclacitinib had minimal effects on cytokines that did not activate the JAK1 enzyme in cells (erythropoietin, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-12, IL-23; IC50 's &gt; 1000 nM). These results demonstrate that oclacitinib is a targeted therapy that selectively inhibits JAK1-dependent cytokines involved in allergy, inflammation, and pruritus and suggests these are the mechanisms by which oclacitinib effectively controls clinical signs associated with allergic skin disease in dogs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748519": "Three-dimensional genome structure plays an important role in gene regulation. Globally, chromosomes are organized into active and inactive compartments while, at the gene level, looping interactions connect promoters to regulatory elements. Topologically associating domains (TADs), typically several hundred kilobases in size, form an intermediate level of organization. Major questions include how TADs are formed and how they are related to looping interactions between genes and regulatory elements. Here we performed a focused 5C analysis of a 2.8 Mb chromosome 7 region surrounding CFTR in a panel of cell types. We find that the same TAD boundaries are present in all cell types, indicating that TADs represent a universal chromosome architecture. Furthermore, we find that these TAD boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In contrast, looping interactions between promoters and regulatory elements are cell-type specific and occur mostly within TADs. This is exemplified by the CFTR promoter that in different cell types interacts with distinct sets of distal cell-type-specific regulatory elements that are all located within the same TAD. Finally, we find that long-range associations between loci located in different TADs are also detected, but these display much lower interaction frequencies than looping interactions within TADs. Interestingly, interactions between TADs are also highly cell-type-specific and often involve loci clustered around TAD boundaries. These data point to key roles of invariant TAD boundaries in constraining as well as mediating cell-type-specific long-range interactions and gene regulation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26518482": "Recent advances enabled by the Hi-C technique have unraveled many principles of chromosomal folding that were subsequently linked to disease and gene regulation. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. To explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed Hi-C and poly(A)(+) RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2, Kc167, DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find that regions between TADs (i.e., the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes. Accordingly, we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw) predicts TAD boundaries much worse than active chromatin marks do. Interestingly, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted inter-bands of polytene chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands. Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. We propose the mechanism of TAD self-assembly based on the ability of nucleosomes from inactive chromatin to aggregate, and lack of this ability in acetylated nucleosomal arrays. Finally, we test this hypothesis by polymer simulations and find that TAD partitioning may be explained by different modes of inter-nucleosomal interactions for active and inactive chromatin.",

The recently developed Hi-C technology is an efficacious method to investigate genome packing. Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that local chromatin packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized segments that have much higher intrachromosome interaction rates than neighboring regions, representing a dominant local structural feature of genome conformation in A. thaliana. These regions, which appear as positive strips on two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction, are enriched in epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1, and H3.3. We also identify more than 400 insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not an obvious feature of A. thaliana genome packing, we found more than 1000 regions that have properties of TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions analogous to the interior of TADs. The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels. We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity combine to shape the local packing of the A. thaliana nuclear genome.",

We demonstrate that disruption of TADs can rewire long-range regulatory architecture and result in pathogenic phenotypes. We show that distinct human limb malformations are caused by deletions, inversions, or duplications altering the structure of the TAD-spanning WNT6/IHH/EPHA4/PAX3 locus. Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we generated mice with corresponding rearrangements. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus. This rewiring occurred only if the variant disrupted a CTCF-associated boundary domain. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome.",

Here we perform genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq to obtain comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and to dissect X chromosome dosage compensation, which balances gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The dosage compensation complex (DCC), a condensin complex, binds to both hermaphrodite X chromosomes via sequence-specific recruitment elements on X (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Most DCC condensin subunits also act in other condensin complexes to control the compaction and resolution of all mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. By comparing chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos, we show that the DCC remodels hermaphrodite X chromosomes into a sex-specific spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. Dosage-compensated X chromosomes consist of self-interacting domains (\u223c1 Mb) resembling mammalian topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs on X chromosomes have stronger boundaries and more regular spacing than on autosomes. Many TAD boundaries on X chromosomes coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites and become diminished or lost in DCC-defective mutants, thereby converting the topology of X to a conformation resembling autosomes. rex sites engage in DCC-dependent long-range interactions, with the most frequent interactions occurring between rex sites at DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. These results imply that the DCC reshapes the topology of X chromosomes by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing weak boundaries through interactions between its highest-affinity binding sites. As this model predicts, deletion of an endogenous rex site at a DCC-dependent TAD boundary using CRISPR/Cas9 greatly diminished the boundary. Thus, the DCC imposes a distinct higher-order structure onto X chromosomes while regulating gene expression chromosome-wide.",

Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes. We show that the MSL complex regulates nucleosome positioning at HAS, therefore acting locally rather than influencing the overall chromosomal architecture. We propose that the sex-independent, three-dimensional conformation of the X chromosome poises it for exploitation by the MSL complex, thereby facilitating spreading in males.",

Demographic data, clinical features and disease activity were recorded. AIHA was defined according to the presence of anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL) and evidence of hemolysis (reticulocytosis and positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT)/Coombs test) at SLE diagnosis. Evans syndrome (ES) was defined by the combination of immune thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) and AIHA. Results The frequency of AIHA at diagnosis was significantly higher in cSLE patients compared to aSLE (49/336 (14%) vs 49/1830 (3%), p = 0.0001), with similar frequency of ES (3/336 (0.9%) vs 10/1830 (0.5%), p = 0.438).

For patients with persistent disease, limited options for effective and well-tolerated therapies exist. Our aim is to describe our institution's experience with sirolimus as therapy for pediatric patients with persistent ITP and ES. A retrospective analysis was performed in patients with persistent ITP and ES treated with sirolimus. Responses were categorized as complete response (CR), partial response, modest response, or no response. Of the 17 patients treated, 12 had ITP and 5 had ES. Seventy-three percent of ITP patients achieved a CR, 78% of them by 3 months. Only 2 patients did not achieve a durable response. Eighty percent of ES patients had a response, with 50% of them achieving CR and the other 50% an asymptomatic partial response. One patient with ES achieved modest response, but discontinued therapy due to an adverse effect. Of the patients that achieved CR, 90% remain off all therapy for a median of 2 years. Our data suggest that sirolimus is a safe and effective steroid-sparing agent in the treatment of persistent ITP and ES.",

The variation of recombination rate at both fine and large scales cannot be fully explained by DNA sequences alone. Epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation, have recently been proposed to influence the variation in recombination rate. We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets (Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a \"recombination rate valley\" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy. Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations.",

In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these variants with an extensive molecular dynamics study of the canonical nucleosome along with three variant-containing structures: H2A.Z, macroH2A, and an H2A mutant with macroH2A-like L1 loops. Simulation results show that variant L1 loops play a pivotal role in stabilizing DNA binding to the octamer through direct interactions, core structural rearrangements, and altered allosteric networks in the nucleosome. All variants influence dynamics; however, macroH2A-like systems have the largest effect on energetics. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of allosteric networks in the nucleosome and demonstrate that variants take advantage of stronger interactions between L1 loops to propagate dynamics throughout the complex.

Using the data generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have identified positions of nucleosomes containing the H2A.Z histone variant and histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 in human CD4(+) T-cells. We find that the 10-bp periodicity observed in nucleosomal sequences in yeast and other organisms is not pronounced in human nucleosomal sequences. This result was confirmed for a broader set of mononucleosomal fragments that were not selected for any specific histone variant or modification. We also find that human H2A.Z nucleosomes protect only approximately 120 bp of DNA from MNase digestion and exhibit specific sequence preferences, suggesting a novel mechanism of nucleosome organization for the H2A.Z variant.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16248679": "H2A.Z is an evolutionary conserved histone variant involved in transcriptional regulation, antisilencing, silencing, and genome stability. The mechanism(s) by which H2A.Z regulates these various biological functions remains poorly defined, in part due to the lack of knowledge regarding its physical location along chromosomes and the bearing it has in regulating chromatin structure. Here we mapped H2A.Z across the yeast genome at an approximately 300-bp resolution, using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with tiling microarrays. We have identified 4,862 small regions--typically one or two nucleosomes wide--decorated with H2A.Z. Those \"Z loci\" are predominantly found within specific nucleosomes in the promoter of inactive genes all across the genome. Furthermore, we have shown that H2A.Z can regulate nucleosome positioning at the GAL1 promoter. Within HZAD domains, the regions where H2A.Z shows an antisilencing function, H2A.Z is localized in a wider pattern, suggesting that the variant histone regulates a silencing and transcriptional activation via different mechanisms. Our data suggest that the incorporation of H2A.Z into specific promoter-bound nucleosomes configures chromatin structure to poise genes for transcriptional activation. The relevance of these findings to higher eukaryotes is discussed.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613878": "H2A.Z is a highly conserved histone variant in all species. The chromatin deposition of H2A.Z is specifically catalyzed by the yeast chromatin remodeling complex SWR1 and its mammalian counterpart SRCAP. However, the mechanism by which H2A.Z is preferentially recognized by non-histone proteins remains elusive. Here we identified Anp32e, a novel higher eukaryote-specific histone chaperone for H2A.Z. Anp32e preferentially associates with H2A.Z-H2B dimers rather than H2A-H2B dimers in vitro and in vivo and dissociates non-nucleosomal aggregates formed by DNA and H2A-H2B. We determined the crystal structure of the Anp32e chaperone domain (186-232) in complex with the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. In this structure, the region containing Anp32e residues 214-224, which is absent in other Anp32 family proteins, specifically interacts with the extended H2A.Z \u03b1C helix, which exhibits an unexpected conformational change. Genome-wide profiling of Anp32e revealed a remarkable co-occupancy between Anp32e and H2A.Z. Cells overexpressing Anp32e displayed a strong global H2A.Z loss at the +1 nucleosomes, whereas cells depleted of Anp32e displayed a moderate global H2A.Z increase at the +1 nucleosomes. This suggests that Anp32e may help to resolve the non-nucleosomal H2A.Z aggregates and also facilitate the removal of H2A.Z at the +1 nucleosomes, and the latter may help RNA polymerase II to pass the first nucleosomal barrier.",

Using a 2-stage design, 77 eligible participants (27 in stage 1, if favorable, and then 50 in stage 2) were needed to detect an absolute improvement in the proportion of patients either alive and progression-free patients at 6 months (6mPFS) or responding (any duration) from a historical 11% to 25%. A high rate of ineligibility (27%) to stage 1 precluded a powered assessment of efficacy, but there was also infrequent treatment-related toxicity at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, the study was redesigned to allow intrapatient escalation by 50 mg daily every cycle as tolerated (stage 1B) before determining whether to proceed to stage 2. Escalation was tolerable in 10 of 17 (59%) participants evaluable for that endpoint; however, among all eligible patients (stages 1 and 1B, n = 50), there were no radiographic responses, median overall survival was 7.9 months, median PFS was 1.7 months, and the 6mPFS rate was 6%.

The study was designed as multicenter, randomized phase II trial, preceded by a lead-in safety phase. The safety component reported here, which also investigated pharmacokinetics and preliminary clinical activity, required expansion and is therefore considered a phase I part to establish a recommended dosing regimen of the combination of CCNU (90-110 mg/m(2)) and dasatinib (100-200 mg daily). Overall, 28 patients were screened, and 26 patients were enrolled. Five dose levels were explored. DLTs, mainly myelosuppression, occurred in 10 patients.

For instance, three minimal absent words of the human genome were found in Ebola virus genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n bytes of RAM. Such memory requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words in large datasets. We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than 3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as 1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations. https://github.com/solonas13/maw (free software under the terms of the GNU GPL). alice.heliou@lix.polytechnique.fr or solon.pissis@kcl.ac.uk.

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that IVIG has anti-amyloid and immune modulatory properties relevant to treating neurodegenerative disorders. In early stage AD clinical trials, IVIG was found to reduce cognitive decline and increase brain glucose metabolism. Unfortunately, IVIG failed to meet primary outcome objectives in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial in mild to moderate AD. However, positive cognitive signals were observed in pre-planned subgroup analyses among APOE-\u03b54 carriers and moderately impaired AD patients. Biomarker studies revealed dose dependent increases in plasma and CSF immunoglobulins and decreases in beta amyloid-42 levels. In addition, IVIG treatment was generally safe and well-tolerated. These findings suggest that naturally occurring human anti-amyloid antibodies may play a physiologic role in the clearance of aggregated amyloid proteins. While the results of clinical trials to date do not provide support for the use of IVIG to treat AD at the doses tested, additional studies of IVIG's mechanisms are warranted and may guide the development of more effective therapies for AD in the future.",

Preoperatively, urethral mobility was measured by Q tip test. All women were asked to complete Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form (UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7) to assess the quality of life. Six months postoperatively, Q tip test and quality of life assessment were repeated. The primary surgical outcomes were classified as cure, improvement and failure. Transient urinary obstruction, de novo urgency, voiding dysfunction were secondary surgical outcomes. Of 141 women, 50 (35. 5%) women underwent TOT, 91 (64.5%) underwent TVT. In both TOT and TVT groups, postoperative Q tip test values, IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scores were statistically reduced when compared with preoperative values. Postoperative Q tip test value in TVT group was significantly smaller than in TOT group [25\u00b0(15-45\u00b0) and 20\u00b0 (15-45\u00b0), respectively].

Prospective study with a follow-up questionnaire administered by telephone. Tertiary-care children's hospital. One hundred thirty-four children between the ages of 4 and 18 years who underwent adenotonsillectomy between December 1997 and June 1998 and did not have associated cardiac, pulmonary, bleeding, or syndromic disorders were included in this pilot study. Parents of these patients were given the opportunity to participate in our study, and it was emphasized that, at any time during the child's care, if the parent desired a follow-up visit or if the child experienced any symptoms that caused concern, the parent should contact the clinic for a follow-up appointment. A telephone call was placed 3 to 4 weeks postoperatively by an otolaryngology nurse, and a questionnaire was filled out using the parents' responses. The incidence rates of voice change, velopharyngeal insufficiency, bleeding, constipation, dehydration, and pain were measured. Parent satisfaction, patient safety, and cost-benefit were also evaluated. Less than 5% of patients reported temporary velopharyngeal insufficiency, while 2% of patients required operative intervention for bleeding episodes and 1% required hospitalization. Voice change, reported by approximately 70% of all patients, was the most common complaint, but it resolved in all instances. Pain was reported to be most severe on postoperative day 1. Ninety-six percent of parents requested no further follow-up visit. Our pilot study revealed that a follow-up telephone call is a safe and cost-effective method of postoperative management for pediatric patients who have undergone adenotonsillectomy and that this method of follow-up is also desirable to parents.",

A total of 26 adults who had tonsillectomy due to chronic tonsillitis or recurrent acute tonsillitis were included in the study. The voice performances of the participants were analyzed with objective and subjective methods before surgery, and 1 and 3 months after surgery. An acoustic voice analysis (fundamental frequency [F0], jitter %, shimmer %) was performed for objective analysis, and Voice Handicap Index survey was used for subjective analysis of the voice. Preoperative F0, jitter %, shimmer %, and Voice Handicap Index values were compared with the values obtained 1 and 3 months after surgery. Impairment of voice performance was determined when preoperative and postoperative first month F0, jitter %, and shimmer % values were compared. Three months after surgery, those values were found similar to the preoperative values. Tonsillectomy affects voice performance negatively in adults in short term; however, it does not affect voice performance in long term after surgery.",

Patient opinion measures included Voice Handicap Index score, perception of vocal resonance, and change in voice.

Nine patients (20%) perceived their voice to be improved after surgery. None perceived the voice to be worse. Postoperative changes in relative formant amplitudes were statistically significant. These changes caused the acoustic features to become more representative of normative data than the preoperative values. Upper airway oeprations can affect acoustics and perception of voice.

Considering the complexity of the interferon response, the identification of further monogenic diseases belonging to this disease grouping seems likely, with the recognition of type I interferonopathies becoming of increasing clinical importance as treatment options are developed based on an understanding of disease pathology and innate immune signaling. Definition of the type I interferonopathies indicates that autoinflammation can be both interferon and noninterferon related, and that a primary disturbance of the innate immune system can \"spill over\" into autoimmunity in some cases. Indeed, that several non-Mendelian disorders, most particularly systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis, are also characterized by an up-regulation of type I interferon signaling suggests the possibility that insights derived from this work will have relevance to a broader field of clinical medicine.",

However, as well cases of families with mutations in the SAMHD1 gene and, recently, with one for the gene that codes for the protein stimulator of interferon genes have been described. These genes are involved in the process of the detection of intracellular DNA, and their mutation results in an increased production of type I interferons and their gene products, resulting in auto-inflammation and auto-immunity.

A recently discovered DNA-activated type I IFN pathway, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), has been linked to Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome and mouse models of lupus. The aim of this study was to determine whether the cGAS pathway contributes to type I IFN production in patients with SLE. SLE disease activity was measured by the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. Expression of messenger RNA for cGAS and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) levels were examined by multiple reaction monitoring with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Expression of cGAS in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly higher in SLE patients than in normal controls (n = 51 and n = 20 respectively; P &lt; 0.01). There was a positive correlation between cGAS expression and the IFN score (P &lt; 0.001). The expression of cGAS in PBMCs showed a dose response to type I IFN stimulation in vitro, consistent with it being an ISG. Targeted measurement of cGAMP by tandem mass spectrometry detected cGAMP in 15% of the SLE patients (7 of 48) but none of the normal (0 of 19) or rheumatoid arthritis (0 of 22) controls. Disease activity was higher in SLE patients with cGAMP versus those without cGAMP. Increased cGAS expression and cGAMP in a proportion of SLE patients indicates that the cGAS pathway should be considered as a contributor to type I IFN production. Whereas higher cGAS expression may be a consequence of exposure to type I IFN, detection of cGAMP in patients with increased disease activity indicates potential involvement of this pathway in disease expression.",

These cytokines are produced via activation of numerous pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptor signaling network, retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5) and interferon gamma-inducible protein-16 (IFI-16). Whilst the contribution of type I IFNs to peripheral immunity is well documented, they can also be produced by almost every cell in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, IFNs can reach the CNS from the periphery to modulate the function of not only microglia and astrocytes, but also neurons and oligodendrocytes, with major consequences for cognition and behavior. Given the pleiotropic nature of type I IFNs, it is critical to determine their exact cellular impact. Inappropriate upregulation of type I IFN signaling and interferon-stimulated gene expression have been linked to several CNS diseases termed \"interferonopathies\" including Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18)-deficiency. In contrast, in the CNS of mice with virus-induced neuroinflammation, type I IFNs can limit production of other cytokines to prevent potential damage associated with chronic cytokine expression. This capacity of type I IFNs could also explain the therapeutic benefits of exogenous type I IFN in chronic CNS autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In this review we will highlight the importance of a well-balanced level of type I IFNs for healthy brain physiology, and to what extent dysregulation of this cytokine system can result in brain 'interferonopathies'.",

Here, we employ a screen to identify partners of budding yeast Cdc48 that are important for disassembly of ubiquitylated CMG helicase at the end of chromosome replication. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin-binding Ufd1-Npl4 complex recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG. Ubiquitylation of CMG in yeast cell extracts is dependent upon lysine 29 of Mcm7, which is the only detectable site of ubiquitylation both in vitro and in vivo (though in vivo other sites can be modified when K29 is mutated). Mutation of K29 abrogates in vitro recruitment of Ufd1-Npl4-Cdc48 to the CMG helicase, supporting a model whereby Ufd1-Npl4 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG at the end of chromosome replication, thereby driving the disassembly reaction.",

These domains can replicate at similar times in all cell types (constitutive) or at cell type-specific times (developmental). Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) has revealed sub-megabase topologically associating domains (TADs), which are the structural counterparts of replication domains. Hi-C also segregates inter-TAD contacts into defined 3D spatial compartments that align precisely to genome-wide replication timing profiles. Determinants of the replication-timing program are re-established during early G1 phase of each cell cycle and lost in G2 phase, but it is not known when TAD structure and inter-TAD contacts are re-established after their elimination during mitosis. Here, we use multiplexed 4C-seq to study dynamic changes in chromatin organization during early G1. We find that both establishment of TADs and their compartmentalization occur during early G1, within the same time frame as establishment of the replication-timing program. Once established, this 3D organization is preserved either after withdrawal into quiescence or for the remainder of interphase including G2 phase, implying 3D structure is not sufficient to maintain replication timing. Finally, we find that developmental domains are less well compartmentalized than constitutive domains and display chromatin properties that distinguish them from early and late constitutive domains.

In mammals, replication timing is cell-type-specific with at least half the genome switching replication timing during development, primarily in units of 400-800 kilobases ('replication domains'), whose positions are preserved in different cell types, conserved between species, and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements. Early and late replication correlate, respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs). Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains. However, TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains, challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale. Moreover, attempts to reconcile TADs and LADs to replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying domain structure. Here we localize boundaries of replication domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timing with developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.",

In this work, we refined TAD definition by further constraining TADs to the optimal separation on global intra-chromosomal interactions. Inspired by this constraint, we developed a novel method, called HiTAD, to detect hierarchical TADs from Hi-C chromatin interactions. HiTAD performs well in domain sensitivity, replicate reproducibility and inter cell-type conservation. With a novel domain-based alignment proposed by us, we defined several types of hierarchical TAD changes which were not systematically studied previously, and subsequently used them to reveal that TADs and sub-TADs differed statistically in correlating chromosomal compartment, replication timing and gene transcription. Finally, our work also has the implication that the refinement of TAD definition could be achieved by only utilizing chromatin interactions, at least in part. HiTAD is freely available online.",

In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere.

Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation.

Despite the status of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as arguably the most well-studied model eukaryote, we still do not have a full catalog or understanding of all its genes. In order to interrogate the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae for low abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts, we deleted elements of the RNA degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative abundance of such transcripts. We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays and ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify, map, and validate unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants relative to wild-type cells. We identified 365 currently unannotated transcripts, the majority presumably representing low abundance or short-lived RNAs, of which 185 are previously unknown and unique to this study. It is likely that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others may be novel functional transcripts. Of the 185 transcripts we identified as novel to our study, greater than 80 percent come from regions of the genome that have lower conservation scores amongst closely related yeast species than 85 percent of the verified ORFs in S. cerevisiae.

These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs). One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of SUTs and CUTs with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function. Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of SUTs and CUTs can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated RNAs or their generation itself. So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including SUTs and CUTs has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome-wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both SUTs and CUTs display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) associated with the promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from NFRs at the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from NFRs associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification.",

These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP complexes. Although CUT degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of CUTs are unknown. Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of CUTs in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional CUTs and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An RNA fraction highly enriched in CUTs was analysed by a 3' Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new CUTs with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels.",

Here, we report that the fission yeast CENP-B homolog Abp1 plays an important role in preventing pervasive transcription. We show that loss of abp1 results in the accumulation of CUTs, which are targeted for degradation by the exosome pathway. These CUTs originate from different types of genomic features, but the highest increase corresponds to Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats, where they map along the entire elements. In the absence of abp1, increased RNAPII-Ser5P occupancy is observed throughout the Tf2 coding region and, unexpectedly, RNAPII-Ser5P is enriched at rDNA repeats. Loss of abp1 also results in Tf2 derepression and increased nucleolus size. Altogether these results suggest that Abp1 prevents pervasive RNAPII transcription of repetitive DNA elements (i.e., Tf2 and rDNA repeats) from internal cryptic sites.",

Analogously, the compact yeast genome encodes for diverse sources of information such as overlapping coding and non-coding transcripts, and protein-binding sites on the two complementary DNA strands. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. They are always depleted in the sense direction of protein-coding genes, thus avoiding degradation of the transcript. However in the antisense direction, predicted binding sites occur at high frequencies in genes with overlapping unstable ncRNAs (CUTs), so limiting the availability of non-functional transcripts. In contrast they are depleted in genes with overlapping stable ncRNAs (SUTs), presumably to avoid degrading the non-coding transcript. The protein-coding genes maintain similar amino-acid contents, but they display distinct codon usages so that Nrd1 and Nab3-binding sites can arise at differing frequencies in antisense depending on the overlapping transcript type. Our study demonstrates how yeast has evolved to encode multiple layers of information-protein-coding genes in one strand and the relative chance of degrading antisense RNA in the other strand-in the same regions of a compact genome.",

It is highly debated whether CUT transcription has a functional role in the cell or whether CUTs represent noise in the yeast transcriptome. We sought to ascertain the extent of conserved CUT expression across a variety of Saccharomyces yeast strains to further understand and characterize the nature of CUT expression. We sequenced the WT and rrp6\u0394 transcriptomes of three S.cerevisiae strains: S288c, \u03a31278b, JAY291 and the S.paradoxus strain N17 and utilized a hidden Markov model to annotate CUTs in these four strains. Utilizing a four-way genomic alignment we identified a large population of CUTs with conserved syntenic expression across all four strains. By identifying configurations of gene-CUT pairs, where CUT expression originates from the gene 5' or 3' nucleosome free region, we observed distinct gene expression trends specific to these configurations which were most prevalent in the presence of conserved CUT expression. Divergent pairs correlate with higher expression of genes, and convergent pairs correlate with reduced gene expression. Our RNA-seq based method has greatly expanded upon previous CUT annotations in S.cerevisiae underscoring the extensive and pervasive nature of unstable transcription. Furthermore we provide the first assessment of conserved CUT expression in yeast and globally demonstrate possible modes of CUT-based regulation of gene expression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21826286": "Non-coding transcripts originating from bidirectional promoters have been reported in a wide range of organisms. In yeast, these divergent transcripts can be subdivided into two classes. Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs) because they are terminated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. This is the same processing pathway used by yeast snoRNAs. Whereas CUTs are only easily observed in cells lacking the Rrp6 or Rrp47 subunits of the nuclear exosome, Stable Uncharacterized Transcripts (SUTs) are present even in wild-type cells. Here we show that SUTs are partially susceptible to the nuclear exosome, but are primarily degraded by cytoplasmic 5' to 3' degradation and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Therefore, SUTs may be processed similarly to mRNAs. Surprisingly, both CUTs and SUTs were found to produce 3' extended species that were also subject to cytoplasmic degradation. The functions, if any, of these extended CUTs and SUTs are unknown, but their discovery suggests that yeasts generate transcripts reminiscent of long non-coding RNAs found in higher eukaryotes.",

CUTs are widespread and probably represent the largest share of hidden transcription in the yeast genome. Similarly to small nucleolar and small nuclear RNAs, transcription of CUT-encoding genes is terminated by the Nrd1 complex pathway. We show here that this termination mode and ensuing CUTs degradation crucially depend on the position of RNA polymerase II relative to the transcription start site. Notably, position sensing correlates with the phosphorylation status of the polymerase C-terminal domain (CTD). The Nrd1 complex is recruited to chromatin via interactions with both the nascent RNA and the CTD, but a permissive phosphorylation status of the latter is absolutely required for efficient transcription termination. We discuss the mechanism underlying the regulation of coexisting cryptic and mRNA-productive transcription.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25680078": "The exosome and its nuclear specific subunit Rrp6 form a 3'-5' exonuclease complex that regulates diverse aspects of RNA biology including 3' end processing and degradation of a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and unstable transcripts. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (&lt;1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism. NNS-dependent termination is coupled to RNA 3' end processing and/or degradation by the Rrp6/exosome in yeast. Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of ncRNA transcripts including CUTs. To determine the role of Rrp6 in NNS termination globally, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on total RNA and perform ChIP-exo analysis of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) localization. Deletion of RRP6 promotes hyper-elongation of multiple NNS-dependent transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' RNA ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in RNAPII termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known NNS targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at CUTs. Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the NNS complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end RNA processing and/or degradation at specific targets.",

Grg4 was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells.

We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins.

Antifibrotic potency and associated mechanisms were studied ex vivo, using both healthy and cirrhotic human precision-cut liver slices. Fibrosis-related parameters, both transcriptional and translational level, were assessed after treatment with galunisertib. Galunisertib showed a prominent antifibrotic potency.

There are several pharmacological approaches to block TGF-\u03b2 signaling, such as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, antisense oligonucleotides, and small molecule inhibitors. Galunisertib (LY2157299 monohydrate) is an oral small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor I kinase that specifically downregulates the phosphorylation of SMAD2, abrogating activation of the canonical pathway.

Galunisertib is being investigated either as monotherapy or in combination with standard antitumor regimens (including nivolumab) in patients with cancer with high unmet medical needs such as glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The present review summarizes the past and current experiences with different pharmacological treatments that enabled galunisertib to be investigated in patients.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of galunisertib on taurocholate (TAC)-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats, and the role of TGF-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. AP was induced by infusion of TAC into the pancreatic duct of Sprague-Dawley male rats (n=30). The rats (220\u00b150 g) were administered galunisertib intragastrically [75 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7day-1 for 2 days (0 and 24 h)]. Serum IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, amylase (AMY), lipase (LIP), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were measured by ELISA. NF-\u03baB activity was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA); NF-\u03baBp65 and TGF-\u03b21 proteins, as well as TGF-\u03b2RI and p-Smad2/3 proteins, were detected by western blot assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. H&amp;E staining was used to evaluate the histopathological alterations of the pancreas. Galunisertib treatment attenuated the severity of AP and decreased the pancreatic histological score. In addition, number of apoptotic cells were significantly increased in the galunisertib-treated group (16.38\u00b12.26) than in the AP group (8.14\u00b11.27) and sham-operated group (1.82\u00b10.73; P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). Galunisertib decreased the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2RI and p-Smad2/3 and inhibited NF-\u03baB activation and p65 translocation compared with the sham-operated group. Furthermore, serum IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, AMY and LIP levels and tissue MPO activity were significantly decreased in the galunisertib-treated group.

Here we randomized the 12-nucleotide larger loop (L-loop) of a well characterized coligo and found unexpectedly that in vitro transcription by FLAG-Pol III was not significantly affected. This observation allowed us to test the variable of coligo L-loop size separately from the variable of its sequence. Transcription efficiency increased with L-loop size from 3 to 12 nucleotides of randomized sequence, and the smallest loop forced initiation to move into the stem region. To test further the need for any specific sequence we compared seven nucleotide L-loops composed of random, abasic and abasic-acyclic nucleotides, and all supported transcription by Pol III. Transcription of a series of coligos containing twelve contiguous randomized nucleotides placed at different locations within the coligo structure provided further evidence that the stem-loop junction structure is important for precise initiation. Nearly the same transcript pattern was formed in vitro by Pol III from yeast and human cells. Overall, these experiments support structure, rather than L-loop sequence, as the major determinant of coligo transcription initiation by Pol III.",

We previously found evidence that circularized oligodeoxynucleotides (coligos) containing certain sequences and secondary structures can template the synthesis of small RNA by RNA polymerase III in vitro and in human cells. By using immunoprecipitated RNA polymerase III we now report corroborating evidence that this enzyme is the sole polymerase responsible for coligo transcription. The immobilized polymerase enabled experiments showing that coligo transcripts can be formed through transcription termination without subsequent 3' end trimming. To better define the determinants of productive transcription, a structure-activity relationship study was performed using over 20 new coligos. The results show that unpaired nucleotides in the coligo stem facilitate circumtranscription, but also that internal loops and bulges should be kept small to avoid secondary transcription initiation sites. A polymerase termination sequence embedded in the double-stranded region of a hairpin-encoding coligo stem can antagonize transcription. Using lessons learned from new and old coligos, we demonstrate how to convert poorly transcribed coligos into productive templates. Our findings support the possibility that coligos may prove useful as chemically synthesized vectors for the ectopic expression of small RNA in human cells.",

While increasingly sophisticated immunotherapy targeting soluble and aggregated brain amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) continues to dominate clinical research in AD, a deeper understanding of A\u03b2 physiology has led to the recognition of distinct neuronal signaling pathways linking A\u03b2 to synaptotoxicity and neurodegeneration and to new targets for therapeutic intervention. Identifying specific signaling pathways involving A\u03b2 has allowed for the development of more precise therapeutic interventions targeting the most relevant molecular mechanisms leading to AD. In this review, I highlight the discovery of cellular prion protein as a high-affinity receptor for A\u03b2 oligomers, and the downstream signaling pathway elucidated to date, converging on nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn. I discuss preclinical studies targeting Fyn as a therapeutic intervention in AD and our recent experience with the safety, tolerability, and cerebrospinal fluid penetration of the Src family kinase inhibitor saracatinib in patients with AD. Fyn is an attractive target for AD therapeutics, not only based on its activation by A\u03b2 via cellular prion protein but also due to its known interaction with tau, uniquely linking the two key pathologies in AD. Fyn is also a challenging target, with broad expression throughout the body and significant homology with other members of the Src family kinases, which may lead to unintended off-target effects. A phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with AD is currently under way, providing critical first data on the potential effectiveness of targeting Fyn in AD.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28420443": "Studies in vivo and in vitro have suggested that the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathogenesis is initiated by an interaction between the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) and amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2o). This PrP<sup>C</sup>-A\u03b2o complex activates Fyn kinase which, in turn, hyperphosphorylates tau (P-Tau) resulting in synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. AD transgenic mice lacking PrP<sup>C</sup> accumulate A\u03b2, but show normal survival and no loss of spatial learning and memory suggesting that PrP<sup>C</sup> functions downstream of A\u03b2o production but upstream of intracellular toxicity within neurons. Since AD and traumatic brain injury (TBI)-linked chronic traumatic encephalopathy are tauopathies, we examined whether similar mechanistic pathways are responsible for both AD and TBI pathophysiologies. Using transgenic mice expressing different levels of PrP<sup>C</sup>, our studies investigated the influence and necessity of PrP<sup>C</sup> on biomarker (total-tau [T-Tau], P-Tau, GFAP) levels in brain and blood as measured biochemically following severe TBI in the form of severe closed head injury (sCHI). We found that following sCHI, increasing levels of T-Tau and P-Tau in the brain were associated with the PrP<sup>C</sup> expression levels. A similar relationship between PrP<sup>C</sup> expression and P-Tau levels following sCHI were found in blood in the absence of significant T-Tau changes. This effect was not seen with GFAP which increased within 24 h following sCHI and progressively decreased by the 7 day time point regardless of the PrP<sup>C</sup> expression levels. Changes in the levels of all biomarkers were independent of gender. We further enhanced and expanded the quantitation of brain biomarkers with correlative studies using immunohisochemistry. We also demonstrate that a TBI-induced calpain hyperactivation is not required for the generation of P-Tau. A relationship was demonstrated between the presence/absence of PrP<sup>C</sup>, the levels of P-Tau and cognitive dysfunction. Our studies suggest that PrP<sup>C</sup> is important in mediating TBI related pathology.",

Here, we examine the role of the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control of the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12 becomes activated and reduces SUT1/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in increased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. Higher ergosterol levels in combination with the proteins Fhn1, Npr1 and Prr2 would then mediate the transition to filamentous growth.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24163365": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE) common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors, Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The 7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2 must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs. Therefore, targeting these specific sites for antifungal therapy represents a novel approach to treat systemic fungal infections.",

However, in yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans sterol synthesis is instead regulated by Upc2, an unrelated transcription factor with a Gal4-type zinc finger. The SREBPs in S. cerevisiae (Hms1) and C. albicans (Cph2) have lost a domain, are not major regulators of sterol synthesis, and instead regulate filamentous growth. We report here that rewiring of the sterol regulon, with Upc2 taking over from SREBP, likely occurred in the common ancestor of all Saccharomycotina. Yarrowia lipolytica, a deep-branching species, is the only genome known to contain intact and full-length orthologs of both SREBP (Sre1) and Upc2. Deleting YlUPC2, but not YlSRE1, confers susceptibility to azole drugs. Sterol levels are significantly reduced in the YlUPC2 deletion. RNA-seq analysis shows that hypoxic regulation of sterol synthesis genes in Y. lipolytica is predominantly mediated by Upc2. However, YlSre1 still retains a role in hypoxic regulation; growth of Y. lipolytica in hypoxic conditions is reduced in a Ylupc2 deletion and is abolished in a Ylsre1/Ylupc2 double deletion, and YlSre1 regulates sterol gene expression during hypoxia adaptation. We show that YlSRE1, and to a lesser extent YlUPC2, are required for switching from yeast to filamentous growth in hypoxia. Sre1 appears to have an ancestral role in the regulation of filamentation, which became decoupled from its role in sterol gene regulation by the arrival of Upc2 in the Saccharomycotina.",

This response to exogenous cholesterol was not mediated at the transcriptional level, since apoE mRNA levels were constant under all culture conditions. Concomitant with the increase in secretion following cholesterol uptake by upc2 strains, approximately 5% of secreted apoE was associated with lipid; polar and non-polar lipids were detected in this lipoprotein fraction. Intracellular degradation of apoE in non-secreting strains of yeast was minimized by the presence of null mutations in both vacuolar proteases with non-specific activity (pep4) and a Golgi endopeptidase with specificity for paired basic residues (kex2). The approach of expressing human apolipoproteins in yeast may identify factors that mediate lipoprotein biosynthesis in higher cells.

Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1 results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12 deletion lowers basal PRM1 expression, whereas STE12 overexpression strongly increases PRM1 levels. This regulation of PRM1 transcription is mediated through three Ste12-binding sites in the PRM1 promoter. Simultaneous deletion of ECM22 and UPC2 as well as mutation of the three Ste12-binding sites in the PRM1 promoter completely abolishes basal and pheromone-induced PRM1 expression, indicating that Ste12 and Ecm22/Upc2 control PRM1 transcription through distinct pathways. In summary, we propose a novel mechanism for budding yeast mating. We suggest that Ecm22 and Upc2 regulate mating through the induction of the mating genes PRM1 and PRM4.",

A specific mutant, upc2-1, of the predicted transcriptional activator UPC2 (YDR213w) has been recognized as a strain that allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2. First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus yeast sterol.",

ERG11 encodes lanosterol demethylase, the target enzyme of this antifungal class. Overexpression of UPC2 reduces azole susceptibility, whereas its disruption results in hypersusceptibility to azoles and reduced accumulation of exogenous sterols. Overexpression of ERG11 leads to the increased production of lanosterol demethylase, which contributes to azole resistance in clinical isolates of C. albicans, but the mechanism for this has yet to be determined. Using genome-wide gene expression profiling, we found UPC2 and other genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis to be coordinately upregulated with ERG11 in a fluconazole-resistant clinical isolate compared with a matched susceptible isolate from the same patient. Sequence analysis of the UPC2 alleles of these isolates revealed that the resistant isolate contained a single-nucleotide substitution in one UPC2 allele that resulted in a G648D exchange in the encoded protein. Introduction of the mutated allele into a drug-susceptible strain resulted in constitutive upregulation of ERG11 and increased resistance to fluconazole. By comparing the gene expression profiles of the fluconazole-resistant isolate and of strains carrying wild-type and mutated UPC2 alleles, we identified target genes that are controlled by Upc2p. Here we show for the first time that a gain-of-function mutation in UPC2 leads to the increased expression of ERG11 and imparts resistance to fluconazole in clinical isolates of C. albicans.",

These cells likely possess alternative UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms. Here, we identify a secreted enzyme, peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1), that is enriched in UCP1(+) versus UCP1(-) adipocytes. We demonstrate that PM20D1 is a bidirectional enzyme in vitro, catalyzing both the condensation of fatty acids and amino acids to generate N-acyl amino acids and also the reverse hydrolytic reaction. N-acyl amino acids directly bind mitochondria and function as endogenous uncouplers of UCP1-independent respiration. Mice with increased circulating PM20D1 have augmented respiration and increased N-acyl amino acids in blood. Lastly, administration of N-acyl amino acids to mice improves glucose homeostasis and increases energy expenditure. These data identify an enzymatic node and a family of metabolites that regulate energy homeostasis. This pathway might be useful for treating obesity and associated disorders.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378359": "Until recently, the mechanism of adaptive thermogenesis was ascribed to the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown and beige adipocytes. UCP1 is known to catalyze a proton leak of the inner mitochondrial membrane, resulting in uncoupled oxidative metabolism with no production of adenosine triphosphate and increased energy expenditure. Thus increasing brown and beige adipose tissue with augmented UCP1 expression is a viable target for obesity-related disorders. Recent work demonstrates an UCP1-independent pathway to uncouple mitochondrial respiration. A secreted enzyme, PM20D1, enriched in UCP1+ adipocytes, exhibits catalytic and hydrolytic activity to reversibly form N-acyl amino acids. N-acyl amino acids act as endogenous uncouplers of mitochondrial respiration at physiological concentrations. Administration of PM20D1 or its products, N-acyl amino acids, to diet-induced obese mice improves glucose tolerance by increasing energy expenditure. In short-term studies, treated animals exhibit no toxicity while experiencing 10% weight loss primarily of adipose tissue. Further study of this metabolic pathway may identify novel therapies for diabesity, the disease state associated with diabetes and obesity.",

Although discussed in the literature well over a century ago, synesthesia slipped out of the scientific spotlight for decades because of the difficulty in verifying and quantifying private perceptual experiences. In recent years, the study of synesthesia has enjoyed a renaissance due to the introduction of tests that demonstrate the reality of the condition, its automatic and involuntary nature, and its measurable perceptual consequences. However, while several research groups now study synesthesia, there is no single protocol for comparing, contrasting and pooling synesthetic subjects across these groups. There is no standard battery of tests, no quantifiable scoring system, and no standard phrasing of questions. Additionally, the tests that exist offer no means for data comparison. To remedy this deficit we have devised the Synesthesia Battery. This unified collection of tests is freely accessible online (http://www.synesthete.org). It consists of a questionnaire and several online software programs, and test results are immediately available for use by synesthetes and invited researchers. Performance on the tests is quantified with a standard scoring system. We introduce several novel tests here, and offer the software for running the tests. By presenting standardized procedures for testing and comparing subjects, this endeavor hopes to speed scientific progress in synesthesia research.",

However, the ability to diagnose synaesthesia using this method depends on several factors that have not been directly contrasted. These include the type of colour space used (e.g., RGB, HSV, CIELUV, CIELAB) and different measures of consistency (e.g., city block and Euclidean distance in colour space). This study aims to find the most reliable way of diagnosing grapheme-colour synaesthesia based on maximising sensitivity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true synaesthetes) and specificity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true non-synaesthetes). We show, applying ROC (receiver operating characteristics) to binary classification of a large sample of self-declared synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, that the consistency criterion (i.e., cut-off value) for diagnosing synaesthesia is considerably higher than the current standard in the field. We also show that methods based on perceptual CIELUV and CIELAB colour models (rather than RGB and HSV colour representations) and Euclidean distances offer an even greater sensitivity and specificity than most currently used measures. Together, these findings offer improved heuristics for the behavioural assessment of grapheme-colour synaesthesia.",

Because language processing is strongly left-lateralized in most individuals, we hypothesized that grapheme-color synesthesia could be left-lateralized as well. We used synesthetic versions of the Stroop test with colored letters and numbers presented either in the right or the left visual field of thirty-four synesthetes. Interference by synesthetic colors was stronger for stimuli in the right hemifield (first experiment, color naming task). Synesthetes were also faster in the right hemifield when naming the synesthetic color of graphemes (second experiment). Overall, the lateralization effect was 7 ms (the 95% confidence interval was [1.5 12] ms), a delay compatible with an additional callosal transfer for stimuli presented in the left hemifield. Though weak, this effect suggests that the association of synesthetic colors to graphemes may be preferentially processed in the left hemisphere. We speculate that this left-lateralization could be a landmark of synesthetic grapheme-color associations, if not found for color associations learnt by non-synesthete adults.",

In humans, elevated GDF15 correlates with weight loss, and the administration of GDF15 to mice with obesity reduces body weight, at least in part, by decreasing food intake. The mechanisms through which GDF15 reduces body weight remain poorly understood, because the cognate receptor for GDF15 is unknown. Here we show that recombinant GDF15 induces weight loss in mice fed a high-fat diet and in nonhuman primates with spontaneous obesity. Furthermore, we find that GDF15 binds with high affinity to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL), a distant relative of receptors for a distinct class of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands. Gfral is expressed in neurons of the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract in mice and humans, and genetic deletion of the receptor abrogates the ability of GDF15 to decrease food intake and body weight in mice. In addition, diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are exacerbated in GFRAL-deficient mice, suggesting a homeostatic role for this receptor in metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate that GDF15-induced cell signaling requires the interaction of GFRAL with the coreceptor RET. Our data identify GFRAL as a new regulator of body weight and as the bona fide receptor mediating the metabolic effects of GDF15, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of GDF15 as a potential pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity.",

However, the expression patterns and functions of circRNAs in human diseases are not well understood. Computationally identifying circRNAs from total RNA-seq data is a primary step in studying their expression pattern and biological roles. In this work, we have developed a computational pipeline named UROBORUS to detect circRNAs in total RNA-seq data. By applying UROBORUS to RNA-seq data from 46 gliomas and normal brain samples, we detected thousands of circRNAs supported by at least two read counts, followed by successful experimental validation on 24 circRNAs from the randomly selected 27 circRNAs. UROBORUS is an efficient tool that can detect circRNAs with low expression levels in total RNA-seq without RNase R treatment. The circRNAs expression profiling revealed more than 476 circular RNAs differentially expressed in control brain tissues and gliomas. Together with parental gene expression, we found that circRNA and its parental gene have diversified expression patterns in gliomas and control brain tissues.

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01697072\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01697072</a>. Between Nov 7, 2012, and Nov 21, 2014, 609 patients were randomly assigned to rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (rilotumumab group; n=304) or placebo plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (placebo group; n=305). Study treatment was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee found a higher number of deaths in the rilotumumab group than in the placebo group; all patients in the rilotumumab group subsequently discontinued all study treatment. Median follow-up was 7\u00b77 months (IQR 3\u00b76-12\u00b70) for patients in the rilotumumab group and 9\u00b74 months (5\u00b73-13\u00b71) for patients in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 8\u00b78 months (95% CI 7\u00b77-10\u00b72) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10\u00b77 months (9\u00b76-12\u00b74) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1\u00b734, 95% CI 1\u00b710-1\u00b763; p=0\u00b7003). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the rilotumumab and placebo groups were neutropenia (86 [29%] of 298 patients vs 97 [32%] of 299 patients), anaemia (37 [12%] vs 43 [14%]), and fatigue (30 [10%] vs 35 [12%]). The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the rilotumumab and placebo groups (142 [48%] vs 149 [50%]). More deaths due to adverse events occurred in the rilotumumab group than the placebo group (42 [14%] vs 31 [10%]). In the rilotumumab group, 33 (11%) of 298 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and nine (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. In the placebo group, 23 (8%) of 299 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and eight (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression.

We found that rilotumumab exhibited linear and time-invariant kinetics over a dose range of 0.5-20 mg/kg. Typical systemic clearance and central volume of distribution were 0.184 L/day and 3.56 L, respectively.

Here, we quantitatively characterized the longitudinal exposure-response [tumor growth (TG) and overall survival (OS)] relationship for rilotumumab. Rilotumumab concentrations, tumor sizes, and survival time from the phase II study were pooled to develop a longitudinal exposure versus TG model and parametric OS model that explored predictive/prognostic/treatment effects (MET expression, rilotumumab exposure, relative tumor size). Model evaluation included visual predictive checks, nonparametric bootstrap, and normalized prediction distribution errors. Simulations were undertaken to predict the relationship between rilotumumab dose and OS. Rilotumumab exhibited linear time-independent pharmacokinetics not affected by MET expression. The TG model adequately described tumor size across arms. A Weibull distribution best described OS. Rilotumumab exposure and change in tumor size from baseline at week 24 were predictive of OS. MET-positive patients showed shorter survival and responded better to rilotumumab than MET-negative patients. Simulations predicted a median (95% confidence interval) HR of 0.38 (0.18-0.60) in MET-positive patients treated with 15 mg/kg rilotumumab Q3W.

Recovery from backtracks can occur by 1D diffusion or cleavage of backtracked RNA, but how polymerases make this choice is unknown. Here, we use single-molecule optical tweezers experiments and stochastic theory to show that the choice of a backtrack recovery mechanism is determined by a kinetic competition between 1D diffusion and RNA cleavage. Notably, RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and Pol II recover from shallow backtracks by 1D diffusion, use RNA cleavage to recover from intermediary depths, and are unable to recover from extensive backtracks. Furthermore, Pol I and Pol II use distinct mechanisms to avoid nonrecoverable backtracking. Pol I is protected by its subunit A12.2, which decreases the rate of 1D diffusion and enables transcript cleavage up to 20 nt. In contrast, Pol II is fully protected through association with the cleavage stimulatory factor TFIIS, which enables rapid recovery from any depth by RNA cleavage. Taken together, we identify distinct backtrack recovery strategies of Pol I and Pol II, shedding light on the evolution of cellular functions of these key enzymes.",

Mutants were chosen for analysis based on their ability to render yeast cells sensitive to growth on medium containing 6-azauracil. RNA polymerase II purified from three different 6-azauracil-sensitive yeast strains displayed increased arrest at well characterized arrest sites in vitro. The extent of this defect did not correlate with sensitivity to growth in the presence of 6-azauracil. The most severe effect resulted from mutation rpb2 10 (P1018S), which occurs in region H, a domain highly conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases that is associated with nucleotide binding. The average elongation rate of this mutant enzyme is also slower than wild type. We suggest that the slowed elongation rate and an increase in dwell time of elongating pol II leads to rpb2 10's arrest-prone phenotype. This mutant enzyme can respond to SII for transcriptional read-through and carry out SII-activated nascent RNA cleavage.",

It was suggested that these mutations affect the functional interaction between RNAPII and transcription-elongation factor TFIIS because the 6AU-sensitive phenotype of the mutant strains was similar to that of a strain defective in the production of TFIIS and can be suppressed by increasing the dosage of the yeast TFIIS-encoding gene, PPR2, RNAPIIs were purified and characterized from two independent 6AU-sensitive yeast mutants and from wild-type (wt) cells. In vitro, in the absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent transcription, readthrough or cleavage. However, stimulation of the ability of the mutant RNAPIIs to cleave nascent RNA and to read through intrinsic arrest sites was observed at TFIIS:RNAPII molar ratios greater than 600:1. Consistent with these findings, the binding affinity of the mutant polymerases for TFIIS was found to be reduced by more than 50-fold compared with that of the wt enzyme. These studies demonstrate that TFIIS has an important role in the regulation of transcription by yeast RNAPII and identify a possible binding site for TFIIS on RNAPII.",

These complexes resumed elongation in situ when gel slices were incubated with magnesium and NTPs. Elongation occurred in the absence of pyrophosphate, suggesting that the blocking 3'-OMeGMP residue was removed via a novel pathway. We show that purified elongation complexes contain an intrinsic nuclease activity that shortens nascent RNA from the 3'-end. RNA cleavage was absolutely dependent on a divalent cation and was stimulated by CTP. The initial 5' cleavage product remained associated with the ternary complex and could be elongated in the presence of NTPs. Multiple stepwise cleavages generated progressively shorter chains. Purified ternary complexes containing 3'-OH-terminated RNAs also displayed nuclease activity. Involvement of the vaccinia RNA polymerase subunit rpo30 in the transcript-shortening reaction is suggested based on sequence similarity of rpo30 to mammalian protein SII (TFIIS), an extrinsic transcription factor required for nascent RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D.

A mutant Pol III, heterocomplemented with Schizosaccharomyces pombe C11, was affected in transcription termination in vivo. A purified form of the enzyme (Pol III Delta), deprived of C11 subunit, initiated properly but ignored pause sites and was defective in termination. Remarkably, Pol III Delta lacked the intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of complete Pol III. In vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that Pol III RNA cleavage activity is mediated by C11. Mutagenesis in C11 of two conserved residues, which are critical for the TFIIS-dependent cleavage activity of Pol II, is lethal. Immunoelectron microscopy data suggested that C11 is localized on the mobile thumb-like stalk of the polymerase. We propose that C11 allows the enzyme to switch between an RNA elongation and RNA cleavage mode and that the essential role of the Pol III RNA cleavage activity is to remove the kinetic barriers to the termination process. The integration of TFIIS function into a specific Pol III subunit may stem from the opposite requirements of Pol III and Pol II in terms of transcript length and termination efficiency.",

Here we used lysine-lysine crosslinking, mass spectrometry (MS) and modeling based on five crystal structures, to extend the previous homology model of the Pol I core, to confirm the location of A14/43 and to position A12.2 and A49/34.5 on the core. In the resulting model of Pol I, the C-terminal ribbon (C-ribbon) domain of A12.2 reaches the active site via the polymerase pore, like the C-ribbon of the Pol II cleavage factor TFIIS, explaining why the intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of Pol I is strong, in contrast to the weak cleavage activity of Pol II. The A49/34.5 dimerization module resides on the polymerase lobe, like TFIIF, whereas the A49 tWH domain resides above the cleft, resembling parts of TFIIE.

The amino and carboxyl regions of C11 are homologous to domains of the pol II subunit Rpb9p, and the pol II elongation and RNA cleavage factor, TFIIS, respectively. We isolated C11 mutants from Schizosaccharomyces pombe that cause pol III to readthrough terminators in vivo. Mutant RNA confirmed the presence of terminator readthrough transcripts. A predominant mutation site, F32, resides in the C11 Rpb9-like domain. Another mutagenic approach confirmed the F32 mutation and also isolated I34 and Y30 mutants. Modeling Y30, F32 and I34 of C11 in available cryoEM pol III structures predicts a hydrophobic patch that may interface with C53/37. Another termination mutant, Rpc2-T455I, appears to reside internally, near the RNA-DNA hybrid.

The originally defined yeast Pol III transcriptome appears to be expanding owing to the application of new methods. Also, several factors required for assembly and nuclear import of Pol III complex have been identified recently. Models of Pol III based on cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of distinct Pol III conformations reveal unique features distinguishing Pol III from other polymerases. Novel concepts concerning Pol III functioning involve recruitment of general Pol III-specific transcription factors and distinctive mechanisms of transcription initiation, elongation and termination. Despite the short length of Pol III transcription units, mapping of transcriptionally active Pol III with nucleotide resolution has revealed strikingly uneven polymerase distribution along all genes. This may be related, at least in part, to the transcription factors bound at the internal promoter regions. Pol III uses also a specific negative regulator, Maf1, which binds to polymerase under stress conditions; however, a subset of Pol III genes is not controlled by Maf1. Among other RNA polymerases, Pol III machinery represents unique features related to a short transcript length and high transcription efficiency.",

To define the Pol III transcriptome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation using subunits of Pol III, TFIIIB and TFIIIC. Virtually all of the predicted targets of Pol III, as well as several novel candidates, were occupied by Pol III machinery. Interestingly, TATA box-binding protein occupancy was greater at Pol III targets than virtually all Pol II targets, and the highly occupied Pol II targets are generally strongly transcribed. The temporal relationships between factor occupancy and gene activity were then investigated at selected targets. Nutrient deprivation rapidly reduced both Pol III transcription and Pol III occupancy of both a tRNA gene and RPR1. In contrast, TFIIIB remained bound, suggesting that TFIIIB release is not a critical aspect of the onset of repression. Remarkably, TFIIIC occupancy increased dramatically during repression. Nutrient addition generally reestablished transcription and initial occupancy levels. Our results are consistent with active Pol III displacing TFIIIC, and with inactivation/release of Pol III enabling TFIIIC to bind, marking targets for later activation.

Recently, a ubiquitin-specific protease enzyme (named HAUSP) and a ubiquitin-homology family protein (PIC1) have been found associated with ND10. HAUSP binds strongly to Vmw110, a herpesvirus regulatory protein which has the ability to disrupt ND10, while PIC1 was identified as a protein which interacts with PML, the prototype ND10 protein. We have investigated the role of ubiquitin-related pathways in the mechanism of ND10 disruption by Vmw110 and the effect of virus infection on PML stability. The results show that the disruption of ND10 during virus infection correlates with the loss of several PML isoforms and this process is dependent on active proteasomes. The PML isoforms that are most sensitive to virus infection correspond closely to those which have recently been identified as being covalently conjugated to PIC1. In addition, a large number of PIC1-protein conjugates can be detected following transfection of a PIC1 expression plasmid, and many of these are also eliminated in a Vmw110-dependent manner during virus infection. These observations provide a biochemical mechanism to explain the observed effects of Vmw110 on ND10 and suggest a simple yet powerful mechanism by which Vmw110 might function during virus infection.",

Although the viral E6 protein is known to be essential for driving malignant progression of HPV-infected cells, there are still many uncertainties about its mode of action. In this study, we have analysed the intracellular distribution of the E6 oncoproteins from the high-risk HPV-18 and the low-risk HPV-11. We show that both E6 proteins localize within the nucleus in nuclear bodies that are confocal with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein. Using a panel of different PML isoforms, we demonstrate specific co-localization between the E6 proteins and PML isoforms I-IV, but not with PML isoforms V and VI. We also demonstrate the interaction between E6 and a subset of PML isoforms in vivo. As a consequence of this interaction, the insoluble form of PML IV is destabilized by HPV-18 E6 through a proteasome-dependent pathway. Interestingly, both HPV-11 E6 and HPV-18 E6 can readily overcome PML IV-induced cellular senescence in primary cells.

Promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs, also known as ND10) contribute to host restriction of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication via mechanisms that are counteracted by viral regulatory protein ICP0. ND10 assembly is dependent on PML, which comprises several different isoforms, and depletion of all PML isoforms decreases cellular resistance to ICP0-null mutant HSV-1. We report that individual expression of PML isoforms I and II partially reverses the increase in ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 plaque formation that occurs in PML-depleted cells. This activity of PML isoform I is dependent on SUMO modification, its SUMO interaction motif (SIM), and each element of its TRIM domain. Detailed analysis revealed that the punctate foci formed by individual PML isoforms differ subtly from normal ND10 in terms of composition and/or Sp100 modification. Surprisingly, deletion of the SIM motif from PML isoform I resulted in increased colocalisation with other major ND10 components in cells lacking endogenous PML.

This variability is important for the function of the different PML isoforms. PML NB formation requires the covalent linkage of SUMO to PML. Arsenic trioxide (As\u2082O\u2083) enhances PML SUMOylation leading to an increase in PML NB size and promotes its interaction with RNF4, a poly-SUMO-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for proteasome-mediated PML degradation. Furthermore, the presence of a bona fide SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM) within the C-terminal region of PML seems to be required for recruitment of other SUMOylated proteins within PML NBs. This motif is present in all PML isoforms, except in the nuclear PMLVI and in the cytoplasmic PMLVII. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay in living cells, we found that As\u2082O\u2083 enhanced the SUMOylation and interaction with RNF4 of nuclear PML isoforms (I to VI). In addition, among the nuclear PML isoforms, only the one lacking the SIM sequence, PMLVI, was resistant to As\u2082O\u2083-induced PML degradation. Similarly, mutation of the SIM in PMLIII abrogated its sensitivity to As\u2082O\u2083-induced degradation. PMLVI and PMLIII-SIM mutant still interacted with RNF4. However, their resistance to the degradation process was due to their inability to be polyubiquitinated and to recruit efficiently the 20S core and the \u03b2 regulatory subunit of the 11S complex of the proteasome in PML NBs. Such resistance of PMLVI to As\u2082O\u2083-induced degradation was alleviated by overexpression of RNF4. Our results demonstrate that the SIM of PML is dispensable for PML SUMOylation and interaction with RNF4 but is required for efficient PML ubiquitination, recruitment of proteasome components within NBs and proteasome-dependent degradation of PML in response to As\u2082O\u2083.",

However, it has not been investigated whether any of the C-terminal variants of PML may contribute to PML body assembly. Here we report that the unique C-terminal domains of PML-II and PML-V can target to PML-NBs independent of their N-terminal region. Strikingly, both domains can form nuclear bodies in the absence of endogenous PML. The C-terminal domain of PML-II interacts transiently with unknown binding sites at PML nuclear bodies, whereas the C-terminal domain of PML-V exhibits hyperstable binding to PML bodies via homo-dimerization. This strong interaction is mediated by a putative \u03b1-helix in the C terminus of PML-V. Moreover, nuclear bodies assembled from the C-terminal domain of PML-V also recruit additional PML body components, including Daxx and Sp100.

Here, we review the nomenclature and structural organization of the PML isoforms in order to clarify the various designations and classifications found in different databases.

PML-RAR\u03b1 is degraded by the proteasome by a SUMO-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated pathway in response to arsenic treatment, curing the disease. Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region. Using a system in which only a single EYFP-linked PML isoform is expressed, we demonstrate that PMLI, PMLII and PMLVI accumulate in the cytoplasm following arsenic treatment, whereas PMLIII, PMLIV and PMLV do not. 3D structured illumination was used to obtain super-resolution images of PML bodies, revealing spherical shells of PML along with associated SUMO. Arsenic treatment results in dramatic isoform-specific changes to PML body ultrastructure. After extended arsenic treatment most PML isoforms are degraded, leaving SUMO at the core of the nuclear bodies. A high-content imaging assay identifies PMLV as the isoform most readily degraded following arsenic treatment, and PMLIV as relatively resistant to degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that all PML isoforms are modified by SUMO and ubiquitin after arsenic treatment, and by using siRNA, we demonstrate that arsenic-induced degradation of all PML isoforms is dependent on the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4. Intriguingly, depletion of RNF4 results in marked accumulation of PMLV, suggesting that this isoform is an optimal substrate for RNF4. Thus the variable C-terminal domain influences the rate and location of degradation of PML isoforms following arsenic treatment.",

However, the biochemical consequences and oncogenic alterations of PML-associated E1B-55K by SUMO-dependent PML-IV and PML-V interaction have so far remained elusive. We performed mutational analysis to define a PML interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. Our results showed that E1B-55K/PML binding is not required for p53, Mre11 and Daxx interaction. We also observed that E1B-55K lacking subnuclear PML localization because of either PML-IV or PML-V-binding deficiency was no longer capable of mediating E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53, inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or efficiently transforming primary rodent cells. These results together with the observation that E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53 is required for efficient cell transformation, provides evidence for the idea that the SUMO ligase activity of the E1B-55K viral oncoprotein is intimately linked to its growth-promoting oncogenic activities.",

They have the largest nervous systems among the invertebrates and present other striking morphological innovations including camera-like eyes, prehensile arms, a highly derived early embryogenesis and a remarkably sophisticated adaptive colouration system. To investigate the molecular bases of cephalopod brain and body innovations, we sequenced the genome and multiple transcriptomes of the California two-spot octopus, Octopus bimaculoides. We found no evidence for hypothesized whole-genome duplications in the octopus lineage. The core developmental and neuronal gene repertoire of the octopus is broadly similar to that found across invertebrate bilaterians, except for massive expansions in two gene families previously thought to be uniquely enlarged in vertebrates: the protocadherins, which regulate neuronal development, and the C2H2 superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors. Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers and the nervous system. Finally, we found evidence for large-scale genomic rearrangements that are closely associated with transposable element expansions. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems.",

However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This present study also suggests that linkage of editing should be considered in elucidating the functional consequences of RNA editing.",

Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28855414": "RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded by genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.",

Here we describe the rationale and design of the Phase 3 APOLLO study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Eligible patients are 18-85 years old with hATTR amyloidosis, investigator-estimated survival of \u22652 years, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5-130, and polyneuropathy disability score \u2264IIIb. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either intravenous patisiran 0.3 mg/kg or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of patisiran at 18 months based on the difference in the change in modified NIS+7 (a composite measure of motor strength, sensation, reflexes, nerve conduction, and autonomic function) between the patisiran and placebo groups. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of patisiran on Norfolk-Diabetic Neuropathy quality of life questionnaire score, nutritional status (as evaluated by modified body mass index), motor function (as measured by NIS-weakness and timed 10-m walk test), and autonomic symptoms (as measured by the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 questionnaire). Exploratory objectives include assessment of cardiac function and pathologic evaluation to assess nerve fiber innervation and amyloid burden. Safety of patisiran will be assessed throughout the study. APOLLO represents the largest randomized, Phase 3 study to date in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, with endpoints that capture the multisystemic nature of this disease.

Here we show that GDF15 binds specifically to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL) with high affinity, and that GFRAL requires association with the coreceptor RET to elicit intracellular signaling in response to GDF15 stimulation. We also found that GDF15-mediated reductions in food intake and body weight of mice with obesity were abolished in GFRAL-knockout mice. We further found that GFRAL expression was limited to hindbrain neurons and not present in peripheral tissues, which suggests that GDF15-GFRAL-mediated regulation of food intake is by a central mechanism. Lastly, given that GDF15 did not increase energy expenditure in treated mice with obesity, the anti-obesity actions of the cytokine are likely driven primarily by a reduction in food intake.",

Heart valve structure and competence is maintained by heart valve cells through a process of continuous turnover extracellular matrix (ECM). Degenerative (myxomatous) mitral valve disease (DMVD) is an important disease associated with aging in both dogs and humans. DMVD is increasingly regarded as a disease with identifiable signaling mechanisms that control key genes associated with regulation and dysregulation of ECM homeostasis. Initiating stimuli for these signaling pathways have not been fully elucidated but likely include both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Signaling pathways implicated in DMVD include serotonin, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), and heart valve developmental pathways. High circulating serotonin (carcinoid syndrome) and serotoninergic drugs are known to cause valvulopathy that shares pathologic features with DMVD. Recent evidence supports a local serotonin signaling mechanism, possibly triggered by high tensile loading on heart valves. Serotonin initiates TGF\u03b2 signaling, which in turn has been strongly implicated in canine DMVD. Recent evidence suggests that degenerative aortic and mitral valve disease may involve pathologic processes that mimic osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, respectively. These processes may be mediated by developmental pathways shared by heart valves, bone, and cartilage. These pathways include bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling. Other signaling pathways implicated in heart valve disease include Notch, nitric oxide, and angiotensin II. Ultimately, increased understanding of signaling mechanisms could point to therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression.",

This article describes the use of nadolol to treat three pediatric patients with a buccal or genital hemangioma who developed adverse reactions (mainly, irritability and sleep disturbances) or resistance to initial treatment with propranolol. The patients were 10 months, 12 months, and 4 years of age, respectively, when hemangioma treatment was initiated. The results of nadolol therapy were favorable, with involution of lesions and gradual disappearance of propranolol-associated adverse effects occurring in all three cases. As with any use of \u03b2-blocker therapy in a pediatric patient, a cardiac workup is advised before the start of nadolol therapy; blood pressure and heart rate monitoring should be performed at one and two hours after the first dose and continued during dose escalation. Nadolol was an effective alternative to propranolol in three pediatric patients with hemangiomas.",

This multicenter retrospective study describes the efficacy and adverse effects of propranolol in infantile hemangioma. Seventy-one infants with infantile hemangiomas were treated with oral propranolol, 1 mg/kg/12 hours, for at least 12 weeks. A photograph based severity scoring assessment was performed by five observers to evaluate efficacy, utilizing a scoring system of 10 as the original infantile hemangioma before treatment and 0 as completely normal skin. The mean of the five independent measurements was used in the analysis. Propranolol was a rapid and effective treatment for infantile hemangiomas at 4 weeks (p &lt; 0.001), at 8 weeks (p &lt; 0.001 compared to the 4 wks value), at 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.05 compared to the 8 wks value), and thereafter up to 32 weeks (p &lt; 0.01 compared to the 16 wks value). The response of infantile hemangiomas to propranolol was similar regardless of sex, age at onset of treatment, type of involvement (segmental and nonsegmental), facial segments affected, special locations (eyelid, nasal tip, and parotid region), ulceration, and depth of infantile hemangiomas. Very few side effects were reported; mainly agitated sleep in 10 of 71 patients. In the series of patients in this study, oral propranolol 2 mg/kg/day was a well-tolerated and effective treatment for infantile hemangiomas. Prospective studies are needed to establish the exact role of propranolol in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas.",

Clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, and experimental examination of liver function and heart function were performed before treatment. The daily dose of propranolol was increased from 1 mg/kg at the first day to 1.5 mg/kg at the second day, and to 2 mg/kg at the third day. The propranolol was given twice a day. The treatment was lasted for six months. The patients were visited every month. The lesion color was changed after 2-4 days of treatment in all the cases. All the lesions were dramatically improved after one month of treatment. The ulceration were healed, except one case. Until now, complete regression was achieved in 10 cases and marked improvement in 46 cases. Side effects were happened in 3 cases, including one case of abnormal liver function, one case of CK-MB increase and one case of continuous increase of CK-MB, LDH, ALT, GGT. High-dose Propranolol is very effective in the treatment of infantile hemangioma with minor side effects and short disease period.

Propranolol was first used to treat patients with infantile hemangiomas in 2008 and has since gained acceptance as first-line therapy. We review the presentation, course, management and outcomes of all cases of genital infantile hemangiomas managed by propranolol administration at a single institution from April 2010 to July 2014. During the study period 9 patients with genital infantile hemangiomas were referred to our hemangioma treatment clinic. Propranolol was initially administered under careful outpatient monitoring at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily in 8 patients. One patient, a 700 gm premature infant, was started on therapy in the inpatient setting at 0.5 mg/kg daily, given the history of prematurity. All patients underwent successful increase of dose to at least 2 mg/kg for the observation phase after tolerating the starting doses. One patient discontinued propranolol prematurely per parental request due to concern regarding peripheral vasoconstriction. Otherwise, no patient demonstrated significant hypotension, symptomatic bradycardia, hypoglycemia or other major side effect requiring treatment discontinuation. All patients who continued the treatment protocol had excellent response to therapy. Propranolol therapy for genital infantile hemangiomas was successfully initiated and the dosage increased in 9 young children without significant side effects and with marked improvement in all patients who continued on treatment. Propranolol is the only Food and Drug Administration approved therapy for treatment of patients with this vascular anomaly and should be considered first-line therapy for genital infantile hemangiomas.",

Successful treatment with propranolol in western countries has been reported over the past few years. We evaluated the efficacy of propranolol for treating infantile hemangioma in Taiwanese newborns and young infants. Patients below 1 year of age treated with propanolol between November 2009 and March 2011 were enrolled. Demographic data, clinical features, imaging findings, treatment regimens of propranolol, and outcome were investigated. Thirteen patients were treated with propranolol at a dose of 2-3 mg/kg/day. Seven (53.8%) patients had solitary hemangioma and six had multiple ones. The indications for treatment were risk of local event in nine patients, functional risk in four, local complication in one, and life-threatening complication in one. The median age for starting propranolol was 4 months (range: 1-11 months). Responses to propranolol, such as decolorization, regression in tumor size, or improvement of hemangioma-associated complications were observed in all patients within 1-2 weeks after treatment. Propranolol-associated adverse effects occurred in two patients. One infant had occasional tachypnea, and the other had occasional pale-looking appearance. The symptoms resolved after dosage tapering. Propranolol may be a promising therapeutic modality for infantile hemangioma.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of propranolol in 12 infants with hemangioma. Twelve infants (9 girls) with a median age of 4.5 months were included in the study. All of the patients in the study group received short-term (1-9 weeks, median: 4 weeks) systemic corticosteroids as a first-line therapy. All patients received propranolol 2 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses. They were treated in an inpatient setting for the first 72 hours of the treatment. Vital signs, blood pressure and blood glucose were monitored. Propranolol treatment was given for 4-9 months (median: 5 months). In the study group, regression rate of the mean dimension of the lesion was 38% +/- 15 (range 15%-50, median 45%) at the 2nd month of therapy. Over 9 months, which was the maximum follow-up period, the regression rate of the mean dimension of the lesion was 55% +/- 31 (range 20%-80, median 50%). One patient had transient bradycardia, which improved spontaneously. No other side effect was observed in the study population. Propranolol appears to be an effective drug for infantile hemangiomas with good clinical tolerance.

The aim of this prospective study was to examine propranolol's superiority to classical therapy with pulsed dye laser and/or cryosurgery in treating proliferating infantile hemangiomas. Fifteen patients between the ages of 1 and 4 months with proliferating infantile hemangiomas received grinded propranolol tablets 2 mg/kg per day divided in three doses. Twelve patients with proliferating infantile hemangiomas receiving pulsed dye laser and/or cryosurgery were enrolled as controls. Baseline electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and chest x-ray were performed. Monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose was performed every 2 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by performing blinded volume measurements and taking photographs at every visit. Propranolol induced significantly earlier involution and redness reduction of infantile hemangiomas, compared to pulsed dye laser and cryosurgery. Adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, hypotension, or bradycardia did not occur. The dramatic response of infantile hemangiomas to propranolol and few side effects suggest that early treatment of infantile hemangiomas could result in decreased disfigurement.

The most frequent mutation found in patients with LCA10 is a deep intronic mutation in CEP290 that generates a cryptic splice donor site. The large size of the CEP290 gene prevents its use in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene augmentation therapy. Here, we show that targeted genomic deletion using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with LCA10 bearing the CEP290 splice mutation. We generated a cellular model of LCA10 by introducing the CEP290 splice mutation into 293FT cells and we showed that guide RNA pairs coupled with SpCas9 were highly efficient at removing the intronic splice mutation and restoring the expression of wild-type CEP290. In addition, we demonstrated that a dual AAV system could effectively delete an intronic fragment of the Cep290 gene in the mouse retina. To minimize the immune response to prolonged expression of SpCas9, we developed a self-limiting CRISPR/Cas9 system that minimizes the duration of SpCas9 expression. These results support further studies to determine the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies for the treatment of patients with LCA10.",

We have taken advantage of this property to study the regulation of the Delta8-Delta7-sterol isomerase-encoding ERG2 gene in an ergosterol auxotrophic mutant devoid of squalene-synthase activity. Ergosterol starvation leads to an 8-16-fold increase in ERG2 gene expression. Such an increase was also observed in wild-type cells either grown anaerobically or treated with SR31747A a sterol isomerase inhibitor.

Here, we show that both Osh6p and Osh7p interact with Vps4p, a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family. The coiled-coil domain of Osh7p was found to interact with Vps4p in a yeast two-hybrid screen and the interaction between Osh7p and Vps4p appears to be regulated by ergosterol. Deletion of VPS4 induced a dramatic increase in the membrane-associated pools of Osh6p and Osh7p and also caused a decrease in sterol esterification, which was suppressed by overexpression of OSH7. Lastly, overexpression of the coiled-coil domain of Osh7p (Osh7pCC) resulted in a multivesicular body sorting defect, suggesting a dominant negative role of Osh7pCC possibly through inhibiting Vps4p function. Our data suggest that a common mechanism may exist for AAA proteins to regulate the membrane association of yeast OSBP proteins and that these two protein families may function together to control subcellular lipid transport.",

To better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location profiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. A triple hemagglutinin epitope, introduced at the C terminus of Upc2p, conferred a gain-of-function effect on the fusion protein. Location profiling identified 202 bound promoters (P &lt; 0.05). Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose promoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2, SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6, SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11, MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1 transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to ergosterol biosynthesis genes.",

In order to analyze the function of base J in the regulation of antigenic variation, we are characterizing the regulatory mechanism of J biosynthesis. We have recently proposed a model in which chromatin remodeling by a SWI2/SNF2-like protein (JBP2) regulates the developmental and de novo site-specific localization of J synthesis within bloodstream form trypanosome DNA. Consistent with this model, we now show that JBP2 (-/-) bloodstream form trypanosomes contain five-fold less base J and are unable to stimulate de novo J synthesis in newly generated telomeric arrays.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19136460": "Genomic DNA of African trypanosomes contains a hypermodified thymidine residue termed base J (beta-d-glucosyl-HOMedU). This modified base is localized primarily to repetitive DNA, namely the telomeres, and is implicated in the regulation of antigenic variation. The base is synthesized in a two-step pathway. Initially, a thymidine residue in DNA is hydroxylated by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH). This intermediate (HOMedU) is then glucosylated to form base J. Two proteins involved in J synthesis, JBP1 (J binding protein 1) and JBP2, contain a putative TH domain related to the family of Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. We have previously shown that mutations in the TH domain of JBP1 kill its ability to stimulate J synthesis. Here we show that mutation of key residues in the TH domain of JBP2 ablate its ability to induce de novo J synthesis. While the individual JBP1 null and JBP2 null trypanosomes have reduced J levels, the deletion of both JBP1 and JBP2 generates a cell line that completely lacks base J but still contains glucosyl-transferase activity. Reintroduction of JBP2 in the J-null trypanosome stimulates HOMedU formation and site-specific synthesis of base J. We conclude that JBP2 and JBP1 are the TH enzymes involved in J biosynthesis.",

JBP2 is a chromatin re-modeling protein that induces de novo J-synthesis, allowing JBP1, a J-DNA binding protein, to stimulate additional J-synthesis. Here, we show that both JBP2 and JBP1 are capable of stimulating de novo J-synthesis. We localized the JBP1- and JBP2-stimulated J by anti-J immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing. This genome-wide analysis revealed an enrichment of base J at regions flanking polymerase II polycistronic transcription units (Pol II PTUs) throughout the T. brucei genome. Chromosome-internal J deposition is primarily mediated by JBP1, whereas JBP2-stimulated J deposition at the telomeric regions. However, the maintenance of J at JBP1-specific regions is dependent on JBP2 SWI/SNF and TH activity. That similar regions of Leishmania major also contain base J highlights the functional importance of the modified base at Pol II PTUs within members of the kinetoplastid family.

A recent computational screen identified a possible candidate for the base J-associated glucosyltransferase (JGT) in trypanosomatid genomes. We demonstrate that recombinant JGT utilizes uridine diphosphoglucose to transfer glucose to hmU in the context of dsDNA. Mutation of conserved residues typically involved in glucosyltransferase catalysis impairs DNA glucosylation in vitro. The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J. Reintroduction of JGT in the JGT KO restores J synthesis. Ablation of JGT mRNA levels by RNAi leads to the sequential reduction in base J and increased levels of hmU that dissipate rapidly. The analysis of JGT function confirms the two-step J synthesis model and demonstrates that JGT is the only glucosyltransferase enzyme required for the second step of the pathway. Similar to the activity of the related Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases on 5mC, our studies also suggest the ability of the base J-binding protein enzymes to catalyze iterative oxidation of thymine in trypanosome DNA. Here we discuss the regulation of hmU and base J formation in the trypanosome genome by JGT and base J-binding protein.",

The thymidine hydroxylases (JPB1 and JBP2) that catalyze the first step have been characterized, but the identity of the glucosyltransferase catalyzing the second step has proven elusive. Recent bioinformatic analysis by Iyer et al.

We aligned reads to the reference genome sequence to assess data quality metrics and to detect polymorphisms. Alignments revealed 823,325 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 79,961 unique 1- to 3-bp indels in the divergent accessions at a specificity of &gt;99%, and over 2000 potential errors in the reference genome sequence. We also identified &gt;3.4 Mb of the Bur-0 and Tsu-1 genomes as being either extremely dissimilar, deleted, or duplicated relative to the reference genome. To obtain sequences for these regions, we incorporated the Velvet assembler into a targeted de novo assembly method. This approach yielded 10,921 high-confidence contigs that were anchored to flanking sequences and harbored indels as large as 641 bp.

While GSNAP maps a higher proportion of reads, TopHat resulted in a more accurate annotation when used in combination with Cufflinks. Scripture had the lowest sensitivity. Interestingly, after subsampling to the same coverage for GSNAP and TopHat, we find that both mappers have similar performance, implying that the advantage of TopHat is mainly an artifact of the lower coverage. Overall, we observed a low concordance among the different approaches tested both at junction and isoform levels. Using data from both sexes of two adult strains of D. pseudoobscura we detected alternative splicing for about 30% of the FlyBase multiple-exon genes. Moreover, we extended the boundaries for 6523 genes (about 40%). We annotated 669 new genes, 45% of them with splicing evidence. Most of the new genes are located on unassembled contigs, reflecting their incomplete annotation. Finally, we identified 99 additional new genes that are not represented in the current genome contigs of D. pseudoobscura, probably due to location in genomic regions that are difficult to assemble (e.g. heterochromatic regions).",

Two type I topoisomerase mutants (top1) and three endonuclease mutants (end1) were all viable. The double mutant top1 end1 was also viable and, in its extract, Mg2+- and ATP- dependent type II activity could be detected. Three temperature-sensitive (ts-) mutants having heat-sensitive (hs-) type II enzymes were isolated, and the ts- marker cosegregated with the hs- type II activity. All the ts- mutations fell in one gene (top2) tightly linked to leul in chromosome II. The nuclear division of single top2 mutants was blocked at the restrictive temperature, but the formation of a septum was not inhibited so that the nucleus was cut across with the cell plate. In contrast, the double top1 top2 mutants were rapidly arrested at various stages of the cell cycle, showing a strikingly altered nuclear chromatin region. The type II topoisomerase may have an essential role in the compaction and/or segregation of chromosomes during the nuclear division but also complement the defect of the type I enzyme whose major function is the maintenance of chromatin organization throughout the cell cycle.",

A series of yeast expression plasmids was constructed in which segments of the cDNA sequences encoding Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II were inserted under the transcriptional control of yeast GAL1 promoter. Expression of the functional form of Drosophila topoisomerase II cDNA can complement conditionally lethal, temperature-sensitive mutations in the yeast topoisomerase II gene (TOP2), as well as mutations in which the TOP2 locus was disrupted. The survival of these yeast cells depends upon the continuous expression of Drosophila topoisomerase II. Repression of Drosophila gene expression by glucose causes these yeast cells to cease dividing after a few generations. In addition to these genetic complementation data, the expression of the Drosophila topoisomerase II gene in yeast cells with a disruption in TOP2 can also be detected by immunochemical methods with an antibody specific for Drosophila topoisomerase II.",

This homodimeric enzyme catalyzes the cleavage and re-ligation of double-stranded DNA required to separate replicated sister chromatids. Both biochemical and genetic studies show that its catalytic activity is required for chromosome condensation and segregation, and that its decatenation activity can be stimulated by a variety of protein kinases in vitro. In budding yeast, topoisomerase II is most highly phosphorylated in metaphase, and casein kinase II (CKII) was shown to be the major kinase modifying topoisomerase II. We have investigated the effects of phosphorylation of yeast topoisomerase II by CKII in vitro, by means of gel-retardation and filter binding assays. The phosphorylation of the C terminus of topoisomerase II by CKII appears to increase the stability of the complex formed with linear DNA fragments, while dephosphorylation has the opposite effect. Rephosphorylation of phosphatase-treated topoisomerase II by chicken casein kinase II restores a stable protein-DNA complex using a linear DNA fragment. The enhanced stability of the topoisomerase II-DNA complex is also observed with relaxed circular DNA, but not with supercoiled minicircles, in agreement with published results using topoisomerase II from Drosophila. Limited proteolysis and probing with domain-specific antibodies shows that, with the exception of a weakly modified residue between amino acid residues 660 and 1250, all residues modified by casein kinase II are in the last 180 amino acid residues of yeast topoisomerase II.",

While the enzyme cannot perform its essential cellular functions without cleaving DNA, this scission activity is inherently dangerous to chromosomal integrity. In fact, etoposide and other clinically important anticancer drugs kill cells by increasing levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks. Cells rely heavily on recombination to repair double-strand DNA breaks, but the specific pathways used to repair topoisomerase II-generated DNA damage have not been defined. Therefore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model system to delineate the recombination pathways that repair DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II. Yeast cells that expressed wild-type or a drug-hypersensitive mutant topoisomerase II or overexpressed the wild-type enzyme were examined. Based on cytotoxicity and recombination induced by etoposide in different repair-deficient genetic backgrounds, double-strand DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II appear to be repaired primarily by the single-strand invasion pathway of homologous recombination. Non-homologous end joining also was triggered by etoposide treatment, but this pathway was considerably less active than single-strand invasion and did not contribute significantly to cell survival in S.cerevisiae.",

In mammals, G2 and metaphase cell cycle delays induced by Topo II poisons have been proposed to be the result of checkpoint activation in response to the catenation state of DNA. However, the apparent lack of such controls in model organisms has excluded genetic proof that Topo II checkpoints exist and are separable from the conventional DNA damage checkpoint controls. But here, we define a Topo II-dependent G2/M checkpoint in a genetically amenable eukaryote, budding yeast, and demonstrate that this checkpoint enhances cell survival. Conversely, a lack of the checkpoint results in aneuploidy. Neither DNA damage-responsive pathways nor Pds1/securin are needed for this checkpoint. Unusually, spindle assembly checkpoint components are required for the Topo II checkpoint, but checkpoint activation is not the result of failed chromosome biorientation or a lack of spindle tension. Thus, compromised Topo II function activates a yeast checkpoint system that operates by a novel mechanism.",

Although anti-topoisomerase 2 (Top2) drugs are clinically important antibiotics and chemotherapies, to our knowledge, the mechanisms of cell killing by Top2 depletion and inactivation have never been directly compared. We show that depletion of Top2 protein from budding yeast cells prevents DNA decatenation during S phase. Cells complete DNA replication and enter the ensuing mitosis on schedule, suffering extensive chromosome missegregation. Cytokinesis through incompletely segregated chromosomes causes lethal DNA damage. By contrast, expression of catalytically inactive Top2 causes a stable G2 arrest requiring an intact DNA damage checkpoint. Checkpoint activation correlates with an inability to complete DNA replication, resulting in hypercatenated, gapped daughter DNA molecules. Thus, Top2 depletion and inactivation kill cells by different mechanisms, which has implications for understanding the nature of the catenation checkpoint, how DNA replication terminates, how anti-Top2 drugs work, and how new drugs might be designed.",

In a genetic screen, we identified a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of topoisomerase 2 that exhibits conditional synthetic lethality with a chk1 knockout strain. The mutant allele of topoisomerase 2 is defective in chromosome segregation at a non-permissive temperature and there was increase in chromosome segregation defects in the double mutant of top2-10 and chk1 delete at a non-permissive temperature. More importantly, topoisomearse 2 mutant cells mildly delay the mitotic progression at non-permissive temperature that is mediated by checkpoint protein kinase Chk1. Additionally, top2-10 mutant cells also activate the Chk1 at a non-permissive temperature and this activation of Chk1 takes place at the time of mitosis. Interestingly, top2-10 mutant cells retain their viability at a non-permissive temperature if the cells are not allowed to enter into mitosis. Taking together our results, we speculate that in the top2-10 mutant, the segregation of entangled chromatids during mitosis could result in delaying the mitotic progression through the activation of Chk1 kinase.",

Apart from these general tasks, topo II participates in more specialized functions. In mammals, topo II\u03b1 interacts with specific RNA polymerases and chromatin-remodeling complexes, whereas topo II\u03b2 regulates developmental genes in conjunction with chromatin remodeling and heterochromatin transitions. Here we show that in budding yeast, topo II regulates the expression of specific gene subsets. To uncover this, we carried out a genomic transcription run-on shortly after the thermal inactivation of topo II. We identified a modest number of genes not involved in the general stress response but strictly dependent on topo II. These genes present distinctive functional and structural traits in comparison with the genome average. Yeast topo II is a positive regulator of genes with well-defined promoter architecture that associates to chromatin remodeling complexes; it is a negative regulator of genes extremely hypo-acetylated with complex promoters and undefined nucleosome positioning, many of which are involved in polyamine transport. These findings indicate that yeast topo II operates on singular chromatin architectures to activate or repress DNA transcription and that this activity produces functional responses to ensure chromatin stability.",

Phosphorylation has been shown to stimulate topoisomerase II activity in vitro. Here we show that topoisomerase II is a phosphoprotein in yeast and that the level of incorporated phosphate is significantly higher at mitosis than in G1. Comparison of tryptic phosphopeptide maps reveals that the major phosphorylation sites in vivo are targets for casein kinase II. Incorporation of phosphate into topoisomerase II is nearly undetectable at the non-permissive temperature in a conditional casein kinase II mutant. The sites modified by casein kinase II are located in the extreme C-terminal domain of topoisomerase II. This domain is absent in prokaryotic and highly divergent among eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, and may serve to regulate functions of topoisomerase II that are unique to eukaryotic cells.",

However, plasmids carrying transcriptionally active genes are found to be extremely negatively supercoiled when isolated from mutants lacking topoisomerase I. Supercoiling occurs during transcriptional elongation rather than during transcriptional activation. It takes place in the absence of topoisomerase I and does not seem to be dependent on topoisomerase II since it can occur at the nonpermissive temperature in a top1-top2 ts mutant. Whether this change in linking number is due to an unusual form of topoisomerase II or whether it is due to a new enzyme has yet to be determined. The results suggest that topoisomerase I is normally required to relax transcriptionally induced supercoils. A model is discussed which considers the role of topoisomerases in the movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA template.",

In vertebrate cells, topoisomerase II was shown to be the most abundant component of the metaphase chromosomal scaffold, and has been shown to play a role in chromosome condensation in vitro. The cell cycle control of chromosome condensation may well require phosphorylation of topoisomerase II, since the enzyme is more highly phosphorylated in metaphase than in G1. Recent studies have identified casein kinase II as the major enzyme phosphorylating topoisomerase II in intact yeast cells.

Clinically, these blepharophimosis-ID syndromes have been classified in five distinct subgroups, including the Maat-Kievit-Brunner (MKB) type, which, in contrast to the others, is characterized by X-linked inheritance and facial coarsening at older age. We performed exome sequencing in two families, each with two affected males with Ohdo syndrome MKB type. In the two families, MED12 missense mutations (c.3443G&gt;A [p.Arg1148His] or c.3493T&gt;C [p.Ser1165Pro]) segregating with the phenotype were identified. Upon subsequent analysis of an additional cohort of nine simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome, one additional de novo missense change (c.5185C&gt;A [p.His1729Asn]) in MED12 was detected. The occurrence of three different hemizygous missense mutations in three unrelated families affected by Ohdo syndrome MKB type shows that mutations in MED12 are the underlying cause of this X-linked form of Ohdo syndrome. Together with the recently described KAT6B mutations resulting in Ohdo syndrome Say/Barber/Biesecker/Young/Simpson type, our findings point to aberrant chromatin modification as being central to the pathogenesis of Ohdo syndrome.",

Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons identified a frameshift mutation (c.5898dupC) of MED12. Mutated mRNA was not affected by non-sense mediated RNA decay and induced an additional abnormal isoform due to activation of cryptic splice-sites in exon 41. Dysmorphic features common to most affected males were long narrow face, high forehead, flat malar area, high nasal bridge, and short philtrum. Language was absent or very limited. Most patients had a friendly personality. Cognitive impairment, varying from borderline to profound ID was similarly observed in seven heterozygous females. There was no correlation between cognitive function and X-chromosome inactivation profiles in blood cells. The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense mutations. In a cognitively impaired male from this family, who also presented with tall stature and dysmorphism and did not have the MED12 mutation, a 600-kb duplication at 17p13.3 including the YWHAE gene, was found in a mosaic state.",

This may explain its role in several different X-linked intellectual disability syndromes that share some overlapping clinical features. This review will compare and contrast four different clinical conditions that have been associated with different mutations in MED12, which is located at Xq13. To date, these conditions include Opitz-Kaveggia (FG) syndrome, Lujan syndrome, Ohdo syndrome (Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, or OSMKB), and one large family with profound X-linked intellectual disability due to a novel c.5898insC frameshift mutation that unlike the other three syndromes, resulted in affected female carriers and truncation of the MED12 protein. It is likely that more MED12 mutations will be detected in sporadic patients and X-linked families with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features as exome sequencing becomes more commonly utilized, and this overview of MED12-related disorders may help to correlate MED12 genotypes with clinical findings.",

Current testing methods have been able to identify over 100 genes on the X chromosome responsible for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes. MED12 [MIM *300188] (mediator complex subunit 12) mutations have been linked to numerous XLID syndromes, including Lujan, FG, and Ohdo, and MED12 is included in many XLID panels.

The siblings share some features of Ohdo syndrome, including feeding difficulties, microcephaly, and speech delay. However, additional attributes such as hypertonia, eosinophilic esophagitis, penile chordee, and particular facial dysmorphisms depart sufficiently from individuals previously described such that they appear to represent a new and expanded phenotype. This case lends credence to the evolving theory that the subtypes of Ohdo, and perhaps other MED12 disorders, reflect a spectrum of characteristics, rather than distinct syndromes. As XLID panel testing and whole exome sequencing (WES) becomes a standard of care for affected males, further MED12 mutations will broaden the phenotype of these intriguing disorders and challenge clinicians to rethink the current diagnostic boundaries.",

However, there has been no published evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for this indication. To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na\u00efve patients with unresectable or meta-static melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective. A partitioned-survival model was developed, which divided overall survival time into progression-free survival and postprogression survival. The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. Extrapolation of progression-free survival and overall survival beyond the clinical trial was based on parametric functions and literature data. The base-case time horizon was 20 years, and costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Clinical data-including progression-free survival and overall survival data spanning a median follow-up time of 15 months, as well as quality of life and adverse event data from the ongoing KEYNOTE-006 trial-and cost data from public sources were used to populate the model. Costs included those of drug acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and disease management of advanced melanoma. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost difference per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was the main outcome, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. In the base case, pembrolizumab was projected to increase the life expectancy of U.S. patients with advanced melanoma by 1.14 years, corresponding to a gain of 0.79 discounted QALYs over ipilimumab. The model also projected an average increase of $63,680 in discounted perpatient costs of treatment with pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab. The corresponding ICER was $81,091 per QALY ($68,712 per life-year) over a 20-year time horizon. With $100,000 per QALY as the threshold, when input parameters were varied in deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses, the use of pembrolizumab was cost-effective relative to ipilimumab in most ranges. Further, in a comprehensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the ICER was cost-effective in 83% of the simulations.

We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment).

The response rate was improved with pembrolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7%) and every 3 weeks (32.9%), as compared with ipilimumab (11.9%) (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Responses were ongoing in 89.4%, 96.7%, and 87.9% of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3% and 10.1%) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9%). The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.

A cost-effectiveness model was developed to analyze the costs and consequences of treatment with pembrolizumab compared to treatment with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma not previously treated with ipilimumab. The model was parameterized by using data from a head-to-head phase III randomized clinical trial, KEYNOTE-006. Extrapolation of long-term outcomes was based on approaches previously applied, combining ipilimumab data and melanoma patients' registry data. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service, and a lifetime horizon (40 years) was used. Portugal-specific disease management costs were estimated by convening a panel of six clinical experts to derive health state resource use and multiplying the results by national unit costs. To test for the robustness of the conclusions, we conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Pembrolizumab increases life expectancy in 1.57 undiscounted life-years (LYs) and is associated with an increase in costs versus that of ipilimumab. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is \u20ac47,221 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and \u20ac42,956 per LY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to the change of most input values or assumptions and were sensitive to time on treatment scenarios. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis performed, pembrolizumab is associated with a cost per QALY gained inferior to \u20ac50,000 in 75% of the cases. Considering the usually accepted thresholds in oncology, pembrolizumab is a cost-effective alternative for treating patients with advanced melanoma in Portugal.",

The decision aid was acceptable for patients and successfully decreased decisional conflict. This study suggests the possible utility of leveraging the patient portal to enhance patient education and decision making in osteoporosis care. Although interventions have improved osteoporosis screening and/or treatment for certain populations of high-risk patients, recent national studies suggest that large-scale uptake of these interventions has been limited. We aimed to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of a patient portal-based osteoporosis decision aid (DA). We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of primary care patients aged \u226555 who were enrolled in a patient portal and had a T-score of &lt;-1. Intervention subjects were provided a link to a patient DA. The DA contained a 10-year fracture risk calculator, summary of medication risks and benefits (prescription and nonprescription), and an elicitation of values. Subjects completed questionnaires assessing the primary outcomes of decisional conflict and preparation for decision making and secondary outcomes related to feasibility and planning for a larger trial. Charts were reviewed for physician-subject interactions and medication uptake. The DA was acceptable to subjects, but 17 % of the patients in the decision aid arm incorrectly entered their T-scores into FRAX-based risk calculator. Decisional conflict was lower post-intervention for those who were randomized to the decision aid arm compared to controls (17.8 vs. 47.1, p &lt; .001), and there was a significant difference in the percentage of patients who made a treatment decision at 3 months. No significant differences were observed in medication uptake. A portal-based osteoporosis DA was acceptable and improved several measures of decision quality. Given its effect on improving the quality of patients' decisions, future studies should examine whether it improves physician guideline adherence or medication adherence uptake among treated patients.",

Patients with a previous fracture, parental hip fracture, low femoral T-score, higher age, and higher BMI were more likely to underestimate their risks. Patients also failed to associate risk factors with an increased risk of fractures. The main objectives were to explore associations between self-perceived 10-year fracture risks of women with osteoporosis (OP) and their risks calculated by the FRAX\u00ae algorithm and to identify determinants of the underestimation of risk. We carried out a cross-sectional study in 11 OP centers in Hungary and collected data on the risk factors considered by the FRAX\u00ae calculator. Patients estimated their subjective 10-year probability of any major osteoporotic and hip fracture numerically, in percentages and also on a visual analog scale (VAS). We compared subjective and FRAX\u00ae estimates and applied logistic regression to analyze the determinants of the underestimation of risk. Associations between risk factors and subjective risk were explored using linear probability models. Nine hundred seventy-two OP patients were included in the analysis. Major OP and hip fracture risk by FRAX\u00ae were on average 20.1 and 10.5%, while subjective estimates were significantly higher, 30.0 and 24.7%, respectively. Correlations between FRAX\u00ae and subjective measures were very weak (r = 0.12-0.16). Underestimation of major OP fracture risk was associated with having had a single previous fracture (OR = 2.0), parental hip fracture (OR = 3.4), femoral T-score \u2264-2.5 (OR = 4.2), higher age, body mass index, and better general health state. We did not find significant associations between subjective risk estimates and most of the risk factors except for previous fractures. Hungarian OP patients fail to recognize most of the risk factors of fractures. Thus, education of patients about these risk factors would be beneficial especially for the elderly with a low femoral T-score and parental hip fracture history.",

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that renal osteodystrophy may coexist with osteoporosis. The World Health Organization's bone mineral density (BMD) criteria for osteopenia ( -2.5 &lt; T-score &lt; -1.0) and osteoporosis (a T-score \u2264 -2.5) may be used in patients with CKD stages 1-3. In CKD stages 4-5, BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is less predictive and may underestimate fracture risk. The development of absolute fracture risk (AFR) algorithms, such as FRAX\u00ae and the Garvan absolute fracture risk calculator, to predict risk of fracture over a given time (usually 10 years) aims to incorporate non-BMD risk factors into the clinical assessment. FRAX\u00ae has been shown to be useful to assess fracture risk in CKD but may underestimate fracture risk in advanced CKD. The trabecular bone score is a measure of grey scale homogeneity obtained from spine DXA, which correlates to trabecular microarchitecture and is an independent risk factor for fracture. Recent data demonstrate the potential utility of the trabecular bone score adjustment of AFR through the FRAX\u00ae algorithm in subjects with CKD. Parameters of bone microarchitecture using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) or high-resolution pQCT are also able to discriminate fracture status in subjects with CKD. However, there are at present no convincing data that the addition of pQCT or high-resolution pQCT parameters to DXA BMD improves fracture discrimination. More advanced estimates of bone strength derived from measurements of micro-architecture, by QCT-derived finite element analysis may be incorporated into AFR algorithms in the future.",

THE GOAL: was an evaluation of the correlation between 10-year risk of death from CVD and 10-year bone fracture risk (FRAX). A total of 79 patients of the Regional Centre of Menopause and Osteoporosis of the Military Teaching Hospital in Lodz (Poland), aged 50-83 years, consulted for osteoporosis were divided into two groups: study group - with osteoporosis (O; T-score \u2264 -2.5 SD) and control - without osteoporosis (T-sc &gt; -2.5). Bone mineral density was evaluated by densitometric scanning of spine (L2-L4 T-score) and/or femoral neck (Neck T-score) and/or total hip (Total Hip T-score). Total cholesterol (TC), fasting glucose, arterial blood pressure, medical history, and family history were obtained. The risk of fatal-CVD was assessed by Euro Heart Score (EHS), and major osteoporotic (MOFR) and hip fracture risk (HFR) by the FRAX scale. 80% of the patients (32/40) with osteoporosis and 51% (20/39) of the patients without osteoporosis revealed a HeartScore \u2265 5%. There was correlation in the group of all patients between EHS and Neck T-score (p &lt; 0.05; Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Rs) = -0.3806), L2-L4 T-score (p &lt; 0.05; Rs = -0.2891), and Total Hip T-score (p &lt; 0.005; Rs = -0.3561), and in the control group - between EHS and Neck T-score (p &lt; 0.05; Rs = -0.3502). There was a 2.33% difference between the average EHS level to the disadvantage of patients with osteoporosis (p &lt; 0.05). EHS positively correlated with MOFR (p &lt; 0.001) and HFR (p &lt; 0.001) in the whole study popula-tion and with MOFR (p &lt; 0.05) and HFR (p &lt; 0.01) in the group of osteoporotic patients. There were differences between groups in TC (p &lt; 0.001) and BMI (p &lt; 0.001) levels. The 10-year risk of fatal-CVD correlated with osteoporosis and with the 10-year osteoporotic fracture risk.

In the study, 200 patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged more than 40 years in Peking University First Hospital from Dec. 2009 to Dec. 2012 were recruited. Clinical information was obtained from a questionnaire of their case history and medical records. FRAX tool was administered. Their lumber spine and left femoral BMD were determined by dual energy X ray absorptiometry. The gender, age, disease duration, menopause status, body mass index (BMI) and accumulative dose of glucocorticoid were obtained in retrospect. Correlation analysis was conducted between the BMD and clinical information. The study population (female, 77.5%) had a mean age of 59.4 years, in which 10 (13%) patients showed a normal BMD, 67 (87%) were osteopenia or osteoporosis, while 32 patients (16%) had fragile fracture. Compared with the patients with normal BMD, the subjects with low BMD had significantly older age, longer period for corticoids usage, higher day dose and accumulated dose of corticoids.The 10-year fracture risk of sustaining major osteoporotic fractures and hip fracture was higher. No significant difference was observed between the 10-year fracture risks calculated with BMD and without BMD. The values of the different area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for major and hip fractures calculated in three ways: without BMD, with the femoral neck BMD, and with T-score. The best result was for FRAX tool for hip fracture with the T-score (AUC 0.899). A stepwise multivariate linear regression model was constructed to explore the relationship between the different clinical factors studied and a low BMD. Three statistically significant variables for lumber BMD were pain on visual assessment scale (VAS) (P=0.02), fracture history (P=0.003) and a higher steroid accumulated dose (P=0.008). Three statistically significant variables for left hip BMD were age (P&lt;0.001), fracture history (P=0.05) and lower BMI (P=0.03). Low BMD is a common complication in RA patients. Risk factors for major fracture and hip fracture are increased. There is a positive correlation between FRAX calculated with and without BMD or T score. FRAX with the femoral neck T score or BMD presents a discriminatory capacity better than FRAX without BMD, according to the AUC ROC.",

As the majority of patients who fracture have fallen, it follows that people who fall can usefully be targeted in any programme that aims to reduce osteoporotic fracture. Targeting vulnerable patients who are likely to benefit from intervention may help shift the management of fracture prevention into primary care, away from emergency departments. Paramedics who attend to patients who have fallen may be well placed to assess future fracture risk, using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and communicate that information directly to general practitioners (GPs). This feasibility study takes the form of a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial aimed at exploring and refining issues of study design, recruitment, retention, sample size and acceptability preceding a large-scale study with fracture as the end point. Patients (aged &gt;50) who fall, call an ambulance, are attended by a study paramedic and give verbal consent will be asked FRAX and fall questions. Patients who subsequently formally consent to participation will be randomised to control (usual care) or intervention groups. Intervention will constitute transmission of calculated future fracture risk to the patients' GP with suitable, evidence-based recommendations for investigation or treatment. 3 months after the index fall, data (proportion of patients in each group undergoing investigation or starting new treatment, quality of life and health economic) will be collected and analysed using descriptive statistics. A nested qualitative study will explore issues of acceptability and study design with patients, paramedics and GPs.

This study was designed to identify predictors of osteoporosis and vertebral fractures in patients presenting with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We studied 85 patients (mean age = 75 years; 92% men) with moderate to very severe COPD. Osteoporosis and vertebral fractures were diagnosed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometric scan and vertebral X-rays, respectively. Patient characteristics, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and results of pulmonary function tests, chest computed tomography scan, blood and urinary biomarkers of bone turnover were recorded, and a FRAX score was calculated by a computer-based algorithm. Osteoporosis, defined as a T score &lt; -2.5, found in 20 patients (24%), was associated with female gender, BMI, dyspnea scale, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), vital capacity (VC), emphysema score on computed tomography, measurements of serum and urinary biomarkers of bone turnover. Vertebral fractures, diagnosed in 29 patients (35%), were strongly correlated with age, LTOT, VC, and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, treatment with oral corticosteroid or warfarin, and weakly associated with the presence of osteoporosis. There was no correlation between FRAX score and prevalence of vertebral fractures, suggesting that neither BMD alone nor FRAX score would predict the presence of vertebral fractures in COPD patients. A disease-specific algorithm to predict osteoporotic fractures is needed to improve the management of patients suffering from COPD.",

Cross-sectional observational study. Fifty HIV-positive men treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy and 27 controls underwent hormonal evaluation, BMD scan and spine X-ray. The AMS questionnaire was administered. Osteoporosis was found in 24\u00b70% of HIV patients and in 3\u00b77% of controls (P = 0\u00b705).

Clodronate and bazedoxifene reduced nonvertebral and clinical fracture more effectively on a relative scale in women with higher FRAX scores. We used data from the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) to evaluate the interaction between FRAX score and treatment with alendronate. We combined the Clinical Fracture (CF) arm and Vertebral Fracture (VF) arm of FIT. The CF and VF arm of FIT randomized 4432 and 2027 women, respectively, to placebo or alendronate for 4 and 3 years, respectively. FRAX risk factors were assessed at baseline. FRAX scores were calculated by WHO. We used Poisson regression models to assess the interaction between alendronate and FRAX score on the risk of nonvertebral, clinical, major osteoporotic, and radiographic vertebral fractures. Overall, alendronate significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fracture (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.99), but the effect was greater for femoral neck (FN) bone mineral density (BMD) T-score \u2264 -2.5 (IRR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93) than for FN T-score &gt; -2.5 (IRR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.80-1.16) (p = 0.02, interaction between alendronate and FN BMD). However, there was no evidence of an interaction between alendronate and FRAX score with FN BMD for risk of nonvertebral fracture (interaction p = 0.61). The absolute benefit of alendronate was greatest among women with highest FRAX scores. Results were similar for clinical fractures, major osteoporotic fractures, and radiographic vertebral fractures and whether or not FRAX scores included FN BMD. Among this cohort of women with low bone mass there was no significant interaction between FRAX score and alendronate for nonvertebral, clinical or major osteoporotic fractures, or radiographic vertebral fractures. These results suggest that the effect of alendronate on a relative scale does not vary by FRAX score. A randomized controlled trial testing the effect of antifracture agents among women with high FRAX score but without osteoporosis is warranted.",

To assess the accuracy of pre-BMD FRAX scores in identifying at risk IBD patients needing BMD measurement (intermediate risk) and/or therapy (high risk). We calculated FRAX scores retrospectively in 116 consecutive IBD out-patients (81 Crohn's disease, 35 ulcerative colitis), who were having DEXA scans in 2005-2009 because they were considered at risk of osteoporosis. On DEXA scans, 47% (38/81) and 12% (10/81) patients with Crohn's disease were osteopaenic and osteoporotic, respectively; equivalent figures for patients with UC were 34% (12/35) and 14% (5/35). The clinical FRAX score alone, when compared with the FRAX score including the BMD result, had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 70-100%), specificity of 40% (95% CI: 31-50%), positive predictive value of 16% (95% CI: 9-27%) and negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 90-100%) in identifying those patients needing BMD measurement (intermediate risk) or preventive therapy (high risk).

Although falls increase fracture risk, they have not been incorporated into FRAX. It is currently unclear if FRAX captures falls risk and whether addition of falls would improve fracture prediction. We aimed to investigate the association of falls risk and Australian-specific FRAX. Clinical risk factors were documented for 735 men and 602 women (age 40-90 yr) assessed at follow-up (2006-2010 and 2000-2003, respectively) of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. FRAX scores with and without BMD were calculated. A falls risk score was determined at the time of BMD assessment and self-reported incident falls were documented from questionnaires returned one year later. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine: (i) cross-sectional association between FRAX scores and falls risk score (Elderly Falls Screening Test, EFST) and (ii) prospective relationship between FRAX and time to a fall. There was an association between FRAX (hip with BMD) and EFST scores (\u03b2 = 0.07, p &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for sex and age, the relationship became non-significant (\u03b2 = 0.00, p = 0.79). The risk of incident falls increased with increasing FRAX (hip with BMD) score (unadjusted HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07). After adjustment for age and sex, the relationship became non-significant (1.01, 95% CI 0.97, 1.05). There is a weak positive correlation between FRAX and falls risk score, that is likely explained by the inclusion of age and sex in the FRAX model. These data suggest that FRAX score may not be a robust surrogate for falls risk and that inclusion of falls in fracture risk assessment should be further explored.",

Neurofibromin encoded by the NF1 causal gene regulates Ras/MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways. These signaling pathways play critical roles in controlling gene transcription during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We hypothesized that NF1 mutations disturb the expression of genes important for memory formation. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA microarray analysis on the hippocampus of NF1(+/-) mice, the mouse model for NF1 learning disabilities. Our results indicated that genes involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes are dysregulated in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. Many of the NF1-affected genes play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, such as Rabs, synaptotagmins, NMDAR1, CaMKII, and CREB1. Because NF1-associated learning disabilities can be reversed by lovastatin, we also determined the effect of lovastatin treatment on genome-wide expression patterns of the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. We found that lovastatin altered the expression of a large number of genes, including those disturbed by NF1 mutations. Our results reveal a genome-wide overview of the molecular abnormalities in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus and should be useful for further identifying the novel molecular pathways that cause NF1 learning deficits.",

In addition, &gt;40% of afflicted children have learning difficulties. The NF1 protein contains a highly conserved GTPase-activating protein domain that inhibits Ras activity, and the C-terminal region regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase. Behavioral analysis indicates that learning is disrupted in both Drosophila and mouse NF1 models. Our previous work has shown that defective cAMP signaling leads to the learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants. In the present report, our experiments showed that in addition to learning, long-term memory was also abolished in Nf1 mutants. However, altered NF1-regulated Ras activity is responsible for this defect rather than altered cAMP levels. Furthermore, by expressing clinically relevant human NF1 mutations and deletions in Drosophila Nf1-null mutants, we demonstrated that the GAP-related domain of NF1 was necessary and sufficient for long-term memory, whereas the C-terminal domain of NF1 was essential for immediate memory. Thus, we show that two separate functional domains of the same protein can participate independently in the formation of two distinct memory components.",

These approaches provide an opportunity to modify the genomes of inbred mice, and allow the removal of strain-specific mutations that confound phenotypic assessment. One such mutation is the Cdh23 (ahl) allele, present in several commonly used inbred mouse strains, which predisposes to age-related progressive hearing loss. We have used targeted CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) to correct the Cdh23 (ahl) allele directly in C57BL/6NTac zygotes. Employing offset-nicking Cas9 (D10A) nickase with paired RNA guides and a single-stranded oligonucleotide donor template we show that allele repair was successfully achieved. To investigate potential Cas9-mediated 'off-target' mutations in our corrected mouse, we undertook whole-genome sequencing and assessed the 'off-target' sites predicted for the guide RNAs (\u22644 nucleotide mis-matches). No induced sequence changes were identified at any of these sites. Correction of the progressive hearing loss phenotype was demonstrated using auditory-evoked brainstem response testing of mice at 24 and 36 weeks of age, and rescue of the progressive loss of sensory hair cell stereocilia bundles was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy of dissected cochleae from 36-week-old mice. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR has been successfully utilised to efficiently correct the Cdh23 (ahl) allele in C57BL/6NTac mice, and rescue the associated auditory phenotype. The corrected mice described in this report will allow age-related auditory phenotyping studies to be undertaken using C57BL/6NTac-derived models, such as those generated by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) programme.",

Defects in hair cells are one of the major causes of deafness. A combination of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology with genome-editing technology may provide an attractive cell-based strategy to regenerate hair cells and treat hereditary deafness in humans. Here, we report the generation of iPSCs from members of a Chinese family carrying MYO15A c.4642G&gt;A and c.8374G&gt;A mutations and the induction of hair cell-like cells from those iPSCs. The compound heterozygous MYO15A mutations resulted in abnormal morphology and dysfunction of the derived hair cell-like cells. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to genetically correct the MYO15A mutation in the iPSCs and rescued the morphology and function of the derived hair cell-like cells. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of generating inner ear hair cells from human iPSCs and the functional rescue of gene mutation-based deafness by using genetic correction.",

Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders, affecting approximately 1 in 500 newborns with no treatment. Mutations of inner ear genes contribute to the largest portion of genetic deafness. The simplicity and robustness of CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome editing in human cells and model organisms such as zebrafish, mice and primates make it a promising technology in hearing research. With CRISPR/Cas9 technology, functions of inner ear genes can be studied efficiently by the disruption of normal gene alleles through non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) mechanism. For genetic hearing loss, CRISPR/Cas9 has potential to repair gene mutations by homology-directed-repair (HDR) or to disrupt dominant mutations by NHEJ, which could restore hearing. Our recent work has shown CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can be efficiently performed in the mammalian inner ear in vivo. Thus, application of CRISPR/Cas9 in hearing research will open up new avenues for understanding the pathology of genetic hearing loss and provide new routes in the development of treatment to restore hearing. In this review, we describe major methodologies currently used for genome editing. We will highlight applications of these technologies in studies of genetic disorders and discuss issues pertaining to applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in auditory systems implicated in genetic hearing loss.",

The correction of gene mutations in iPSCs could restore the normal function of cells and provide a rich source of cells for transplantation. In the present study, iPSCs were generated from a deaf patient with compound heterozygous MYO7A mutations (c.1184G&gt;A and c.4118C&gt;T; P-iPSCs), the asymptomatic father of the patient (MYO7A c.1184G&gt;A mutation; CF-iPSCs), and a normal donor (MYO7A(WT/WT); C-iPSCs). One of MYO7A mutation sites (c.4118C&gt;T) in the P-iPSCs was corrected using CRISPR/Cas9. The corrected iPSCs (CP-iPSCs) retained cell pluripotency and normal karyotypes. Hair cell-like cells induced from CP-iPSCs showed restored organization of stereocilia-like protrusions; moreover, the electrophysiological function of these cells was similar to that of cells induced from C-iPSCs and CF-iPSCs. These results might facilitate the development of iPSC-based gene therapy for genetic disorders. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from a deaf patient with compound heterozygous MYO7A mutations (c.1184G&gt;A and c.4118C&gt;T).

The genetic correction of MYO7A mutation resulted in morphologic and functional recovery of hair cell-like cells derived from iPSCs. These findings confirm the hypothesis that MYO7A plays an important role in the assembly of stereocilia into stereociliary bundles. Thus, the present study might provide further insight into the pathogenesis of sensorineural hearing loss and facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies against monogenic disease through the genetic repair of patient-specific iPSCs.",

Exons, and especially splice sites, have higher levels of DNA methylation than flanking introns, and the splicing of about 22% of alternative exons is regulated by DNA methylation. Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing. The first involves modulation of the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); the second involves the formation of a protein bridge by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that recruits splicing factors onto transcribed alternative exons.

As commonly altered genomic regions point to candidate genes involved in leukemogenesis, we used microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism profiling data of 391 AML cases to further narrow down genomic regions of interest. Targeted resequencing of 1000 genes located in the critical regions was performed in a representative cohort of 50 AML samples comprising all major cytogenetic subgroups. We identified 120 missense/nonsense mutations as well as 60 insertions/deletions affecting 73 different genes (\u223c 3.6 tumor-specific aberrations/AML). While most of the newly identified alterations were nonrecurrent, we observed an enrichment of mutations affecting genes involved in epigenetic regulation including known candidates like TET2, TET1, DNMT3A, and DNMT1, as well as mutations in the histone methyltransferases NSD1, EZH2, and MLL3. Furthermore, we found mutations in the splicing factor SFPQ and in the nonclassic regulators of mRNA processing CTCF and RAD21. These splicing-related mutations affected 10% of AML patients in a mutually exclusive manner. In conclusion, we could identify a large number of alterations in genes involved in aberrant splicing and epigenetic regulation in genomic regions commonly altered in AML, highlighting their important role in the molecular pathogenesis of AML.",

A typical host has between 10(4) and 10(5) clones of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes, each clone distinguished by the genomic integration site of the single-copy HTLV-1 provirus. The HTLV-1 bZIP (HBZ) factor gene is constitutively expressed from the minus strand of the provirus, whereas plus-strand expression, required for viral propagation to uninfected cells, is suppressed or intermittent in vivo, allowing escape from host immune surveillance. It remains unknown what regulates this pattern of proviral transcription and latency. Here, we show that CTCF, a key regulator of chromatin structure and function, binds to the provirus at a sharp border in epigenetic modifications in the pX region of the HTLV-1 provirus in T cells naturally infected with HTLV-1. CTCF is a zinc-finger protein that binds to an insulator region in genomic DNA and plays a fundamental role in controlling higher order chromatin structure and gene expression in vertebrate cells. We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin. CTCF-binding sites (CTCF-BSs) have been propagated throughout the genome by transposons in certain primate lineages, but CTCF binding has not previously been described in present-day exogenous retroviruses. The presence of an ectopic CTCF-BS introduced by the retrovirus in tens of thousands of genomic locations has the potential to cause widespread abnormalities in host cell chromatin structure and gene expression.",

Widely separated sites on DNA, occupied by both CTCF and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also mediated by CTCF, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these CTCF interactions have specific rules for the orientation of the paired CTCF sites, implying the existence of a nonequilibrium mechanism of generation. Recent experiments that invert, delete, or inactivate one of a mating CTCF pair result in major changes in patterns of organization and gene expression in the surrounding regions. What remain to be determined are the detailed molecular mechanisms for re-establishing loop domains and maintaining them after replication and mitosis. As recently published data show, some mechanisms may involve interactions with noncoding RNAs as well as protein cofactors. Many CTCF sites are also involved in other functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied for some time.",

However, the mechanisms governing dynamic DNA methylation at CTCF-binding sites were unclear. Here, we reveal the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 as active regulators of CTCF-mediated alternative splicing through conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidation derivatives. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine are enriched at an intragenic CTCF-binding sites in the CD45 model gene and are associated with alternative exon inclusion. Reduced TET levels culminate in increased 5-methylcytosine, resulting in CTCF eviction and exon exclusion. In vitro analyses establish the oxidation derivatives are not sufficient to stimulate splicing, but efficiently promote CTCF association. We further show genomewide that reciprocal exchange of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine at downstream CTCF-binding sites is a general feature of alternative splicing in na\u00efve and activated CD4(+) T cells. These findings significantly expand our current concept of the pre-mRNA \"splicing code\" to include dynamic intragenic DNA methylation catalyzed by the TET proteins.",

Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. These results raise the question of whether these proteins may associate at the chromatin level to modulate alternative splicing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data for CTCF, AGO1, HP1\u03b1, H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K36me3, RNAPII, total H3 and 5metC and alternative splicing arrays from two cell lines, we have analyzed the combinatorial code of their binding to chromatin in relation to the alternative splicing patterns between two cell lines, MCF7 and MCF10. Using Machine Learning techniques, we identified the changes in chromatin signals that are most significantly associated with splicing regulation between these two cell lines. Moreover, we have built a map of the chromatin signals on the pre-mRNA, that is, a chromatin-based RNA-map, which can explain 606 (68.55%) of the regulated events between MCF7 and MCF10. This chromatin code involves the presence of HP1\u03b1, CTCF, AGO1, RNAPII and histone marks around regulated exons and can differentiate patterns of skipping and inclusion. Additionally, we found a significant association of HP1\u03b1 and CTCF activities around the regulated exons and a putative DNA binding site for HP1\u03b1. Our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of HP1\u03b1 and CTCF near regulated exons. Additionally, we find further evidence for the involvement of HP1\u03b1 and AGO1 in chromatin-related splicing regulation.",

Transcriptional control of DNA viruses by host cell factors is important in the temporal and spatial regulation of virus gene expression. Many of these factors are recruited to enhance virus gene expression and thereby increase virus production, but host cell factors can also restrict virus gene expression and productivity of infection. CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) is a host cell DNA binding protein important for the regulation of genomic chromatin boundaries, transcriptional control and enhancer element usage. CTCF also functions in RNA polymerase II regulation and in doing so can influence co-transcriptional splicing events. Several DNA viruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) utilize CTCF to control virus gene expression and many studies have highlighted a role for CTCF in the persistence of these diverse oncogenic viruses.

The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation.",

Aberrant transcriptional activity of WT1 is a key finding in the genesis of Wilms tumors (WTs). However, the mechanisms responsible for this alteration remain poorly understood. In the present study, we examined the methylation pattern of a putative CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding site downstream of the WT1 gene as a potential cause of WT1 misregulation in 44 native WT specimens. We found that 16 WT cases exhibited a much higher WT1 expression compared to normal kidney tissue, and that the high mRNA expression of WT1 is strongly correlated with a high degree of DNA methylation of the CTCF binding site near the WT1 promoter. However, there was no correlation between the KTS+/KTS- splicing variants of WT1 and the methylation status of the CpGs of the CTCF binding site. Our results demonstrated an aberrant methylation pattern at a CTCF binding site downstream the WT1 gene, which is associated with an elevated WT1 transcriptional activity. Thus, methylation of the CTCF binding site may be partially responsible for the transcriptional activation of the WT1 locus and hypermethylation of this site may be an important oncogenic mechanism in the genesis of WT.",

The primary aim of this study was to provide insight into the financial burden that this CDI outbreak brought upon this hospital. A retrospective analysis was performed to estimate the costs of a one-year-long C. difficile ribotype 027 outbreak. Medical charts were reviewed for patient data. In addition, all costs associated with the outbreak control measures were collected. The attributable costs of the whole outbreak were estimated to be \u20ac1,222,376. The main contributing factor was missed revenue due to increased length of stay of CDI patients and closure of beds to enable contact isolation of CDI patients (36%). A second important cost component was extra surveillance and activities of the Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control (25%). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to provide insight into the attributable costs of CDI in an outbreak setting, and to delineate the major cost items.

METHODS The validation cohort comprised 148 patients diagnosed with CDI between May 2013 and March 2014. During this period, 70 endemic cases of CDI occurred as well as 78 cases of CDI related to an outbreak of C. difficile ribotype 027. Model calibration and discrimination were assessed for the 3 prediction rules. RESULTS A complicated course (ie, death, colectomy, or ICU admission due to CDI) was observed in 31 patients (21%), and 23 patients (16%) died within 30 days of CDI diagnosis. The performance of all 3 prediction models was poor when applied to the total validation cohort with an estimated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 for the Hensgens model, 0.54 for the Na model, and 0.61 for the Welfare model. For those patients diagnosed with CDI due to non-outbreak strains, the prediction model developed by Hensgens performed the best, with an AUC of 0.78. CONCLUSION All 3 prediction models performed poorly when using our total cohort, which included CDI cases from an outbreak as well as endemic cases. The prediction model of Hensgens performed relatively well for patients diagnosed with CDI due to non-outbreak strains, and this model may be useful in endemic settings.

This is a prospective study of all patients with CDI-027, from November 2014 to November 2015. The epidemiological data were collected daily for each patient. We compared clinical characteristics and treatment between patients with and without recurrence of CDI-027. Interestingly, liver cirrhosis was present in 22% of the patients, and most of them received prophylaxis for hepatic encephalopathy with rifaximin. Patients were also taking antimicrobial drugs (93.6%) and proton pump inhibitors (80.1%). Overall, 27 (23.5%) patients had a first recurrence of CDI-027. Liver cirrhosis increased the risk of recurrence (44.4% vs 14.8%).

Patients diagnosed with CDI due to other ribotypes were included as a second control group. A random selection of C. difficile ribotype 027 strains (n = 10) was genotyped by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). WGS showed the outbreak was likely caused by a single strain of C. difficile (two or less single-nucleotide variants between isolates). Ninety-five percent of cases had used antibiotics, compared to 56% of controls. Previous admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6), longer length of stay (LOS), and recent hospital admission were associated with CDI ribotype 027. Cases were less likely to have been admitted to a ward with a known isolated CDI patient (OR: 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Analysis of patients who stayed at the ICU (35 cases; 51 controls), indicated that the use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) and a longer LOS in the ICU were associated with CDI risk. In this large outbreak, any antibiotic use, including SDD use, appeared as a prerequisite for acquisition of the outbreak strain. The role of use of SDD and prolonged stay on the ICU could not be disentangled, but both factors can play a biologically plausible role in C. difficile acquisition and infection.",

Molecular typing of German isolates sent to the advisory laboratory between 2011 and 2013 revealed that ribotype 027 is present with high percentages in most German regions except for the very North. In conclusion, optimized testing of all hospitalized patients with diarrhea should be generally implemented to avoid under-diagnosis of C. difficile infection. Ribotype 027 is highly prevalent in Germany, but its infections are restricted to older patients, while absent in children. Molecular typing of suspected hospital outbreaks and of patients with severe or recurrent disease may help to better understand virulence and epidemic spreading of C. difficile.",

Two components of the RNA polymerase II machinery, Med13 (Srb9) and Spt8, were isolated as two-hybrid partners of the conserved TFIIS N-terminal domain. They belong to the Cdk8 module of the Mediator and to a subform of the SAGA co-activator, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TFIIS can bind the Cdk8 module and SAGA in cell-free extracts. spt8Delta and dst1Delta mutants were sensitive to nucleotide-depleting drugs and epistatic to null mutants of the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb9, suggesting that their elongation defects are mediated by Rpb9. rpb9Delta, spt8Delta and dst1Delta were lethal in cells lacking the Rpb4 subunit. The TFIIS N-terminal domain is also strictly required for viability in rpb4Delta, although it is not needed for binding to RNA polymerase II or for transcript cleavage. It is proposed that TFIIS and the Spt8-containing form of SAGA co-operate to rescue RNA polymerase II from unproductive elongation complexes, and that the Cdk8 module temporarily blocks transcription during transcript cleavage.",

This stimulatory activity of TFIIS, which is dependent upon Rpb9, facilitates the resumption of transcription elongation when the polymerase stalls or arrests. While TFIIS has a pronounced effect on transcription elongation in vitro, the deletion of DST1 has no major effect on cell viability. In this work we used a genetic approach to increase our knowledge of the role of TFIIS in vivo. We showed that: (1) dst1 and rpb9 mutants have a synthetic growth defective phenotype when combined with fyv4, gim5, htz1, yal011w, ybr231c, soh1, vps71, and vps72 mutants that is exacerbated during germination or at high salt concentrations; (2) TFIIS and Rpb9 are essential when the cells are challenged with microtubule-destabilizing drugs; (3) among the SDO (synthetic with Dst one), SOH1 shows the strongest genetic interaction with DST1; (4) the presence of multiple copies of TAF14, SUA7, GAL11, RTS1, and TYS1 alleviate the growth phenotype of dst1 soh1 mutants; and (5) SRB5 and SIN4 genetically interact with DST1.

Disruptions of PPR2 are lethal in conjunction with a disruption in the nonessential gene TAF14/TFG3. While investigating which of the Taf14p-containing complexes may be responsible for the synthetic lethality between ppr2Delta and taf14Delta, we discovered genetic interactions between PPR2 and both TFG1 and TFG2 encoding the two larger subunits of the TFIIF complex that also contains Taf14p. Mutant alleles of tfg1 or tfg2 that render cells cold sensitive have improved growth at low temperature in the absence of TFIIS. Remarkably, the amino-terminal 130 amino acids of TFIIS, which are dispensable for the known in vitro and in vivo activities of TFIIS, are required to complement the lethality in taf14Delta ppr2Delta cells. Analyses of deletion and chimeric gene constructs of PPR2 implicate contributions by different regions of this N-terminal domain. No strong common phenotypes were identified for the ppr2Delta and taf14Delta strains, implying that the proteins are not functionally redundant. Instead, the absence of Taf14p in the cell appears to create a dependence on an undefined function of TFIIS mediated by its N-terminal region. This region of TFIIS is also at least in part responsible for the deleterious effect of TFIIS on tfg1 or tfg2 cold-sensitive cells. Together, these results suggest a physiologically relevant functional connection between TFIIS and TFIIF.",

Recent studies revealed that TFIIS has also a role in Pol II transcription initiation. To improve our understanding of TFIIS function in vivo, we performed genome-wide location analysis of this factor. Under normal growth conditions, TFIIS was detected on Pol II-transcribed genes, and TFIIS occupancy was well correlated with that of Pol II, indicating that TFIIS recruitment is not restricted to NTP-depleted cells. Unexpectedly, TFIIS was also detected on almost all Pol III-transcribed genes. TFIIS and Pol III occupancies correlated well genome-wide on this novel class of targets. In vivo, some dst1 mutants were partly defective in tRNA synthesis and showed a reduced Pol III occupancy at the restrictive temperature. In vitro transcription assays suggested that TFIIS may affect Pol III start site selection.

Yeast cells do not require TFIIS for viability, unless they suffer severe transcriptional stress due to NTP-depleting drugs like 6-azauracil or mycophenolic acid. In order to broaden our knowledge on the role of TFIIS under transcriptional stress, we carried out a genetic screening for suppressors of TFIIS-lacking cells' sensitivity to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid. Five suppressors were identified, four of which were related to the transcriptional regulation of those genes encoding ribosomal components [rRNAs and ribosomal proteins (RP)], including global regulator SFP1. This led us to discover that RNA polymerase II is hypersensitive to the absence of TFIIS under NTP scarcity conditions when transcribing RP genes. The absence of Sfp1 led to a profound alteration of the transcriptional response to NTP-depletion, thus allowing the expression of RP genes to resist these stressful conditions in the absence of TFIIS. We discuss the effect of transcriptional stress on ribosome biogenesis and propose that TFIIS contributes to prevent a transcriptional imbalance between rDNA and RP genes.",

A site-directed mutagenesis of this dicarboxylic motif reveals its strictly essential character in RNA polymerase III, with a slightly less stringent pattern in RNA polymerase II, where rpb2-E836Q and other substitutions completely prevent growth, whereas rpb2-E836A combines a dominant growth defect with severe lethal sectoring. A mild but systematic increase in RNA polymerase occupancy and a strict dependency on the transcript cleavage factor TFIIS (Dst1) also suggest a slower rate of translocation or higher probability of transcriptional stalling in this mutation. A conserved nucleotide triphosphate funnel domain binds the Rpb2-(832)GYNQED(837) loop by an Rpb2-R(1020)/Rpb2-D(837) salt-bridge. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal a second bridge (Rpb1-K(752)/Rpb2-E(836)), which may account for the critical role of the invariant Rpb2-E(836).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20602769": " CpG islands and nucleosome-free regions are both found in promoters. However, their association has never been studied. On the other hand, DNA methylation is absent in promoters but is enriched in gene bodies. Intragenic nucleosomes and their modifications have been recently associated with RNA splicing. Because the function of intragenic DNA methylation remains unclear, I explored the possibility of its involvement in splicing regulation. Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island. However, the DNA sequences of CpG islands predicted the opposite pattern, implying a limitation of sequence programs for the determination of nucleosome occupancy. In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. Exon-enrichment of DNA methylation was specifically found in spliced exons and in exons with weak splice sites. The enrichment patterns were less pronounced in initial exons and in non-coding exons, potentially reflecting a lower need for their splicing. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23502848": "DNA methylation is known to regulate transcription and was recently found to be involved in exon recognition via cotranscriptional splicing. We recently observed that exon-intron architectures can be grouped into two classes: one with higher GC content in exons compared to the flanking introns, and the other with similar GC content in exons and introns. The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar. We find different and specific patterns of DNA methylation in each of the GC architectures; yet in both groups, DNA methylation clearly marks the exons. Exons of the leveled GC architecture exhibit a significantly stronger DNA methylation signal in relation to their flanking introns compared to exons of the differential GC architecture. This is accentuated by a reduction of the DNA methylation level in the intronic sequences in proximity to the splice sites and shows that different epigenetic modifications mark the location of exons already at the DNA level. Also, lower levels of methylated CpGs on alternative exons can successfully distinguish alternative exons from constitutive ones. Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture. Overall, these results suggest that DNA methylation affects exon recognition and is influenced by the GC architecture of the exon and flanking introns.",

Nucleosomes can determine the underlying DNA methylation status. Herein, we show that the opposite is also true: DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning. Using a cancer model and digital nucleosome positioning techniques, we demonstrate that the induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Most importantly, the establishment of a stable cell line that restores DNMT1/DNMT3B deficiency shows that nucleosomes reoccupy their positions in de novo methylated CpG islands. Finally, we extend these results to the genomic level, combining a DNA methylation microarray and the nucleosome positioning technique. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other.",

Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. We use the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as a model to address this question and determine that &lt;2% of regions demethylated by 5-Aza-CdR treatment assume an open configuration. Consolidating our findings, we detect nucleosome retention at sites of global DNA methylation loss in DKO1, an HCT116-derived non-tumorigenic cell-line engineered for DNA methyltransferase disruption. Notably, regions that are open in both HCT116 cells after treatment and in DKO1 cells include promoters belonging to tumor suppressors and genes under-expressed in colorectal cancers. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. Furthermore, we show that the chromatin opening induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid has strikingly distinct targets compared with those of 5-Aza-CdR, providing a mechanistic explanation for the importance of combinatorial therapy in eliciting maximal de-repression of the cancer epigenome.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26305225": "The fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome. Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24419148": "CpG islands (CGIs) are commonly used as genomic markers to study the patterns and regulatory consequences of DNA methylation. Interestingly, recent studies reveal a substantial diversity among CGIs: long and short CGIs, for example, exhibit contrasting patterns of gene expression complexity and nucleosome occupancy. Evolutionary origins of CGIs are also highly heterogeneous. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. We discover novel 'clusters' of CGIs according to their patterns of DNA methylation; the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster I), sperm-hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster II), and variably methylated CGI cluster (cluster III). These epigenomic CGI clusters are strikingly distinct at multiple biological features including genomic, evolutionary, and functional characteristics. At the genomic level, the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster tends to be longer and harbors many more CpG dinucleotides than those in other clusters. They are also frequently associated with promoters, while CGI clusters II and III mostly reside in intragenic or intergenic regions and exhibit highly tissue-specific DNA methylation. Functional ontology terms and transcriptional profiles co-vary with CGI clusters, indicating that the regulatory functions of CGIs are tightly linked to their heterogeneity. Finally, CGIs associated with distinctive biological processes, such as diseases, aging, and imprinting, occur disproportionately across CGI clusters. These new findings provide an effective means to combine existing knowledge on CGIs into a genomic context while bringing new insights that elucidate the significance of DNA methylation across different biological conditions and demography.",

Here, we have dissected the linkages between DNA methylation (5mC), hydroxymethylation (5hmC), nucleosome repositioning, and binding of the transcription factor CTCF during this process. By integrating MNase-seq and ChIP-seq experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their differentiated counterparts with biophysical modeling, we found that the interplay between these factors depends on their genomic context. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. The few remaining methylated CpG dinucleotides are preferentially associated with nucleosomes. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Outside CpG islands, binding of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5mC to 5hmC, is associated with labile, MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. Such nucleosomes are poised for eviction in ESCs and become stably bound in differentiated cells where the TET1 and 5hmC levels go down. This process regulates a class of CTCF binding sites outside CpG islands that are occupied by CTCF in ESCs but lose the protein during differentiation. We rationalize this cell type-dependent targeting of CTCF with a quantitative biophysical model of competitive binding with the histone octamer, depending on the TET1, 5hmC, and 5mC state.",

As with many other psychiatric disorders, a genetic basis for depression has been identified. Evidence for the role of circadian genes in depression is particularly compelling. Circadian gene mutations are also associated with circadian rhythm disorders such as familial advanced sleep phase syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome. Such disorders, plus the other manifestations of a disrupted circadian system such as hormone dysregulation, are often observed among those with depression. This suggests a shared aetiology between circadian disruption and depression, although the exact mechanisms underlying the association are unclear. This paper reviews the molecular mechanisms involved in depression, with an emphasis on circadian genes. Twin studies in depression have reported probandwise concordance rates of 40% and 70% using narrow and broad diagnostic criteria, respectively, and heritability of over 85% for bipolar disorder. In association studies, increased susceptibility to depression has been noted in those with polymorphisms in the following: D-amino-acid-oxidase activator/G30 gene complex, glucocorticoid receptor gene, serotonin transporter gene, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene, dopamine transporter gene and G protein-coupled receptor 50 gene. Polymorphisms in these genes have also been linked to a better or worse response to antidepressant therapy, an increased likelihood of responding poorly to adversity and increased suicide ideation. Polymorphisms in the CLOCK, BMAL1, Per3 and TIMELESS genes have been associated with susceptibility to mood disorder, and single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in several circadian genes have been observed among those displaying certain circadian phenotypes, including worse mood in the evening, insomnia in mania and early, middle or late insomnia in depression. Manipulation of the circadian timing system via sleep deprivation, bright light or pharmacological therapy has also been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms, providing further evidence for the role of circadian dysfunction in depression pathophysiology. The new antidepressant agomelatine is the first melatonergic antidepressant with an innovative mode of action: it is a melatonergic MT(1), MT(2) receptor agonist and 5-HT(2c) antagonist, and is able to restore the internal clock, which is profoundly disturbed in depression, thus being efficacious in major depressive disorders. In conclusion, a wealth of evidence is now available supporting a genetic basis for depression. The apparent importance of mutations in the circadian genes in determining disease susceptibility, disease recurrence and response to treatment suggests that the circadian pathway represents an attractive target for pharmacological manipulation to improve management of this debilitating disorder.",

Sumoylation of the caspase recruitment domains of MDA5 and RIG-I is also required for their dephosphorylation by PP1 and activation upon viral infection. At the late phase of viral infection, both MDA5 and RIG-I are desumoylated by SENP2, resulting in their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. These findings suggest that dynamic sumoylation and desumoylation of MDA5 and RIG-I modulate efficient innate immunity to RNA virus and its timely termination.",

Tulane virus (TV) is the prototype virus of a tentative new genus, Recovirus, in the family Caliciviridae. Its epidemiology and biological properties most closely resemble human norovirus. The host innate immune response to RNA virus infection primarily involves pathogen-sensing toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR3 and TLR7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5). In this study, by using siRNA knockdown, we report that TV infection in LLC-MK2 cells results in an early [3 h post infection (h p.i.), P&lt;0.05] RIG-I-dependent and type I interferon-mediated antiviral response, whereas an MDA5-mediated antiviral effect was observed at later (12 h p.i.; P&lt;0.05) stages of TV replication. Induction of RIG-I and MDA5 was critical for inhibition of TV replication. Furthermore, pre-activation of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway prevented TV replication (&gt;900-fold decrease; P&lt;0.05), suggesting that RIG-I and MDA5 ligands could be used to develop novel preventive and therapeutic measures against norovirus.",

Nucleic acids including RNA and DNA have been recognized as very important PAMPs of pathogens especially for viruses. RNA are the major PAMPs of RNA viruses, to which most severe disease causing viruses belong thus posing a tougher challenge to human and animal health. Therefore, the understanding of the immune biology of RNA PRRs is critical for control of pathogen infections especially for RNA virus infections. RNA PRRs are comprised of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, NOD2, and some other minorities. This review introduces these RNA PRRs by describing the cellular localizations, ligand recognitions, activation mechanisms, cell signaling pathways, and recognition of pathogens; the cross-talks between various RNA PRRs are also reviewed.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29069650": "Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and initiates rapid innate antiviral responses. MDA5 forms a filament-like multimer along the dsRNA leading to oligomerization, which in turn activates the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to provide a signal platform for the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. The conformational switch of MDA5 causes antiviral defense, but excessive activation of the MDA5-MAVS pathway may result in autoimmune diseases. The regulatory mechanisms of MDA5 activation remain largely unknown. By yeast 2-hybrid, we identified DNAJB1, a member of the HSP40 (heat shock protein 40) family, as an MDA5-binding protein. HSP40s usually cowork with HSP70s. We found that dsRNA stimulation with physiological conditions upregulated the expression levels of DNAJB1 and HSP70; then the proteins were coupled and translocated into the stress granules, where MDA5 encounters dsRNA. DNAJB1 disrupted MDA5 multimer formation, resulting in the suppression of type I IFN induction. The disruption of endogenous DNAJB1 increased MDA5- and MAVS-mediated IFN promoter activation and rendered cells virus resistant. HSP70 inhibitor also enhanced the IFN-inducing function of MDA5 and MAVS. These results suggest that the DNAJB1-HSP70 complex functions for the natural maintenance of RNA sensing by interacting with MDA5/MAVS.",

Thus, the expression and activation of RLRs play fundamental roles in eliminating the invading RNA viruses and maintaining immune homeostasis. However, how RLR expression is tightly regulated remains to be further investigated. In this study, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded gene, tripartite interaction motif 40 (TRIM40), as a suppressor of RLR signaling by directly targeting MDA5 and RIG-I. TRIM40 binds to MDA5 and RIG-I and promotes their K27- and K48-linked polyubiquitination via its E3 ligase activity, leading to their proteasomal degradation. TRIM40 deficiency enhances RLR-triggered signaling. Consequently, TRIM40 deficiency greatly enhances antiviral immune responses and decreases viral replication in vivo. Thus, we demonstrate that TRIM40 limits RLR-triggered innate activation, suggesting TRIM40 as a potential therapeutic target for the control of viral infection.",

These proteins share eight conserved amino acid motifs, including Asp(D)-Glu-(E)-Ala(A)-Asp(D) which is part of a more extended motif. Recently, we have shown that the novel DDX1 gene containing a DEAD box motif maps to the same chromosome band as MYCN at 2p24 and is co-amplified with MYCN in retinoblastoma cell lines. Here, we show that the DDX1 gene is co-amplified with the MYCN gene in 2 of three neuroblastoma cell lines and that DDX1 RNA levels correlate with DDX1 gene copy number. Since amplification of MYCN is an indicator of poor prognosis in neuroblastoma, it was of interest to determine whether co-amplification with DDX1 occurred in clinical samples of neuroblastoma and whether such a finding carried any additional prognostic significance. We determined the gene copy number of DDX1 in 32 neuroblastoma patient samples (representative of all stages): 13 were MYCN amplified and 19 had normal copy numbers of the MYCN gene. Of the 13 neuroblastomas that were MYCN amplified, seven were also DDX1 amplified. Of the 19 that were not MYCN amplified, none were DDX1 amplified. This is the first example of a gene that is co-amplified with MYCN at a high frequency in neuroblastoma. While there was a trend towards a worse clinical outcome with co-amplification, the numbers were too small to reach significance.",

Given the recently established links between the gut microbiota and inflammatory diseases, we hypothesized that the AH8.1 influences the host gut microbial community composition. To study this further, healthy individuals were selected from the Norwegian Bone Marrow Donor Registry and categorized as either I. AH8.1 homozygote (n=34), II. AH8.1 heterozygote (n=38), III. Non AH8.1 heterozygote or IV. HLA-DRB1 homozygote but non AH8.1 (n=15). Bacterial DNA from stool samples were subjected to sequencing of the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene on the 454 Life Sciences platform and data analyzed using Mothur and QIIME. The results showed that the abundances of different taxa were highly variable within all pre-defined AH8.1 genotype groups. Using univariate non-parametric statistics, there were no differences regarding alpha or beta diversity between AH8.1 carriers (categories I and II) and non-carriers (categories III and IV), however four different taxa (Prevotellaceae, Clostridium XVIII, Coprococcus, Enterorhabdus) had nominally significant lower abundances in AH8.1 carriers than non-carriers. After including possible confounders in a multivariate linear regression, only the two latter genera remained significantly associated.

Six healthy adults ingested 2 servings of PFM daily for 3 wk, and their fecal microbiota were analyzed before and after 3 wk of PFM ingestion period and for another 3 wk following the termination of PFM ingestion (the noningestion period). Fecal microbial communities were characterized by sequencing of the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. All subjects showed a similar pattern of microbiota at the phylum level, where the relative abundance of Bacteriodetes species increased during the PFM ingestion period and decreased during the noningestion period. The increase in Bacteroidetes was found to be due to an increase in members of the families Bacteroidaceae or Prevotellaceae. In contrast to PFM-induced adaptation at the phylum level, the taxonomic composition at the genus level showed a considerable alteration in fecal microbiota induced by PFM ingestion. As revealed by analysis of operational taxonomic units (OTU), the numbers of shared OTU were low among the 3 different treatments (before, during, and after PFM ingestion), but the abundance of the shared OTU was relatively high, indicating that the majority (&gt;77.8%) of total microbiota was maintained by shared OTU during PFM ingestion and after its termination.

Despite its importance in maintaining the health of the host, growing evidence suggests the gut microbiota may also be an important factor in the pathogenesis of various diseases, a number of which have shown a rapid increase in incidence over the past few decades. Factors including age, genetics, and diet may influence microbiota composition. We used diet inventories and 16S rDNA sequencing to characterize fecal samples from 98 individuals. Fecal communities clustered into previously described enterotypes distinguished primarily by levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella. Enterotypes were associated with long-term diets, particularly protein and animal fat (Bacteroides) vs. simple carbohydrates (Prevotella). Although the distinction of enterotypes as either discrete clusters or a continuum will require additional investigation, numerous studies have demonstrated the co-exclusion of the closely related Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides genera in the gut microbiota of healthy human subjects where Prevotella appears to be a discriminatory taxon for residence in more agrarian societies. Ultimately, the impact of diet on the human gut microbiota may be an important environmental factor involved in the pathogenesis of disease states that show a rapidly increasing incidence in industrialized nations such as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).",

We performed a metatranscriptomic study on ten healthy volunteers to elucidate the active members of the gut microbiome and their functionality under conditions of health.

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that although the Bacteria in the human intestinal community were highly diverse, they fell mainly into 6 bacterial divisions that had distinct differences in the 3 study groups. Specifically, Firmicutes were dominant in normal-weight and obese individuals but significantly decreased in post-gastric-bypass individuals, who had a proportional increase of Gammaproteobacteria. Numbers of the H(2)-producing Prevotellaceae were highly enriched in the obese individuals. Unlike the highly diverse Bacteria, the Archaea comprised mainly members of the order Methanobacteriales, which are H(2)-oxidizing methanogens. Using real-time PCR, we detected significantly higher numbers of H(2)-utilizing methanogenic Archaea in obese individuals than in normal-weight or post-gastric-bypass individuals. The coexistence of H(2)-producing bacteria with relatively high numbers of H(2)-utilizing methanogenic Archaea in the gastrointestinal tract of obese individuals leads to the hypothesis that interspecies H(2) transfer between bacterial and archaeal species is an important mechanism for increasing energy uptake by the human large intestine in obese persons. The large bacterial population shift seen in the post-gastric-bypass individuals may reflect the double impact of the gut alteration caused by the surgical procedure and the consequent changes in food ingestion and digestion.",

One or more proteins from each complex are known to bind pol II via the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit, Rpb1. How binding is coordinated is not known, but it might involve conformational changes in the CTD induced by the Ess1 peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase. Here, we examined the role of ESS1 in transcription by studying one of its multicopy suppressors, BYE1. We found that Bye1 is a negative regulator of transcription elongation. This led to the finding that Ess1 also inhibits elongation; Ess1 opposes elongation factors Dst1 and Spt4/5, and overexpression of ESS1 makes cells more sensitive to the elongation inhibitor 6-AU. In reporter gene assays, ess1 mutations reduce the ability of elongation-arrest sites to stall polymerase. We also show that Ess1 acts positively in transcription termination, independent of its role in elongation. We propose that Ess1-induced conformational changes attenuate pol II elongation and help coordinate the ordered assembly of protein complexes on the CTD. In this way, Ess1 might regulate the transition between multiple steps of transcription.",

However, deletion of DST1, the gene encoding the yeast homolog of TFIIS, had only a small effect on transcriptional fidelity, as determined by this assay. In contrast, strains containing a deletion of RPB9, which encodes a small core subunit of Pol II, were found to engage in error-prone transcription. rpb9Delta strains also had increased steady-state levels of can1-100 mRNA, consistent with transcriptional errors that decrease the normal sensitivity of the can1-100 transcript to nonsense-mediated decay, a pathway that degrades mRNAs with premature stop codons.

Anticoagulation for 3 months is advised in patients with provoked DVT or PE, high risk of bleeding, and isolated distal or upper extremity DVT. In patients with unprovoked PE or proximal DVT and a low risk of bleeding, who want to stop anticoagulation after 3 months, further risk stratification is necessary. Clinical scoring system, and thrombophilia testing otherwise not routinely performed, may be considered to measure risk of annual recurrence in such cases. Short-term anticoagulation may be considered in subsegmental PE and superficial vein thrombosis, particularly if patients are at low risk of bleeding and have persistent risk factors for recurrent VTE. In cases of catheter-associated thrombosis, the catheter need not be removed routinely, and the patient may be anticoagulated for 3 months or longer if the catheter is maintained in patients with cancer.

Subjects within each dose group were randomised 3:1 to idarucizumab or placebo. A total of 110 randomised subjects received study drug (27 placebo, 83 idarucizumab). Peak and total exposure to idarucizumab increased proportionally with dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were achieved near the end of infusion, followed by a rapid decline, with an initial idarucizumab half-life of ~45 minutes. For the 5-minute infusions, this resulted in a reduction of plasma concentrations to less than 5 % of peak within 4 hours. Idarucizumab (in the absence of dabigatran) had no effect on coagulation parameters or endogenous thrombin potential. Overall adverse event (AE) frequency was similar for idarucizumab and placebo, and no relationship with idarucizumab dose was observed. Drug-related AEs (primary endpoint) were rare (occurring in 2 placebo and 3 idarucizumab subjects) and were mostly of mild intensity; none of them resulted in study discontinuation. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic profile of idarucizumab meets the requirement for rapid peak exposure and rapid elimination, with no effect on pharmacodynamic parameters. Idarucizumab was safe and well tolerated in healthy males.",

A literature search was conducted consisting of a PubMed database using the MeSH term idarucizumab and the key word dabigatran antidote. Studies evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran were included. Idarucizumab represents a novel treatment option as it is the only humanized, monoclonal antibody fragment that specifically binds to dabigatran. Studies evaluating reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation have demonstrated immediate, complete, and sustained effects with idarucizumab. Idarucizumab did not overcorrect thrombin generation. Additionally, evaluations have shown that dabigatran can be safely reinitiated 24 hours after the administration of idarucizumab. The United States Food and Drug Administration granted priority review for the biologic license application and accelerated approval for idarucizumab. Idarucizumab represents an encouraging development in the reversal of dabigatran. Its novel mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and lack of thrombotic events contribute positively to its use in patients who experience bleeding or for those who require emergent surgery or procedures.",

By reversing the anticoagulating effect of dabigatran etexilate with idarucizumab (Praxbind), patients presenting with an acute ischemic stroke can now be eligible for thrombolysis. We describe our experience with idarucizumab in a 71-year-old male patient pretreated with dabigatran etexilate. The patient arrived with a hemiparesis, central facial palsy, and dysarthria. Dabigatran etexilate was antagonized with idarucizumab, approximately 2.5 hours after the patient's last dose. Immediately after the infusion of idarucizumab, the patient received thrombolytic therapy. The hemiparesis and the central facial palsy were fully remitted 3 days after the onset of symptoms, and the dysarthria was remitted 2 days afterwards. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are widely used for the prevention of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran etexilate is an oral thrombin inhibitor that can be reversed by idarucizumab. Idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment, directly binds dabigatran etexilate and neutralizes its activity. Reversal of dabigatran etexilate using idarucizumab was safe and successful with no recombinant tissue plasminogen activator interactions.",

Therapy with hemostatic agents (e.g. factor VIIa and tranexamic acid) if started early after bleeding onset may reduce hematoma expansion, but their clinical effectiveness has not been shown. Rapid anticoagulation reversal with prothrombin concentrates (PCC) plus vitamin K is the first choice in vitamin K antagonist-related ICH. In ICH related to dabigatran, anticoagulation can be rapidly reversed with idarucizumab. PCC are recommended for ICH related to FXa inhibitors, whereas specific reversal agents are not yet approved. While awaiting ongoing trials studying minimally invasive approaches or hemicraniectomy, the role of surgery in ICH remains to be defined. Therapies targeting downstream molecular cascades in order to prevent secondary neuronal damage are promising, but the complexity and multi-phased nature of ICH pathophysiology is challenging. Finally, in addition to blood pressure control, antithrombotic prevention after ICH has to consider the risk of recurrent bleeding as well as the risk of ischemic events. Treatment of acute ICH remains challenging, and many promising interventions for acute ICH await further evidence from trials.",

Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary end point was the restoration of hemostasis. This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100% (95% confidence interval, 100 to 100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98% of the patients, an effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79% of the patients. Among 35 patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been reinitiated. Idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within minutes.

For patients who present with an acute stroke despite dabigatran therapy, clinical data on the use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) is limited. There is an anticipated increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) when using IV-tPA in patients on dabigatran therapy. In 2015, the humanized monoclonal antibody fragment idarucizumab was approved for rapid (minutes) reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. Dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab before administration of IV-tPA might reduce the risk of sICH. We report a case of a 69-year-old stroke patient on dabigatran for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented with an initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 12. There was no early evidence of ischemic stroke or hemorrhage on head computed tomography, and coagulation studies implied therapeutic dabigatran levels. After controlling blood pressure, dabigatran was reversed with idarucizumab, and IV-tPA was administrated beginning 197 minutes after he was last seen at his baseline. Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging showed 2 punctate infarcts in the left temporal lobe and occipital lobe with no evidence of hemorrhage. The patient was discharged with an NIHSS of 1. Telephone follow-up 2 months later indicated that he was at his prestroke baseline, except for a complaint of worsened short-term memory. Idarucizumab reversal of dabigatran may reduce the risk of sICH and should be considered for acute stroke patients arriving in the IV-tPA time window.",

The coagulopathy induced by VKAs can be reversed with vitamin K, and in urgent situations, the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors can be replaced by transfusion. In the last decade, a new class of oral anticoagulants has been developed, direct oral anticoagulants that bind to a specific coagulation factor and neutralize it. These compounds were shown to be effective and safe compared with the VKAs and were licensed for specific indications, but without a specific reversal agent. The absence of a reversal agent is a barrier to more widespread use of these agents. Currently, for the management of major life-threatening bleeding with the direct oral anticoagulants, most authorities recommend the use of four factor prothrombin complex concentrates. There are now three reversal agents in development and poised to enter the market. Idarucizumab is a specific antidote targeted to reverse the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, which was recently approved for use in the USA.

This study assessed the ability of three- and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and idarucizumab (specific antidote for dabigatran) to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a porcine model of trauma. Twelve animals were given dabigatran etexilate (DE) orally and dabigatran intravenously, before infliction of trauma. Six animals received tranexamic acid plus fibrinogen concentrate 12 minutes post-injury. Six PCCs (each 30 and 60 U/kg) and idarucizumab (30 and 60 mg/kg) were added to blood samples ex vivo. Coagulation was assessed by several coagulation assays. All coagulation parameters were altered after dabigatran infusion (plasma level: 442 \u00b1 138 ng/ml). Both three- and four-factor PCCs mostly or completely reversed the effects of dabigatran on thromboelastometry variables and PT but not on aPTT. Idarucizumab neutralised plasma concentrations of dabigatran, and reversed the effects of the drug on coagulation variables. Thrombin generation showed dose-dependent over-correction following the addition of PCC, implying that elevated levels of thrombin are required to overcome dabigatran-induced coagulopathy. In contrast, treatment with idarucizumab returned thrombin generation to baseline levels. Following trauma, therapy with tranexamic acid plus fibrinogen improved correction of coagulation parameters by PCC, and thromboelastometry parameters by idarucizumab. All investigated PCCs improved dabigatran- and trauma-induced coagulopathy to a similar degree. In conclusion, this study shows that three- and four-factor PCCs are similarly effective for dabigatran reversal. Idarucizumab also reversed the effects of dabigatran and, unlike PCCs, was not associated with over-correction of thrombin generation.",

Here we present the results of the proof-of-concept part of the study. In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, proof-of-concept phase 1 study, we enrolled healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) with a body-mass index of 18\u00b75-29\u00b79 kg/m(2) into one of four dose groups at SGS Life Sciences Clinical Research Services, Belgium. Participants were randomly assigned within groups in a 3:1 ratio to idarucizumab or placebo using a pseudorandom number generator and a supplied seed number. Participants and care providers were masked to treatment assignment. All participants received oral dabigatran etexilate 220 mg twice daily for 3 days and a final dose on day 4. Idarucizumab (1 g, 2 g, or 4 g 5-min infusion, or 5 g plus 2\u00b75 g in two 5-min infusions given 1 h apart) was administered about 2 h after the final dabigatran etexilate dose. The primary endpoint was incidence of drug-related adverse events, analysed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of dabigatran etexilate. Reversal of diluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT) were secondary endpoints assessed by measuring the area under the effect curve from 2 h to 12 h (AUEC2-12) after dabigatran etexilate ingestion on days 3 and 4.

Until the FDA approval of idarucizumab, there had been no reversal agent for dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in patients with life-threatening or uncontrollable bleeding, or those requiring emergent procedures. The primary purpose of this review is to summarize the safety and efficacy of idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment, and its use as a reversal agent for dabigatran. A literature search was conducted through MEDLINE (1946 to November week 1 2015) and Embase (1980-2015 week 46) using the search term idarucizumab. Clinicaltrials.gov was consulted for a comprehensive list of ongoing and completed studies. Additional studies were identified through bibliographical citations. Clinical trials in animals and humans published in English evaluating the safety and efficacy of idarucizumab for reversal of anticoagulant treatment with dabigatran were included for review. Idarucizumab has been shown to significantly reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in both healthy volunteers and patients requiring a reversal agent because of either overt bleeding or an emergency surgery or invasive procedure. The most common AEs were headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, skin irritation, hypokalemia, delirium, constipation, pyrexia, and pneumonia. Deaths reported in idarucizumab studies were attributed to either the index event or a preexisting comorbidity. Most adverse effects were minor, but 21 serious AEs have been reported in the published data including thrombotic events. Given the increased use of direct oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, a need for specific reversal agents exists. Idarucizumab has been shown to be safe and effective in the reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in patients requiring emergent or urgent surgery or in patients with severe bleeding.",

Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR."
