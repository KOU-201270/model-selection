This review describes associations between sporadic GIST and second malignancies, as well as new contributions to our knowledge about hereditary GIST multiple tumor syndromes. Sporadic GIST patients have increased risk of developing synchronous/metachronous cancers, including nonhematologic and hematologic malignancies. Data suggest these associations are nonrandom, more prevalent in men and increase with age. New adrenal tumors have also been associated with nonhereditary Carney's triad. Meanwhile, understanding of the molecular basis of heritable GIST syndromes has improved. Several new familial GIST kindreds have been reported, including those with germline KIT and PDGFR\u03b1 mutations. Knowledge about succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency and mutations in hereditary GIST syndromes has expanded. It is now known that neurofibromatosis-1-associated GISTs are SDHB-positive, whereas Carney-Stratakis syndrome-associated GISTs are SDHB-deficient with underlying germline mutations in SDH subunits A-D. Recognition and early diagnosis of GIST syndromes allows for improved comprehensive medical care. With additional understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of GIST multiple tumor syndromes, we can refine our screening programs and management of these patients and their families.",

Surgery was selected to make a definite diagnosis. Thoracoscopic segmentectomy of right segments 9 and 10 was performed, and pulmonary chondroma was diagnosed. Carney designated the combination of 3 rare soft tissue tumors (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma) as a syndrome. This patient may have had an incomplete type of Carney's triad with 2 lesions in the stomach and lung.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22968735": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors in the digestive tract. In up to 90% of cases, they are characterized by activating mutations in the KIT or the PDGFRA gene. GIST represent a paradigm for successful targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Since the approval of the TKI imatinib in 2002 the survival of patients with metastatic GIST has tripled. The next logical step was the concept of using imatinib in an adjuvant approach, which was recently shown to increase overall survival significantly. In both settings, the mutational status has high predictive implications. In detail, GIST with KIT exon 11 mutations show the best response rates with partial remission rates of up to 80%. In KIT exon 9 mutations, a doubled daily dose of 800 mg imatinib is now standard. The PDGFRA exon 18 mutation D842V has been shown to lead to primary resistance. The treatment strategy in GIST is driven by their molecular characterisation. Further research has increased our knowledge on resistance mechanisms in solid tumors against TKI. The number of patients with secondary resistance due to acquired KIT mutations is increasing with treatment duration. Strategies to address this situation are the introduction of novel pathway inhibitors targeting different levels of signal transduction pathways, such as the mTOR/Akt pathway, the RAS/RAF pathway, histone deacetylation, among others. Among the GIST without mutations in the common hot spot regions of KIT and PDGFRA, the so-called wildtype GIST, further genomic subgroups have been identified. One such subgroup carries inactivating germline mutations in the genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase B, C, or D. They are associated with the occurrence of paragangliomas, so-called Carney-Stratakis syndrome. Most frequently, these GIST are located in the stomach, showing an epithelioid phenotype and a multinodular growth pattern. They preferentially occur in young females and often show lymph node metastases, the latter being very unusual in sporadic GIST. In sporadic Carney's triad additional pulmonary chondromas are observed and there are no SDH mutations. Another small subgroup of sporadic GIST present with BRAF mutations as an alternative genomic event. Finally, very rare kindreds with germline mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA have been described who develop multiple GIST and depending on the mutational subtype mastocytosis, hyperpigmentation and/or dysphagia. In summary, the molecular characterisation of GIST has revolutionized their treatment due to increasing knowledge about the high relevance of predictive molecular typing in solid tumors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22664948": "We report a case of pulmonary bilateral multiple chondromas that were possibly an initial clinical presentation of Carney's triad. A 56-year-old Japanese non-smoking asymptomatic woman was admitted to the hospital for further examination of small, multiple, bilateral nodules in the lungs. Although chest radiological findings suggested that the nodules were possibly metastatic pulmonary tumors, the malignant origin was not detected. During diagnostic video-assisted thoracic surgery, wedge resections including the nodules were performed. Since pathological examination showed nodules were surrounded by fibrous and eosinophilic stroma, we diagnose the nodules as chondromas. These chondromas were possibly components of Carney's triad, because each nodule had a thin fibrous pseudocapsule and did not have an entrapped epithelium and fat. Some patients die of Carney's triad because of malignant alteration of lesions. Therefore, the patients with Carney's triad should be taken a medical check periodically. This patient was scheduled to undergo the check-up for several years.",

The incidence of sporadic ICC hyperplasia and the so-called seedling leiomyoma (SLM) of the lower oesophagus has not been studied in the KIT era. In a retrospective review of 77 consecutive, routinely processed oesophagogastric resection specimens for distal oesophageal carcinoma, we found foci of ICC hyperplasia in 7 of 77 (9.1%) cases and foci of SLM in 17 of 77 (22%) cases. Two types of ICC hyperplasia were recognized: a non-circumscribed type and a nodular expansile type with peripherally compressed myenteric neural tissues. All cases of ICC hyperplasia were vimentin+/CD34+/CD117+. SLMs were desmin+/vimentin(-)/CD34(-)/CD117(-), similar to smooth muscles of the gut wall. In a prospective study of 32 non-carcinomatous specimens from age-matched patients (mostly autopsy cases), we found SLMs in only one case, but we were unable to detect ICC hyperplasia in any of the cases. We concluded that sporadic KIT-positive spindle-cell hyperplasia and SLMs were unexpectedly common in distal oesophageal specimens harbouring carcinomas. The possible mechanisms leading to the development of these putative precursor lesions will be discussed.",

We remark that multiple gastric tumors in a young adult suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) Endoscopic biopsy frequently is not effective because these tumors are deep placed in the muscular gastric layers. The importance of specific techniques for a positive diagnosis are emphasized. Continuous follow up is needed because these tumors have uncertain prognosis. Lung chondromas may appear years later after the GIST was removed and might be confused with GIST metastases.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16142610": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) occur mostly as sporadic solitary lesions involving the tubular GI tract and are only rarely associated with other benign or malignant neoplasms or occur as part of a multi-neoplastic disease as in the setting of Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease. We analysed a total of 97 cases of surgically resected GIST looking for various types of associated non-GIST malignancies. 18 cases (18.6 %) were identified. There were 12 women and 6 men aged 43 to 87, average age 71.7 years. 12 GISTs were located in the stomach, four in the small intestine, and one each in the duodenum and the vermiform appendix. Associated malignancies (mostly carcinomas) were gastrointestinal/pancreatic (9), gynaecological (3), mammary (2), renal (1), prostatic (1), pulmonary (2) and haematolymphoid (2) in origin. Most GISTs (16/18) represented benign or low-risk lesions (innocent bystanders) detected during evaluation for the known cancer, either during staging, intra-operatively or on follow-up. Two women (43 and 72 years old) with large malignant GISTs (10.5 and 12 cm), one of them with two simultaneous hepatic metastases resected at the same time as the primary GIST, developed infiltrating ductal mammary carcinoma and were alive and well 75 and 95 months postoperatively, respectively. Furthermore, one of them developed endometrial carcinoma. We concluded that GISTs are not uncommonly encountered in cancer-patients during staging, intraoperatively or on follow-up and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of newly detected focal lesions to avoid their misinterpretation as metastasis from the known malignancy with consequently false therapeutic decisions.",

One child, presenting atypically with papilledema and fundal hemorrhages from malignant hypertension and benign intracranial hypertension from chronic iron-deficiency anemia, is the second patient ever to date be described with the complete Carney's triad of neoplasms at diagnosis. Another child presented more typically with gastric stromal sarcoma and pulmonary chondroma without paraganglioma. Carney's triad is a rare differential diagnosis for \"idiopathic\" hypertension or iron-deficiency anemia from chronic gastrointestinal bleeding.

The gastric tumor resembled a gastric leiomyosarcoma by light microscopy, but electron microscopy revealed it to be a gastric autonomic nerve (GAN) tumor. Based on this evidence it appears that both the gastric lesions and the paragangliomata of Carney's Triad are tumors of the autonomic nervous system.

MRI is as effective as MIBG scintigraphy in detecting functioning paragangliomas. In the evaluation of suspected cases of Carney's triad in which there is clinical and biochemical evidence of a paraganglioma, MRI is the modality of choice for screening and follow-up.

To date, 28 patients with at least two of these individually unusual or rare neoplasms have been described. This updated case report of one of the originally described patients with Carney's triad highlights several clinically important features of this unusual syndrome: (1) the multicentricity of both the paragangliomas and the epithelioid leiomyosarcomas, (2) the often indolent progression of metastatic leiomyosarcoma, (3) the potential for late recurrences, and (4) the importance of distinguishing intra-adrenal from periadrenal catecholamine-producing tumors (paragangliomas). Localization of paragangliomas is facilitated by two relatively new techniques--131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning (a scintigraphic technique with high specificity for catecholamine-producing tumors) and two-dimensional echocardiography (which can noninvasively localize and demonstrate the anatomic relationships of aorticopulmonary paragangliomas). In patients with this syndrome, new or recurrent tumors frequently manifest after unusually long asymptomatic intervals. We outline an approach for continued follow-up of patients with one or more of the three neoplasms that constitute the syndrome. Rigorous long-term screening of these patients should not only lead to early recognition and resection of recurrent or new tumors but also enhance our understanding of this intriguing syndrome.",

We report the clinical course of a female with the complete triad and some additional tumors. Bilateral vagal paragangliomas were treated surgically and with radiotherapy between the ages of 24 and 26 years. Subsequently she underwent surgery for a gastric leiomyosarcoma (27 years), a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland (49 years) and a multifocal breast cancer with axillary spread (50 years). A calcified lesion was also noticed in the left lung, the radiologic diagnosis of which was consistent with chondroma. A mediastinal paraganglioma, detected at 56 years on a control X-ray of the chest, was partially excised at 63 years. At the last control, performed at 66 years, the patient was alive with residual cervical and mediastinal paraganglioma. Her younger brother was affected by Hirschsprung's disease and died at 54 years of rectal cancer. Her daughter is 33 and has been suffering since birth with severe constipation. In conclusion, this is one of the longest followed-up patients with Carney's triad. Her case illustrates the need for early recognition of the setting in order to detect the component tumors at a stage when surgery may be curative, and careful and life-long follow-up, both because the multicentricity of the classic components tends to manifest metachronously and because of the tendency to develop other tumors, some of which may be malignant. Furthermore, the presence of Hirschsprung's disease in the patient's family, coupled with the alleged common origin of two component lesions from derivatives of the neural crest, open new avenues for the understanding of this disorder.",

Secondary analysis. One hundred sixteen general practices in the Netherlands. Community-dwelling individuals aged 70 to 78 (N = 2,994). Nurse-led multidomain intervention targeting cardiovascular risk factors to prevent dementia. The associations between participant baseline sociodemographic (age, sex, education), clinical (medical history, disability, cardiovascular risk), neuropsychiatric (depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale-15), and cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination)) characteristics and dropout from the trial and nonadherence to the trial intervention were explored using multilevel logistic regression models. Older age, poorer cognitive function, more symptoms of depression, and greater disability were the most important determinants of dropout of older people. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors was not associated with dropout but was associated with nonadherence. Being overweight was a risk factor for nonadherence, whereas people with high blood pressure or a low level of physical exercise adhered better to the intervention. The association between poorer cognitive function and symptoms of depression and dropout was stronger in the control group than in the intervention group, and vice versa for increased disability. In a large dementia prevention trial with 6-year follow-up, dropout was associated with older age, poorer cognitive function, symptoms of depression, and disability at baseline. These findings can help to guide the design of future dementia prevention trials in older adults. The associations found between cardiovascular risk factors and nonadherence need to be confirmed in other older populations receiving cardiovascular prevention interventions.",

General practices within each health-care centre were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation sequence, to either a 6-year nurse-led, multidomain cardiovascular intervention or control (usual care).

We designed a large cluster-randomized trial with a 6-year follow-up in 3700 elderly subjects (70 to 78 y) to assess whether nurse-led intensive vascular care in primary care decreases the incidence of dementia and reduces disability. Secondary outcome parameters are mortality, incidence of vascular events, and cognitive functioning. Intensive vascular care comprises treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and reducing overweight, smoking cessation, and stimulating physical exercise. Baseline data of 1004 subjects show that 87% of the subjects have 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors and 44% have even 2 or more risk factors amenable to treatment. Seventy-nine percent of the subjects receiving antihypertensive medication still have a systolic pressure of &gt;140 mm Hg.

In addition, DAPA shows beneficial/neutral effects on other risk factors contributing to T2DM metabolic control. Increased risk of genital and urinary infections and episodes of volume depletion represent the major concerns for its use. FDA requires additional data to assess imbalances in bladder cancer and drug cardiovascular safety. The mechanism of action and the very low risk of drug-drug interaction make it an ideal drug for rapidly reducing glucotoxicity and restoring clinical response to other antidiabetic drugs.",

Aims of treatment include minimising long-term complications (e.g. cardiovascular disease, blindness, chronic kidney disease, premature mortality) and avoiding unwanted effects of treatment (e.g. severe hypoglycaemia, weight gain). Management of diabetes includes patient support and education; addressing symptoms; lifestyle modification; targeting associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease; and surveillance for, and management of, complications including treatment-related hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin (Forxiga) belongs to a new class of oral glucose-lowering drugs that inhibit renal glucose reabsorption and promote glycosuria. It is licensed in the UK in adults with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and who are unable to tolerate metformin; or, as add-on therapy, with other glucose-lowering agents including insulin, when these, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. The company's advertising materials claim that dapagliflozin provides a \"novel method of controlling excess glucose\" with \"secondary benefit of weight loss\". Here, we review the evidence for the use of dapagliflozin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23170914": "Dapagliflozin (Forxiga\u00ae) is the first in a novel class of glucose-lowering agents known as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and is used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. By inhibiting the transporter protein SGLT2 in the kidneys, dapagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption, leading to urinary glucose excretion and a reduction in blood glucose levels. Unlike oral antidiabetic drugs from several other classes, the efficacy of dapagliflozin is independent of insulin secretion and action. Therefore, when used in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, dapagliflozin provides complementary therapy via its unique mechanism of action. A consistent finding across phase III, randomized, double-blind trials in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes was that dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg/day for 24 weeks as monotherapy in previously untreated patients, or as add-on combination therapy with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone or insulin-based therapy, significantly reduced both glycosylated haemoglobin values (primary endpoint) and fasting plasma glucose levels compared with placebo. Various randomized trials have also shown improvements in postprandial blood glucose with dapagliflozin monotherapy and combination therapy compared with placebo. In addition, dapagliflozin was noninferior to glipizide, in terms of glycaemic control after 52 weeks, when used as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes that was inadequately controlled with metformin. In most clinical trials, dapagliflozin was associated with reductions in body weight that were statistically superior to placebo or active comparators. Longer-term extension studies indicate that the efficacy of dapagliflozin is maintained for up to \u22482 years. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of 24 or 52 weeks duration and in extension studies of up to \u22482 years. Events suggestive of genital infections and urinary tract infections occurred more frequently among dapagliflozin than placebo recipients. These adverse events are of special interest because they appear to be related to the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin has a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia, especially when used alone or in combination with metformin, although the incidence of hypoglycaemic events reported with dapagliflozin in clinical trials varied depending on the background therapy. Longer-term tolerability/safety data with dapagliflozin are awaited with interest. In conclusion, dapagliflozin, with its unique and complementary mechanism of action, appears to be an important addition to the therapeutic options for the management of type 2 diabetes, particularly when used as add-on therapy.",

The possibility that T2D patients might be at increased risk in developing AD has serious societal implications. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is one of the best targets in the treatment of diabetes, whereas acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has long been regarded as a therapeutic target for AD. This study explores the molecular interactions between AChE and SGLT2 with a new US Food and Drug Administration approved antidiabetic drug Forxiga (dapagliflozin) to explore a possible link between the treatments of AD and diabetes. Docking study was performed using \"Autodock4.2.\" Hydrophobic and cation-\u03c0 interactions play an important role in the correct positioning of dapagliflozin within the catalytic site (CAS) of SGLT2 and AChE enzymes to permit docking. Free energy of binding (\u0394G) of \"dapagliflozin-SGLT2\" and \"dapagliflozin-CAS domain of AChE\" interactions was found to be -6.25 and -6.28 kcal/mol, respectively.

Access to molecular diagnostics, pre- and post-mortem, and documentation of pathophysiological responses while using the Milwaukee protocol, can add useful insights for the future of rabies management. A 58-year-old British Asian woman was referred to a regional general hospital in the UK with hydrophobia, anxiety and confusion nine weeks after receiving a dog bite in North West India. Nuchal skin biopsy, saliva, and a skin biopsy from the site of the dog bite wound, taken on the day of admission, all demonstrated the presence of rabies virus RNA. Within 48 hours sequence analysis of viral RNA confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated that the virus was a strain closely related to canine rabies viruses circulating in South Asia. Her condition deteriorated rapidly with increased agitation and autonomic dysfunction. She was heavily sedated and intubated on the day after admission, treated according to a modified Milwaukee protocol, and remained stable until she developed heart block and profound acidosis and died on the eighth day. Analysis of autopsy samples showed a complete absence of rabies neutralizing antibody in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and corresponding high levels of virus antigen and nucleic acid in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Quantitative PCR showed virus was also distributed widely in peripheral tissues despite mild or undetectable histopathological changes. Vagus nerve branches in the heart showed neuritis, a probable Negri body but no demonstrable rabies antigen. Rapid molecular diagnosis and strain typing is helpful in the management of human rabies infection. Post-mortem findings such as vagal neuritis highlight clinically important effects on the cardiovascular system which are typical for the clinical course of rabies in humans.

This decreases the dynamics of SGs, changes SG composition, and triggers an aberrant liquid-to-solid transition of <i>in vitro</i> reconstituted compartments. We show that chaperone recruitment prevents the formation of aberrant SGs and promotes SG disassembly when the stress subsides. Moreover, we identify a backup system for SG clearance, which involves transport of aberrant SGs to the aggresome and their degradation by autophagy.

A closed reference OTU picking resulted in the most divergent results in terms of both alpha and beta diversity, compared to open reference methods. Nevertheless, when OTUs were collapsed at the genus level, a high correlation was obtained among the estimated abundances of taxa for most studies. Aggregation of samples by their nature and occurrence of food spoilage or fermentation resulted in a very similar classification using two beta diversity analysis methods.

With the growing demand for analysis of the functional microbiome, metatranscriptome studies attract more interest. To make metatranscriptomic data sufficient for metataxonomics, new analytical workflows are needed to deal with sparse and taxonomically less informative sequencing data. We present a new protocol, IMSA+A, for accurate taxonomy classification based on metatranscriptome data of any read length that can efficiently and robustly identify bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the same sample. The new protocol improves accuracy by using a conservative reference database, employing a new counting scheme, and by assembling shotgun reads. Assembly also reduces analysis runtime. Simulated data were utilized to evaluate the protocol by permuting common experimental variables. When applied to the real metatranscriptome data for mouse intestines colonized by ASF, the protocol showed superior performance in detection of the microorganisms compared to the existing metataxonomics tools. IMSA+A is available at https://github.com/JeremyCoxBMI/IMSA-A . The developed protocol addresses the need for taxonomy classification from RNAseq data. Previously not utilized, i.e., unmapped to a reference genome, RNAseq reads can now be used to gather taxonomic information about the microbiota present in a biological sample without conducting additional sequencing. Any metatranscriptome pipeline that includes assembly of reads can add this analysis with minimal additional cost of compute time.

The aim of this study was to assess the integration of different approaches, genotypic (16S rRNA gene sequencing), proteomic (MALDI-TOF MS) and metabolomic (1H-NMR), for the taxonomic and metabolic characterization of Lactobacillus species. For this purpose we analyzed 40 strains of various origin (intestinal, vaginal, food, probiotics), belonging to different species. The high discriminatory power of MALDI-TOF for species identification was underlined by the excellent agreement with the genotypic analysis. Indeed, MALDI-TOF allowed to correctly identify 39 out of 40 Lactobacillus strains at the species level, with an overall concordance of 97.5%. In the perspective to simplify the MALDI TOF sample preparation, especially for routine practice, we demonstrated the perfect agreement of the colony-picking from agar plates with the protein extraction protocol. 1H-NMR analysis, applied to both culture supernatants and bacterial lysates, identified a panel of metabolites whose variations in concentration were associated with the taxonomy, but also revealed a high intra-species variability that did not allow a species-level identification.

These potentially beneficial effects have been shown in healthy subjects as well as in patients with risk factors (arterial hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) or established CVD (coronary heart disease or heart failure). Several potential mechanisms are supposed to be responsible for the positive effect of cocoa; among them activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, increased bioavailability of NO as well as antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is the aim of this review to summarize the findings of cocoa and chocolate on BP and vascular function.",

Between the different plant foods, chocolate has been shown to decrease CVD risk due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, as we recently showed in epidemiological studies, meta-analyses, and human trials, dietary antioxidants resulted more effective in subjects characterized by an ongoing oxidative stress, than in healthy people. Aim of this work was to investigate the effect of different concentrations of chocolate phenolic extract (CPE) on <i>in vitro</i> free radical production, stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), in leukocytes extracted from blood of normo-weight and overweight/obese subjects. Neutrophils from overweight/obese group had a significantly higher free radical production compared to the normo-weight group. In neutrophils, the lowest CPE concentration significantly reduced free radical production in overweight/obese group only, and higher CPE concentrations were effective in both groups. In monocytes, the CPE concentration that was significantly effective in reducing free radical production was lower in overweight/obese subjects than in normo-weight subjects. Chocolate polyphenol extracts inhibit oxidative burst in human neutrophils and monocytes with a higher efficiency in subjects characterized by an unphysiological oxidative/inflammatory stress, such as overweight and obese. Results of this study provide further evidence about a differential role of dietary antioxidant strictly related to the \"stress\" condition of the subjects.",

Polyphenols are present in a variety of foods including grapes, berries, dark chocolate, coffee and tea to mention a few. A number of studies have shown that dietary polyphenols exert a protective effect against hypertension, dyslipidemias, inflammation, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, conditions associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Studies indicate that by decreasing cholesterol absorption, polyphenols alter hepatic cholesterol homeostasis resulting in decreases in plasma lipids and reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins thus having a protective effect against atherosclerosis; polyphenols have also been shown to decrease the activity of enzymes involved in the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system and improve blood pressure. Further, they have been recognized to increase nitric oxide production and to improve endothelial function. In this review we will present some of the evidence derived from epidemiological studies, clinical interventions as well as animal and cell studies supporting the cardioprotective effects of dietary polyphenols.",

We aimed to examine the prospective associations between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke among men and women in a large population-based cohort. A total of 38,182 men and 46,415 women aged 44-76 years, and free of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer at baseline in 1995 and 1998, were followed up until the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively. We obtained data on chocolate consumption for each participant using a self-administrated food frequency questionnaire that included 138 food and beverage items. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke in relation to chocolate consumption. During a median follow-up of 12.9 years, we identified 3558 incident strokes cases (2146 cerebral infarctions and 1396 hemorrhagic strokes). After adjustment for age, body mass index, life styles, dietary intakes, and other risk factors, chocolate consumption was associated with a significant lower risk of stroke in women (HR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99). However, the association in men was not significant (HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.80-1.10). In addition, the association did not vary by stroke subtypes in either men or women. Findings from this large Japanese cohort supported a significant inverse association between chocolate consumption and risk of developing stroke in women. However, residual confounding could not be excluded as an alternative explanation for our findings.",

The present study reviews some relevant studies about chocolate (and its bioactive compounds) on some cardiovascular risk factors and stresses the need of future studies. The consumption of cocoa/ chocolate (i) increases plasma antioxidant capacity, (ii) diminishes platelet function and inflammation, and (iii) decreases diastolic and systolic arterial pressures. Data currently available indicate that daily consumption of cocoa-rich chocolate (rich in polyphenols) may at least partially lower cardiovascular disease risk.

Treatment effects associated with dark chocolate consumption derived from published meta-analyses were used to determine the absolute number of cardiovascular events with and without treatment. Costs associated with cardiovascular events and treatments were applied to determine the potential amount of funding required for dark chocolate therapy to be considered cost effective. Daily consumption of dark chocolate (polyphenol content equivalent to 100 g of dark chocolate) can reduce cardiovascular events by 85 (95% confidence interval 60 to 105) per 10,000 population treated over 10 years. $A40 (\u00a325; \u20ac31; $42) could be cost effectively spent per person per year on prevention strategies using dark chocolate.

Less is known about the effects of chocolate on arterial stiffness, a marker of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether chocolate intakes are independently associated with pulse wave velocity (PWV), after adjustment for cardiovascular, lifestyle and dietary factors. Prospective analyses were undertaken on 508 community-dwelling participants (mean age 61 years, 60% women) from the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study (MSLS). Habitual chocolate intakes, measured using a food frequency questionnaire, were related to PWV, measured approximately 5 years later. Chocolate intake was significantly associated with PWV in a non-linear fashion with the highest levels of PWV in those who never or rarely ate chocolate and lowest levels in those who consumed chocolate once a week. This pattern of results remained and was not attenuated after multivariate adjustment for diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors and dietary variables (p = 0.002). Weekly chocolate intake may be of benefit to arterial stiffness. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms that may mediate the observed effects of habitual chocolate consumption on arterial stiffness.",

The Swedish prospective study included 67 640 women and men from the Cohort of Swedish Men and the Swedish Mammography Cohort who had completed a food-frequency questionnaire and were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Myocardial infarction (MI) cases were ascertained through linkage with the Swedish National Patient and Cause of Death Registers. PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched from inception until 4 February 2016 to identify prospective studies on chocolate consumption and risk of ischaemic heart disease. The results from eligible studies were combined using a random-effects model. During follow-up (1998-2010), 4417 MI cases were ascertained in the Swedish study. Chocolate consumption was inversely associated with MI risk. Compared with non-consumers, the multivariable relative risk for those who consumed \u22653-4 servings/week of chocolate was 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; p for trend =0.04).

Cocoa and particularly dark chocolate are rich in flavonoids and recent studies have demonstrated blood pressure lowering effects of dark chocolate. However, limited data are available on the association of chocolate consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We sought to examine the association between chocolate consumption and prevalent CHD. We studied in a cross-sectional design 4970 participants aged 25-93 years who participated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Family Heart Study. Chocolate intake was assessed through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate adjusted odds ratios. Compared to subjects who did not report any chocolate intake, odds ratios (95% CI) for CHD were 1.01 (0.76-1.37), 0.74 (0.56-0.98), and 0.43 (0.28-0.67) for subjects consuming 1-3 times/month, 1-4 times/week, and 5+ times/week, respectively (p for trend &lt;0.0001) adjusting for age, sex, family CHD risk group, energy intake, education, non-chocolate candy intake, linolenic acid intake, smoking, alcohol intake, exercise, and fruit and vegetables. Consumption of non-chocolate candy was associated with a 49% higher prevalence of CHD comparing 5+/week vs. 0/week [OR = 1.49 (0.96-2.32)].

A random sample of 1153 individuals, aged 18-69 years, was recruited to participate in the cross-sectional Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg study. Chocolate consumption (g/d) was obtained from a semi-quantitative FFQ. Blood glucose and insulin levels were used for the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Hepatic biomarkers such as serum \u03b3-glutamyl-transpeptidase (\u03b3-GT), serum aspartate transaminase and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (mg/l) were assessed using standard laboratory assays. Chocolate consumers (81\u00b78 %) were more likely to be younger, physically active, affluent people with higher education levels and fewer chronic co-morbidities. After excluding subjects taking antidiabetic medications, higher chocolate consumption was associated with lower HOMA-IR (\u03b2=-0\u00b716, P=0\u00b7004), serum insulin levels (\u03b2=-0\u00b716, P=0\u00b7003) and \u03b3-GT (\u03b2=-0\u00b712, P=0\u00b7009) and ALT (\u03b2=-0\u00b709, P=0\u00b7004), after adjustment for age, sex, education, lifestyle and dietary confounding factors, including intakes of fruits and vegetables, alcohol, polyphenol-rich coffee and tea. This study reports an independent inverse relationship between daily chocolate consumption and levels of insulin, HOMA-IR and liver enzymes in adults, suggesting that chocolate consumption may improve liver enzymes and protect against insulin resistance, a well-established risk factor for cardiometabolic disorders. Further observational prospective research and well-designed randomised-controlled studies are needed to confirm this cross-sectional relationship and to comprehend the role and mechanisms that different types of chocolate may play in insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disorders.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11790962": "Epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse association of tea consumption with cardiovascular disease. The antioxidant effects of flavonoids in tea (including preventing oxidative damage to LDL) are among the potential mechanisms that could underlie the protective effects. Other possible mechanisms include attenuating the inflammatory process in atherosclerosis, reducing thrombosis, promoting normal endothelial function, and blocking expression of cellular adhesion molecules. Cocoa and chocolate can also be rich sources of flavonoids. Flavanols and procyanidins isolated from cocoa exhibit strong antioxidant properties in-vitro. In acute feeding studies, flavanol-rich cocoa and chocolate increased plasma antioxidant capacity and reduced platelet reactivity. Based on limited data, approximately 150 mg of flavonoids is needed to trigger a rapid antioxidant effect and changes in prostacyclin. Some dose-response evidence demonstrates an antioxidant effect with approximately 500 mg flavonoids. Brewed tea typically contains approximately 172 mg total flavonoids per 235 ml (brewed for 2 min); hence, consumption of 1 and 3.5 cups of tea would be expected to elicit acute and chronic physiologic effects, respectively. Chocolate is more variable with some products containing essentially no flavonoids (0.09 mg procyanidin/g), whereas others are high in flavonoids (4 mg procyanidin/g). Thus, approximate estimates of flavonoid rich chocolate needed to exert acute and chronic effects are 38 and 125 g, respectively. Collectively, the antioxidant effects of flavonoid-rich foods may reduce cardiovascular disease risk.",

Less is known about the effects of cocoa/chocolate on the augmentation index (AI), a measure of vascular stiffness and vascular tone in the peripheral arterioles. We enrolled thirty middle-aged, overweight adults in a randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-week, cross-over study. During the active treatment (cocoa) period, the participants consumed 37 g/d of dark chocolate and a sugar-free cocoa beverage (total cocoa = 22 g/d, total flavanols (TF) = 814 mg/d). Colour-matched controls included a low-flavanol chocolate bar and a cocoa-free beverage with no added sugar (TF = 3 mg/d). Treatments were matched for total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates and protein. The cocoa treatment significantly increased the basal diameter and peak diameter of the brachial artery by 6% (+2 mm) and basal blood flow volume by 22%. Substantial decreases in the AI, a measure of arterial stiffness, were observed in only women. Flow-mediated dilation and the reactive hyperaemia index remained unchanged. The consumption of cocoa had no effect on fasting blood measures, while the control treatment increased fasting insulin concentration and insulin resistance (P= 0\u00b701). Fasting blood pressure (BP) remained unchanged, although the acute consumption of cocoa increased resting BP by 4 mmHg. In summary, the high-flavanol cocoa and dark chocolate treatment was associated with enhanced vasodilation in both conduit and resistance arteries and was accompanied by significant reductions in arterial stiffness in women.",

In the blood, a decrease in platelet aggregation and an increase in angiogenetic progenitor cells was noted. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effects, an amelioration of the lipid profile and glucose metabolism was described. An increase of endothelial NO production following the ingestion of the antioxidant cocoa flavanols catechin and epicatechin seems to be the leading mechanism causing these effects. In animal studies of myocardial reperfusion, a decrease in infarct size was noted. In several prospective cohort studies from Europe and the United States, a 50 % reduction of mortality mostly due to a reduction of myocardial infarction was published. Consumption up to about 25 g daily of a flavanol rich dark chocolate (ca. 85 % cocoa content) can be recommended for cardiovascular prevention. In this moderate dosage, the potentially harmful effects due to weight gain and cadmium intake will be minimal. However, controlled randomized trials with well defined clinical endpoints are needed to prove the positive effects described so far. At this point, in time based on the information described in this article, a moderate consumption of flavanol rich cocoa products seems to be effective in the prevention of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.",

Thirty-two healthy participants underwent two baseline sessions after one night of undisturbed sleep and two experimental sessions after one night of total sleep deprivation. Two hours before each testing session, participants were randomly assigned to consume high or poor flavanol chocolate bars. During the tests were evaluated, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and a working memory task, office SBP and DBP, flow-mediated dilation and pulse-wave velocity. Sleep deprivation increased SBP/DBP. SBP/DBP and pulse pressure were lower after flavanol-rich treatment respect to flavanol-poor treatment (SBP: 116.9 \u00b1 1.6 vs. 120.8 \u00b1 1.9 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.00005; DBP: 70.5 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 72.3 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.01; pulse pressure: 46.4 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 48.4 \u00b1 1.5 mmHg, P = 0.004).

Among 1155 differentially expressed circRNAs, 715 were upregulated and 440 were downregulated in breast cancer tissues. The validation study demonstrated that hsa_circ_103110, hsa_circ_104689 and hsa_circ_104821 levels were elevated in breast cancer tissues, whereas hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were downregulated.

Circ-Seq also provides informative genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates. We applied Circ-Seq first to RNA-sequence data from breast cancer cell lines and validated one of the large circRNAs identified. Circ-Seq was then applied to a larger cohort of breast cancer samples (n = 885) provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including tumors and normal-adjacent tissue samples. Notably, circRNA results reveal that normal-adjacent tissues in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) subtype have relatively higher numbers of circRNAs than tumor samples in TCGA. Similar phenomenon of high circRNA numbers were observed in normal breast-mammary tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Finally, we observed that number of circRNAs in normal-adjacent samples of ER+ subtype is inversely correlated to the risk-of-relapse proliferation (ROR-P) score for proliferating genes, suggesting that circRNA frequency may be a marker for cell proliferation in breast cancer. The Circ-Seq workflow will function for both single and multi-threaded compute environments.

In developed countries, most cases of WE have been seen in alcohol misusers. Other reported causes are gastrointestinal tract surgery, hyperemesis gravidarum, chronic malnutrition, prolonged total parenteral nutrition without thiamine supplementation, and increased nutrient requirements as in trauma or septic shock. WE is a well-known postoperative complication of gastric restrictive surgery for morbid obesity, after which patients often experience protracted nausea and vomiting, leading to malnutrition and massive weight loss. This case report concerns WE occurring in a patient who underwent Roux-en-Y subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and subsequently experienced neurological symptoms that proved irreversible probably due to the lengthy time elapsing between their clinical presentation and the diagnosis of WE. There have been some reports of WE occurring after total or subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer in non-obese patients with no history of alcoholism, but monitoring for WE has yet to be recommended in the clinical guidelines in this setting (as it has for bariatric surgery). Because of its rarity and variable clinical presentation, WE is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, and confused with other neurological problems. There is an urgent need for the specific guidelines to take into account not only the neoplastic follow-up of such patients, but also the possible side effects of necessary surgery, since this could help to ensure the timely diagnosis and management of WE in this setting, and to avoid, when possible, claims for medical malpractice that may cause enormous costs both in economical and professional terms.",

We investigated the frequency and associated features of cancer-related Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in the published literature. We included 90 articles reporting on 129 patients. Only 38 (30%) of 128 patients with data available exhibited the entire triad of classic features of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia or nystagmus. Diagnosis during life was missed altogether in 22 (17%) of 128 patients.

Complete recovery was reported in only 47 (36%) cases. Given that oncologists or haematologists accounted for only 17 (19%) first authors among the articles included, it is important that oncologists are aware of the risk factors for cancer-related Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and that they are vigilant about diagnosing and treating the disease especially in the absence of alcohol misuse disorders.",

The first patient was a woman diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. After a gastrointestinal infection, she developed depression, memory loss, disorientation, behavioral changes, and ataxic paraplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral alterations in thalamic, frontal, and periaqueductal regions, suggestive of WE. The second patient was a man who lost 10 kg after surgical gastrectomy; he developed diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, lower limb paresthesias, and amnesia. A brain MRI demonstrated contrast enhancement of mammillary bodies, compatible with WE. The patients were treated with intramuscular (IM) thiamine (1200 mg/d for 2 months and 900 mg/d for a month, respectively) with gradual cognitive and behavioral improvement and brain MRI normalization, while ataxia and oculomotion improved in following months. In both patients, thiamine was gradually reduced to IM 200 mg/d and continued for a year, without clinical relapses. There is no consensus about dosage, frequency, route, and duration of thiamine administration in WE treatment. Based on our cases, we recommend treating patients with WE with higher doses of IM thiamine for a longer time than suggested (900-1200 mg/d for 1-2 months, in our cases) and to gradually reduce dosage after clinical and radiological improvement, maintaining IM 200 mg/d dosage for at least 1 year.",

Wernicke's encephalopathy results from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Common causes include alcoholism and gastric disorders. Wernicke's has been described in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); however, given these patients' immunosuppressed state, the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy is not apparent. Case Presentation. A 31-year-old previously healthy male presented to the ER complaining of progressive dyspnea. Workup revealed HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia. He was treated and improved. On day 14 he became confused and developed nystagmus and ataxia. Considering his immunocompromised state, infectious and neoplastic etiologies topped the differential diagnosis. CT head was negative. Lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Brain MRI revealed increased T2 signal in the medial thalamus bilaterally. Intravenous thiamine was administered resulting in resolution of symptoms. Discussion. The classic triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy occurs in 10% of cases. When immunosuppressed patients develop acute neurologic symptoms infectious or neoplastic etiologies must be excluded. However, given the relative safety of thiamine supplementation, there should be a low threshold for initiating therapy in order to reverse the symptoms and prevent progression to Korsakoff dementia, which is permanent.",

A multicenter study group retrospectively reviewed MR brain imaging findings, clinical histories, and presentations of 26 patients (14 female, 12 male) diagnosed between 1999 and 2006 with Wernicke encephalopathy. The age range was 6-81 years (mean age, 46 .6+/-19 years). Fifty percent of the patients had a history of alcohol abuse, and 50% had no history of alcohol abuse. Eighty percent showed changes in consciousness, 77% had ocular symptoms, and 54% had ataxia. Only 38% of the patients showed the classic triad of the disease at clinical presentation. At MR examination, 85% of the patients showed symmetric lesions in the medial thalami and the periventricular region of the third ventricle, 65% in the periaqueductal area, 58% in the mamillary bodies, 38% in the tectal plate, and 8% in the dorsal medulla. Contrast enhancement of the mamillary bodies was statistically positively correlated with the alcohol abuse group.

Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets.

Using a longitudinal sample of nondemented adults (n = 642, aged 53-95) we focused on memory resilience (over 9 years) to 2 AD risk variants (APOE, CLU). Growth mixture models classified resilience. Random forest analysis, stratified by sex, tested the predictive importance of 22 nongenetic risk factors from 5 domains (n = 24-112). For both sexes, younger age, higher education, stronger grip, and everyday novel cognitive activity predicted memory resilience. For women, 9 factors from functional, health, mobility, and lifestyle domains were also predictive. For men, only fewer depressive symptoms was an additional important predictor.

However, some 30 to 50% of older individuals who harbor AD pathology do not become symptomatic in their lifetime. It is hypothesized that such individuals exhibit cognitive resilience that protects against AD dementia. We hypothesized that in cases with AD pathology, structural changes in dendritic spines would distinguish individuals who had or did not have clinical dementia. We compared dendritic spines within layer II and III pyramidal neuron dendrites in Brodmann area 46 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the Golgi-Cox technique in 12 age-matched pathology-free controls, 8 controls with AD pathology (CAD), and 21 AD cases. We used highly optimized methods to trace impregnated dendrites from bright-field microscopy images that enabled accurate 3-dimensional digital reconstruction of dendritic structure for morphologic analyses. Spine density was similar among control and CAD cases but was reduced significantly in AD. Thin and mushroom spines were reduced significantly in AD compared to CAD brains, whereas stubby spine density was decreased significantly in CAD and AD compared to controls. Increased spine extent distinguished CAD cases from controls and AD. Linear regression analysis of all cases indicated that spine density was not associated with neuritic plaque score but did display negative correlation with Braak staging. These observations provide cellular evidence to support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity is a mechanism of cognitive resilience that protects older individuals with AD pathology from developing dementia.

Participants with normal cognition (n = 297) and mild cognitive impairment (n = 432) were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Resilience metrics were defined at baseline by examining the residuals when regressing brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume and cognition) on CSF biomarkers. A positive residual reflected better outcomes than expected for a given level of pathology (high resilience). Residuals were integrated into a latent variable model of resilience and validated by testing their ability to independently predict diagnostic conversion, cognitive decline, and the rate of ventricular dilation. Latent variables of resilience predicted a decreased risk of conversion (hazard ratio &lt; 0.54, p &lt; 0.0001), slower cognitive decline (\u03b2 &gt; 0.02, p &lt; 0.001), and slower rates of ventricular dilation (\u03b2 &lt; -4.7, p &lt; 2 \u00d7 10<sup>-15</sup>).

Genome wide genotyping and sequencing studies have identified many genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). While most of these variants are associated with increased risk of developing LOAD, only limited number of reports focused on variants that are protective against the disease. Here we applied a novel approach to uncover protective alleles against AD by analyzing genetic and phenotypic data in Mount Sinai Biobank and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) databases. We discovered a likely loss-of-function small deletion variant in the caspase 7 (CASP7) gene associated with significantly reduced incidence of LOAD in carriers of the high-risk APOE \u03b54 allele. Further investigation of four independent cohorts of European ancestry revealed the protective effect of the CASP7 variant against AD is most significant in homozygous APOE \u03b54 allele carriers. Meta analysis of multiple datasets shows overall odds ratio = 0.45 (p = 0.004). Analysis of RNA sequencing derived gene expression data indicated the variant correlates with reduced caspase 7 expression in multiple brain tissues we examined. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that caspase 7 plays a key role in microglial activation driving neuro-degeneration during AD pathogenesis, and may explain the underlying genetic mechanisms that anti-inflammatory interventions in AD show greater benefit in APOE \u03b54 carriers than non-carriers. Our findings inform potential novel therapeutic opportunities for AD and warrant further investigations.",

CDKN2A sequencing verified 13 mutation carriers and 16 non-carriers. Nine participants were spouse controls without a history of melanoma and did not carry a CDKN2A mutation. Mutation carriers demonstrated a greater mean TNN and TND at initial and follow-up examinations compared with non-carriers and continued to develop nevi rather than show nevus regression seen in non-carriers and spouse controls. Non-carriers showed an intermediate nevus phenotype between mutation carriers and spouse controls. Four of the 13 mutation carriers and one non-carrier have developed invasive melanoma. Over a 15-y interval, TNN and TND were increased in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers and spouse controls. Continued accumulation of nevi in mutation carriers supports a nevogenic role for this CDKN2A mutation.

Rare germline mutations in CDKN2A predispose to melanoma and appear to be nevogenic, although the correlation between nevus phenotype and mutation status is poor. It is plausible that more common CDKN2A variants may influence both melanoma susceptibility and nevus susceptibility. Ala148Thr is a G to A missense polymorphism of CDKN2A, which is found in 4%-6% of the general population. We have investigated the role of Ala148Thr as a low penetrance melanoma or nevus susceptibility allele in two separate groups of individuals. The first was a sample of 488 adults recruited from 179 families of patients with the atypical nevus phenotype and/or a family history of melanoma, and the second was a population-based sample of 599 women. Similar prevalences of Ala148Thr (4.9% and 5.2%) were found in both samples but significant variation in the prevalence of the polymorphism was seen across geographic areas within England. There was no association between Ala148Thr status and nevus number or history of melanoma, and therefore the results did not support the hypothesis that the Ala148Thr variant is a low penetrance melanoma or nevus susceptibility allele. A significant protective role of Ala148Thr on the number of atypical nevi was observed in the family sample (mean of 1 atypical nevus in those with the allele and 3.5 nevi in those without, p = 0.02).

Individual characteristics which best predicted mutant gene carrier status were: nevi on the buttocks (odds ratio 4.4; confidence interval 1. 6-12.4), nevi on the feet (odds ratio 4.2; confidence interval 1. 4-12.5), total nevus number being at least 100 (nevi &gt; or = 2 mm in diameter) (odds ratio 3.4; confidence interval 1.0-11.1) and two or more clinically atypical nevi (odds ratio 3.1; confidence interval 1. 1-9.0). Gene carriers were also significantly more likely to have noticeable freckling and possibly also Fitzpatrick skin types 1-3. The overlap between gene carriers and nongene carriers was, however, marked: the atypical mole syndrome did not clearly differentiate mutant gene carriers from those with a normal gene. This study is of significance to clinicians as the clinical practice of using the atypical mole syndrome to identify particular family members for surveillance is shown to be inappropriate.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a fatal degenerative disease and, although it had largely disappeared because of nearly universal measles vaccination, it still remains a serious infection among children affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The lack of newer cases of SSPE occurring among normal children nowadays should not wane alertness by obstetricians and paediatricians, to recognize the risk with measles during pregnancy and the need for prevention and recognition of SSPE at an early stage.

Most of the SSPE cases reported measles at an age significantly younger than that of the general population. This pattern did not change after introduction of antimeasles vaccination. Incidence was significantly lower (p less than 10(-9) in the vaccinated population than in the unvaccinated population.

Why MeV vaccine strains never cause SSPE is completely unknown. Hypothesizing that this phenotypic difference could potentially be represented by a molecular marker, we compared glycoprotein and matrix (M) genes from SSPE cases with those from the Moraten vaccine strain, searching for differential structural motifs. We observed that all known SSPE viruses have residues P64, E89, and A209 (PEA) in their M proteins whereas the equivalent residues for vaccine strains are either S64, K89, and T209 (SKT) as in Moraten or PKT. Through the construction of MeV recombinants, we have obtained evidence that the wt MeV-M protein PEA motif, in particular A209, is linked to increased viral spread. Importantly, for the 10 wt genotypes (of 23) that have had their M proteins sequenced, 9 have the PEA motif, the exception being B3, which has PET. Interestingly, cases of SSPE caused by genotype B3 have yet to be reported. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that the PEA motif is a molecular marker for wt MeV at risk to cause SSPE.",

Measles antibody is found in the spinal fluid, and its presence is particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis. The mechanisms of pathogenesis of SSPE apparently involves the selection of clones of virus, which do not replicate to become complete virus particles. These \"suppressed\" viruses are able to multiply and spread from cell to cell. The immune system of the patient is unable to clear this infection. Several hypotheses are advanced to explain these events. Further studies are needed, however, to develop a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases.

There was an average annual decline of 14% in SSPE onset over the period, consistent with the decline in notified measles over the last 20 years. A history of measles was present in 35 (median age 1.3 years), the most recent recorded date being 1994; the interval from measles to onset of SSPE ranged from 2.7 to 23.4 years.

Brain biopsy specimens from a further three cases with a history of measles, of whom two had also had a history of vaccination, showed wild-type strain. The prevention of endemic circulation of measles virus in England and Wales through the high coverage achieved with MMR vaccine, together with the measles/rubella vaccination campaign of 1994, has resulted in the near elimination of SSPE. However, the recent decline in MMR vaccine coverage, with the associated increase in localised measles outbreaks and cases in young infants, is of concern.

To detect the measles virus genome in a patient with SSPE and to analyze its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence. We applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the measles virus genome in specimens from a 12-year-old boy with SSPE who had received measles vaccine 10 years before and had no history of apparent natural measles. The oligonucleotide primers for PCR were prepared based on the nucleotide sequence of the F and NP genes of the measles virus Edmonston strain. F and NP genes were detected in both the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analysis of the F gene showed that the patient's virus was different from that of the vaccine strain. Judging from these results, it was likely that the SSPE-associated strain in this case was derived from the wild-type rather than the vaccine strain. PCR is a useful method to establish a definitive diagnosis of SSPE and to study the nature of the SSPE-associated virus.",

Therefore, SSPE registries and routine measles immunization were established in many countries concurrently. We conducted a comprehensive review of the impact of measles immunization on the epidemiology of SSPE and examined epidemiological evidence on whether there was any vaccine-associated risk. Published epidemiological data on SSPE, national SSPE incidence, measles incidence and vaccine coverage, reports of SSPE in pregnancy or shortly post partum were reviewed. Potential adverse relationships between measles vaccines and SSPE were examined using available data. Epidemiological data showed that successful measles immunization programmes protect against SSPE and, consistent with virological data, that measles vaccine virus does not cause SSPE. Measles vaccine does not: accelerate the course of SSPE; trigger SSPE or cause SSPE in those with an established benign persistent wild measles infection. Evidence points to wild virus causing SSPE in cases which have been immunized and have had no known natural measles infection. Perinatal measles infection may result in SSPE with a short onset latency and fulminant course. Such cases are very rare. SSPE during pregnancy appears to be fulminant. Infants born to mothers with SSPE have not been subsequently diagnosed with SSPE themselves. Successful measles vaccination programmes directly and indirectly protect the population against SSPE and have the potential to eliminate SSPE through the elimination of measles.

This review summarizes reports to date on brainstem involvement in SSPE, including the clinical course of disease, neuroimaging presentations, and guidelines for treatment. A comprehensive literature search was performed for English-language publications with keywords \"subacute sclerosing panencephalitis\" and \"brainstem\" using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database (March 1981-September 2017). Eleven articles focusing on SSPE of the brainstem were included. Predominant brainstem involvement remains uncharacteristic of SSPE, which may lead to misdiagnosis and poor outcome. A number of case reports have demonstrated brainstem involvement associated with other intracranial lesions commonly presenting in later SSPE stages (III and IV). However, brainstem lesions can appear in all stages, independent of higher cortical structures. The varied clinical presentations complicate diagnosis from a neuroimaging perspective. SSPE of the brainstem is a rare but important clinical entity. It may present like canonical SSPE or with unique clinical features such as absence seizures and pronounced ataxia.

In addition to yield and quality losses, FHB contaminates cereal grain with mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol, which are harmful to human, animal and ecosystem health. Currently, FHB control is only partially effective due to several intractable problems. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism that regulates gene expression. RNAi has been exploited in the development of new genomic tools that allow the targeted silencing of genes of interest in many eukaryotes. Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) is a transgenic technology used to silence fungal genes in planta during attempted infection and thereby reduces disease levels. HIGS relies on the host plant's ability to produce mobile small interfering RNA molecules, generated from long double-stranded RNA, which are complementary to targeted fungal genes. These molecules are transferred from the plant to invading fungi via an uncharacterised mechanism, to cause gene silencing. Here, we describe recent advances in RNAi-mediated control of plant pathogenic fungi, highlighting the key advantages and disadvantages.

The aim is to use these techniques to prevent the maternal transmission of serious mitochondrial diseases. Major claims have been made about the quality of the debates that preceded this legislation and the significance of those debates for UK decision-making on other biotechnologies, as well as for other countries considering similar legislation. In this article we conduct a systematic analysis of those UK debates and suggest that claims about their quality are over-stated. We identify, and analyse in detail, ten areas where greater clarity, depth and nuance would have produced sharper understandings of the contributions, limitations and wider social impacts of these mitochondrial interventions. We explore the implications of these additional considerations for (i) the protection of all parties involved, should the techniques transfer to clinical applications; (ii) the legitimacy of focussing on short-term gains for individuals over public health considerations, and (iii) the maintenance and improvement of public trust in medical biotechnologies. We conclude that a more measured evaluation of the content and quality of the UK debates is important and timely: such a critique provides a clearer understanding of the possible, but specific, contributions of these interventions, both in the UK and elsewhere; also, these additional insights can now inform the emerging processes of implementation, regulation and practice of mitochondrial interventions.",

Dovitinib, a potent FGFR inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with FGFR pathway-amplified breast cancer. In this randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we evaluated whether the addition of dovitinib to fulvestrant would improve outcomes in postmenopausal patients with HR<sup>+</sup>, HER2<sup>-</sup> advanced breast cancer that had progressed during or after prior ET. Patients were stratified by FGF pathway amplification and presence of visceral disease, and they were randomized 1:1 to receive fulvestrant plus dovitinib or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). From 15 May 2012 to 26 November 2014, 97 patients from 36 centers were enrolled. The frequency of FGF pathway amplification was lower than anticipated, and the study was terminated early owing to slow accrual of patients with FGF pathway amplification. The median PFS (95% CI) was 5.5 (3.8-14.0) months vs 5.5 (3.5-10.7) months in the dovitinib vs placebo arms, respectively (HR, 0.68; did not meet predefined efficacy criteria). For the FGF pathway-amplified subgroup (n = 31), the median PFS (95% CI) was 10.9 (3.5-16.5) months vs 5.5 (3.5-16.4) months in the dovitinib vs placebo arms, respectively (HR, 0.64; met the predefined superiority criteria). Frequently reported adverse events in the dovitinib (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, and headache) and placebo (diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and asthenia) arms were mostly low grade. The safety profile of dovitinib plus fulvestrant was consistent with the known safety profile of single-agent dovitinib. Dovitinib in combination with fulvestrant showed promising clinical activity in the FGF pathway-amplified subgroup. However, the data reported herein should be interpreted with caution, given that fewer PFS events occurred in the FGF pathway-amplified patients than was expected and that an effect of dovitinib regardless of FGR pathway amplification status cannot be excluded, because the population was smaller than expected.

The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathways may be a relevant target in MPM. Dovitinib inhibits multiple tyrosine receptor kinases, predominantly the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), but also FGFRs, and could be active in MPM. This open-label multicentre phase II trial [<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01769547\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01769547</a>] enrolled fit, consenting adult patients with advanced MPM who had previously received platinum-antifolate combination chemotherapy and up to one additional line of systemic therapy. Dovitinib was administered orally at 500mg/day for 5days on, 2days off, in 28-day cycles. Response was assessed every 2 cycles using RECIST 1.1 criteria modified for MPM. Correlative studies included FGFR-1 amplification on archival tumour and serum samples for circulating angiogenesis factors. The primary end-point was the proportion of patients progression-free at 3 months (PF3) using a two-stage design. 12 patients (10 males, median age 67) were enrolled. The median number of cycles administered was 2.5 (range 1-8). One unconfirmed partial response was observed. PF3 was 50% (95% confidence interval 28.4% to 88.0%); although the criterion for proceeding to stage II accrual was met, the trial was halted due to a combination of minimal activity with several early progression events and poor tolerability in this patient population. One of 12 tumour specimens had low amplification of FGFR-1. Dovitinib has minimal activity in previously-treated MPM. The role of the FGFR pathway in MPM remains unclear.",

Aggressive and metastatic tumors are treated with androgen deprivation therapies (ADT); however, the tumors acquire resistance and develop into lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). With the advent of better therapeutics, the incidences of a more aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) variant continue to emerge. Although de novo occurrences of NEPC are rare, more than 25% of the therapy-resistant patients on highly potent new-generation anti-androgen therapies end up with NEPC. This, along with previous observations of an increase in the number of such NE cells in aggressive tumors, has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance development during prostate cancer progression. Dovitinib (TKI-258/CHIR-258) is a pan receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that targets VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and KIT. It has shown efficacy in mouse-model of PCa bone metastasis, and is presently in clinical trials for several cancers. We observed that both androgen receptor (AR) positive and AR-negative PCa cells differentiate into a NE phenotype upon treatment with Dovitinib. The NE differentiation was also observed when mice harboring PC3-xenografted tumors were systemically treated with Dovitinib. The mechanistic underpinnings of this differentiation are unclear, but seem to be supported through MAPK-, PI3K-, and Wnt-signaling pathways. Further elucidation of the differentiation process will enable the identification of alternative salvage or combination therapies to overcome the potential resistance development.",

Dovitinib, a suppressor of FGFR activity, may be active in ACC.<b>Experimental Design:</b> In a two-stage phase II study, 35 patients with progressive ACC were treated with dovitinib 500 mg orally for 5 of 7 days continuously. The primary endpoints were objective response rate and change in tumor growth rate. Progression-free survival, overall survival, metabolic response, biomarker, and quality of life were secondary endpoints.<b>Results:</b> Of 34 evaluable patients, 2 (6%) had a partial response and 22 (65%) had stable disease &gt;4 months. Median PFS was 8.2 months and OS was 20.6 months. The slope of the overall TGR fell from 1.95 to 0.63 on treatment (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Toxicity was moderate; 63% of patients developed grade 3-4 toxicity, 94% required dose modifications, and 21% stopped treatment early. An early metabolic response based on <sup>18</sup>FDG-PET scans was seen in 3 of 15 patients but did not correlate with RECIST response. <i>MYB</i> gene translocation was observed and significantly correlated with overexpression of MYB but did not correlate with FGFR1 phosphorylation or clinical response to dovitinib.<b>Conclusions:</b> Dovitinib produced few objective responses in patients with ACC but did suppress the TGR with a PFS that compares favorably with those reported with other targeted agents. Future studies of more potent and selective FGFR inhibitors in biomarker-selected patients will be required to determine whether FGFR signaling is a valid therapeutic target in ACC. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4138-45. \u00a92017 AACR</i>.",

Therapeutic strategies inhibiting these signaling pathways might lead to innovative HNSCC treatments. Five HNSCC cell lines were characterized based on VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression by sqRT-PCR and treated with three different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (nintedanib, dovitinib and pazopanib), all of which are effective against VEGFR and FGFR family members. Crystal violet assays were performed to analyze the effect of the treatments on cell growth (viability). Additionally, VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and statistical analyses were performed to investigate the receptor expression level in the different cell lines and the efficacy of the single-agent treatments. A correlation analysis was performed to quantify the degree of relationship between receptor expression and drug efficacy. With the exception of VEGFR2, the targeted receptors were expressed at different levels in all of the cell lines. The cell lines exhibited concentration-dependent responses with cell line-specific differences toward two of the three TKIs (nintedanib and dovitinib). Notably, all of the cell lines were resistant to pazopanib. TKIs have potential as therapeutic agents for HNSCC. Cell line-specific differences were observed in our in vitro experiments. The observed pazopanib resistance could be explained by receptor expression. Further investigation is required to determine TKI efficacy in HNSCC.",

We searched four electronic databases for published randomised controlled trials comparing selective VEGFR inhibitors with multikinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and carried out a meta-analysis. Outcomes of interest were progression-free survival, objective response rate (ORR), overall survival, discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events (DAE) and occurrence of specific toxicities.

Differentially expressed transcripts between trastuzumab-resistant and sensitive gastric cancer cell lines were annotated for functional interrelatedness by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.

Microarray analysis showed HER2 downregulation, induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and indicated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) as one of the top upregulated genes in N87-TR cell lines. In vitro, N87-TR cell lines demonstrated a higher sensitivity than did trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells to the FGFR3 inhibitor dovitinib, which reduced expression of pAKT, ZEB1, and cell migration. Oral dovitinib significantly (P = 0.0006) reduced tumor burden and prolonged mice survival duration in N87-TR mouse models.

Treatment of T-ALL cells with the SET antagonist OP449 restored the activity of PP2A and reduced SET interaction with the PP2A catalytic subunit, resulting in a decrease in cell viability and c-MYC expression in a dose-dependent manner.

We tested various T-ALL cell lines against a small-molecule inhibitor screen of 66 compounds targeting two-thirds of the tyrosine kinome and found that combined treatment of T-ALL cells with dovitinib, an orally active multi-targeted small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and OP449 synergistically reduced the viability of all tested T-ALL cell lines. Mechanistically, combined treatment with OP449 and dovitinib decreased total and phospho c-MYC levels and reduced ERK1/2, AKT, and p70S6 kinase activity in both NOTCH-dependent and independent T-ALL cell lines.

We cultured BaF3 cells overexpressing FGFR2 in high concentrations of dovitinib and identified 14 dovitinib-resistant mutations, including the N550K mutation observed in 25% of FGFR2(mutant) endometrial cancers (ECs). Structural and biochemical in vitro kinase analyses, together with BaF3 proliferation assays, showed that the resistance mutations elevate the intrinsic kinase activity of FGFR2. BaF3 lines were used to assess the ability of each mutation to confer cross-resistance to PD173074 and ponatinib. Unlike PD173074, ponatinib effectively inhibited all the dovitinib-resistant FGFR2 mutants except the V565I gatekeeper mutation, suggesting ponatinib but not dovitinib targets the active conformation of FGFR2 kinase. EC cell lines expressing wild-type FGFR2 were relatively resistant to all inhibitors, whereas EC cell lines expressing mutated FGFR2 showed differential sensitivity. Within the FGFR2(mutant) cell lines, three of seven showed marked resistance to PD173074 and relative resistance to dovitinib and ponatinib. This suggests that alternative mechanisms distinct from kinase domain mutations are responsible for intrinsic resistance in these three EC lines. Finally, overexpression of FGFR2(N550K) in JHUEM-2 cells (FGFR2(C383R)) conferred resistance (about five-fold) to PD173074, providing independent data that FGFR2(N550K) can be associated with drug resistance. Biochemical in vitro kinase analyses also show that ponatinib is more effective than dovitinib at inhibiting FGFR2(N550K).

Dovitinib bound to DNA as shown by its ability to increase the DNA melting temperature and by increases in its fluorescence spectrum that occurred upon the addition of DNA. Molecular modeling studies of the docking of dovitinib into an X-ray structure of a Hoechst 33258-DNA complex showed that dovitinib could reasonably be accommodated in the DNA minor groove.

Dovitinib inhibited the catalytic decatenation activity of topoisomerase II\u03b1. It also inhibited the DNA-independent ATPase activity of yeast topoisomerase II which suggested that it interacted with the ATP binding site. Using isolated human topoisomerase II\u03b1, dovitinib stabilized the enzyme-cleavage complex and acted as a topoisomerase II\u03b1 poison.

In conclusion, the cell growth inhibitory activity and the anticancer activity of dovitinib may result not only from its ability to inhibit multiple kinases, but also, in part, from its ability to target topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II.",

This phase 1 trial was conducted to characterize the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib plus dovitinib in patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Escalating dose cohorts of daily erlotinib and dovitinib dosed 5 days on/2 days off, starting after a 2-week lead-in of erlotinib alone, were planned. A potential pharmacokinetic interaction was hypothesized as dovitinib induces CYP1A1/1A2. Only cohort 1 (150 mg erlotinib+300 mg dovitinib) and cohort -1 (150 mg erlotinib+200mg dovitinib) enrolled. Plasma concentrations of erlotinib were measured pre- and post-dovitinib exposure. Two of three patients in cohort 1 had a DLT (grade 3 transaminitis and grade 3 syncope). Two of 6 patients in cohort -1 had a DLT (grade 3 pulmonary embolism and grade 3 fatigue); thus, the study was terminated. Erlotinib exposure (average Cmax 2308\u00b1698 ng/ml and AUC 0-24 41,030\u00b115,577 ng\u00d7h/ml) approximated previous reports in the six patients with pharmacokinetic analysis. However, erlotinib Cmax and AUC0-24 decreased significantly by 93% (p=0.02) and 97% (p&lt;0.01), respectively, during dovitinib co-administration. This small study demonstrated considerable toxicity and a significant pharmacokinetic interaction with a marked decrease in erlotinib exposure in the presence of dovitinib, likely mediated through CYP1A1/1A2 induction. Given the toxicity and the pharmacokinetic interaction, further investigation with this drug combination will not be pursued.",

Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of 2 FGFR inhibitors, the multikinase inhibitor dovitinib (TKI258) and the more selective FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398 for the treatment of endometrial cancer. We examined the effects of both inhibitors on tumor cell growth, FGFR2 signaling, cell cycle, and apoptosis using a panel of 20 molecularly characterized human endometrial cancer cell lines. Anchorage-independent growth was studied using soft agar assays. In vivo studies were conducted using endometrial cancer xenograft models. Cell lines with activating FGFR2 mutations (S252W, N550K) were more sensitive to dovitinib or NVP-BGJ398 when compared with their FGFR2 wild-type counterparts (P = 0.073 and P = 0.021, respectively). Both agents inhibited FGFR2 signaling, induced cell-cycle arrest, and significantly increased apoptosis in FGFR2-mutant lines. In vitro, dovitinib and NVP-BGJ398 were both potent at inhibiting cell growth of FGFR2-mutant endometrial cancer cells, but the activity of dovitinib was less restricted to FGFR2-mutant lines when compared with NVP-BGJ398. In vivo, dovitinib and NVP-BGJ398 significantly inhibited the growth of FGFR2-mutated endometrial cancer xenograft models. In addition, dovitinib showed significant antitumor activity in FGFR2 wild-type endometrial cancer xenograft models including complete tumor regressions in a long-term in vivo study. Dovitinib and NVP-BGJ398 warrant further clinical evaluation in patients with FGFR2-mutated endometrial cancer. Dovitinib may have antitumor activity in endometrial cancer beyond FGFR2-mutated cases and may permit greater flexibility in patient selection.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22180308": "The multiple kinase inhibitor dovitinib is currently under clinical investigation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated the mechanistic basis for the effects of dovitinib in HCCs. Dovitinib showed significant antitumor activity in HCC cell lines PLC5, Hep3B, Sk-Hep1, and Huh-7. Dovitinib downregulated phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) at tyrosine 705 and subsequently reduced the levels of expression of STAT3-related proteins Mcl-1, survivin, and cyclin D1 in a time-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of STAT3 abolished the apoptotic effect of dovitinib, indicating that STAT3 is indispensable in mediating the effect of dovitinib in HCC. SHP-1 inhibitor reversed downregulation of p-STAT3 and apoptosis induced by dovitinib, and silencing of SHP-1 by RNA interference abolished the effects of dovitinib on p-STAT3, indicating that SHP-1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, mediates the effects of dovitinib. Notably, dovitinib increased SHP-1 activity in HCC cells. Incubation of dovitinib with pure SHP-1 protein enhanced its phosphatase activity, indicating that dovitinib upregulates the activity of SHP-1 via direct interactions. In addition, dovitinib induced apoptosis in two sorafenib-resistant cell lines through inhibition of STAT3, and sorafenib-resistant cells showed significant activation of STAT3, suggesting that targeting STAT3 may be a useful approach to overcome drug resistance in HCC. Finally, in vivo, dovitinib significantly suppressed growth of both Huh-7 and PLC5 xenograft tumors and downregulated p-STAT3 by increasing SHP-1 activity. In conclusion, dovitinib induces significant apoptosis in HCC cells and sorafenib-resistant cells via SHP-1-mediated inhibition of STAT3.",

Recent evidence indicates that circRNAs play important roles in tissue development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. However, whether circRNAs encode functional proteins remains elusive, although translation of several circRNAs was recently reported. CircRNA deep sequencing was performed by using 10 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired adjacent normal brain tissues. Northern blotting, Sanger sequencing, antibody, and liquid chromatograph Tandem Mass Spectrometer were used to confirm the existence of circ-FBXW7 and its encoded protein in in two cell lines. Lentivirus-transfected stable U251 and U373 cells were used to assess the biological functions of the novel protein invitro and invivo (five mice per group). Clinical implications of circ-FBXW7 were assessed in 38 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired periphery normal brain tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (two-sided log-rank test). Circ-FBXW7 is abundantly expressed in the normal human brain (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads [RPKM] = 9.31). The spanning junction open reading frame in circ-FBXW7 driven by internal ribosome entry site encodes a novel 21-kDa protein, which we termed FBXW7-185aa. Upregulation of FBXW7-185aa in cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle acceleration, while knockdown of FBXW7-185aa promoted malignant phenotypes invitro and invivo. FBXW7-185aa reduced the half-life of c-Myc by antagonizing USP28-induced c-Myc stabilization. Moreover, circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa levels were reduced in glioblastoma clinical samples compared with their paired tumor-adjacent tissues (P &lt; .001). Circ-FBXW7 expression positively associated with glioblastoma patient overall survival (P = .03). Endogenous circRNA encodes a functional protein in human cells, and circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa have potential prognostic implications in brain cancer.",

We report here the tumorigenic capacity of a circRNA derived from angiomotin-like1 (circ-Amotl1). Circ-Amotl1 is highly expressed in patient tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Single-cell inoculations using circ-Amotl1-transfected tumor cells showed a 30-fold increase in proliferative capacity relative to control. Agarose colony-formation assays similarly revealed a 142-fold increase. Tumor-take rate in nude mouse xenografts using 6-day (219 cells) and 3-day (9 cells) colonies were 100%, suggesting tumor-forming potential of every cell. Subcutaneous single-cell injections led to the formation of palpable tumors in 41% of mice, with tumor sizes &gt;1 cm<sup>3</sup> in 1 month. We further found that this potent tumorigenicity was triggered through interactions between circ-Amotl1 and c-myc. A putative binding site was identified in silico and tested experimentally. Ectopic expression of circ-Amotl1 increased retention of nuclear c-myc, appearing to promote c-myc stability and upregulate c-myc targets. Expression of circ-Amotl1 also increased the affinity of c-myc binding to a number of promoters. Our study therefore reveals a novel function of circRNAs in tumorigenesis, and this subclass of noncoding RNAs may represent a potential target in cancer therapy.",

Pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain. This study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin at a dose of 150 mg per day that was adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day or matching placebo for up to 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the leg-pain intensity score on a 10-point scale (with 0 indicating no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) at week 8; the leg-pain intensity score was also evaluated at week 52, a secondary time point for the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the extent of disability, back-pain intensity, and quality-of-life measures at prespecified time points over the course of 1 year. A total of 209 patients underwent randomization, of whom 108 received pregabalin and 101 received placebo; after randomization, 2 patients in the pregabalin group were determined to be ineligible and were excluded from the analyses. At week 8, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.7 in the pregabalin group and 3.1 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.2 to 1.2; P=0.19). At week 52, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.4 in the pregabalin group and 3.0 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.3; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P=0.46). No significant between-group differences were observed with respect to any secondary outcome at either week 8 or week 52. A total of 227 adverse events were reported in the pregabalin group and 124 in the placebo group. Dizziness was more common in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group. Treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.

The efficacy, side effects (SE) profile and cost of PGB and GBP in neuropathic pain states were reviewed with special reference to sciatica. Eleven articles matched the criteria: seven systematic reviews, one retrospective cross-sectional study, one placebo-controlled-crossover study, one randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study and one case report. GBP and PGB appeared to demonstrate comparable efficacy and SE. However, the amount and quality of evidence was low, and only indirect comparisons were available. Importantly, no direct \"head-to-head\" study existed. Globally, costs varied widely (by up to 31 times) and unpredictably (PGB cheaper than GBP, or vice versa). Formulary regulator rulings were globally disparate; however, many exclusively favoured the more expensive drug (whether GBP or PGB). No studies assessed PGB-GBP interchange. Weak evidence suggests that efficacy and SE with GBP and PGB are probably similar; however, firm conclusions are precluded. Despite weak data, and having cited minor titration, but definite cost, advantages, UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence favoured PGB over GBP. Given that no evidence supports unhindered PGB-GBP interchange, neither drug should probably be favoured. Prospective \"head-to-head\" studies are urgently required to provide robust evidence-based knowledge for choice of GBP or PGB in sciatica.",

Gas vesicles-genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes-have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound. Their unique physical properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent physical stability. Furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mechanical, acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins. Here, we demonstrate that genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mechanical, acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific molecular targeting.

Application of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and comparative sequencing of the gene (speA) encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin) revealed that new waves of scarlet fever are associated with an increase in frequency of S. pyogenes clones carrying variant speA alleles.

S. pyogenes causes the widest range of disease in humans among all bacterial pathogens. It is responsible for various skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa and erysipelas, and localized mucous membrane infections of the oropharynx (e. g. tonsillitis and pharyngitis). Betahaemolytic group A Streptococcus causes also invasive diseases such as sepses including puerperal sepsis. Additionally, S. pyogenes induces toxin-mediated syndromes, i. e. scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF). STSS and NF are severe, frequently fatal diseases that have emerged in Europe and Northern America during the last two decades. Finally, some immunpathological diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis also result from S. pyogenes infections. Most scientists recommend penicillins (benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicllin) as drugs of first choice for treatment of Streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever. Erysipelas and some other skin infections should be treated with benzylpenicillin. Intensive care measurements are needed for treatment of severe toxin-mediated S. pyogenes diseases. These measurements include the elimination of internal bacterial foci, concomitant application of clindamycin and benzylpenicillin and suitable treatment of shock symptoms. Management of immunpathological diseases requires antiphlogistical therapy. Because of the wide distribution of S. pyogenes in the general population and the lack of an effective vaccine, possibilities for prevention allowing a suitable protection for diseases due to S. pyogenes are very limited.",

The reaction caused by this substance consists of a bright red local erythema, varying from 20 to 70 mm. in diameter, of 1 to 4 days duration. The severer reactions are moderately indurated and tender, and are followed bypigmentation and desquamation. Control injections in persons whose serums blanch the rash in scarlet fever cause no reaction. The toxic substance is not neutralized by mixture with a human serum which gives a negative blanching test but is readily neutralized by a human serum which gives a positive blanching test. It is not neutralized by normal horse serum, but is completely neutralized by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic serum. In a limited number of observations on the urine of patients with scarlet fever a similar toxic substance has been found in two out of five cases studied. Since the toxic substance described appears to resemble the toxic substance found in the filtrates of scarlatinal hemolytic streptococcus cultures by Dick and Dick and since it is neutralized not only by a blanching human serum but also by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic horse serum, the experiments reported support the conception that scarlet fever is a local infection of the throat by a particular type of Streptococcus haemolyticus capable of producing a toxin which is absorbed and is the cause of the general manifestations of the disease.",

Erythrogenic toxins and low molecular weight mitogens, inducing cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of these severe infections. Morphologically and culturally the strains isolated from cases of toxic shock-like syndrome cannot be differentiated from isolates of epidemic scarlet fever or sporadic cases. At the same time, when in Scandinavia an epidemic by S.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern Germany. Erythrogenic toxin type A or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for successful immunizations of rabbits. Another--antibacterial-immunization can be done with the M-protein of S.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity.

We found that less than 50% of the scarlet fever-associated strains possessed the speA gene as compared to 25% of the general group. Only 5 to 30% of these strains secreted the toxin under experimental conditions in very low quantities. Among strains isolated from TSLS, 67% appeared to contain the speA gene. The amount of ETA secreted into the medium was also extremely low. Southern hybridization patterns proved to be the same with an speA-specific probe in all three groups of streptococcal isolates (HaeIII, HindIII).

Occurrence of tonsillopharyngitis, scarlatina and rheumatic fever was analyzed and GAS carrier status in healthy children was examined over a 9-yr period from 1991 to 1999. Susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin was determined for 1657 GAS isolates obtained from patients diagnosed with pharyngitis or scarlet fever and 512 isolates from healthy carriers. M-type antigen was also determined in these isolates. The average incidences of tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever were 76.2 and 30.8 per cent respectively. A total of 166 cases of rheumatic fever were registered. Per cent of carriers varied from 5.5 to 11.4 per cent over the study period. Predominating M serotypes among GAS isolates tested were M1, M3, M4, M6, M11, M12 and M18, depending on the source of clinical material and period of isolation. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed susceptibility to penicillin in all isolates tested and resistance to erythromycin in 2.41 per cent of the isolates. Although the fluctuations in incidence were noted during the nine-year period, the incidence of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis is low but with a steady raise in Serbia. No significant changes in the incidence of scarlet fever and rheumatic fever were noted.

The experiment used 80 CB units: 40 were conventionally cryopreserved and the remainder were cryopreserved with a BioArchive. After thawing, the following measures of CB quality were compared: recovery rates of cell count, cell viability of total nucleated cells (TNCs), mononuclear cells (MNCs), and CD34+ cells, as well as colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) content. Additionally, processing and storage records were reviewed to quantify the number of exposures of CB units at room temperature (transient warming event, TWE), which was analyzed in relation to CB quality. MNC and CD34+ cell viability were as follows: MNC, 78.2% \u00b1 6.8% (conventional), 81.7% \u00b1 7.2% (automated); CD34+ cell, 90.6% \u00b1 6.9% (conventional), 94.7% \u00b1 3.5% (automated).

The CB quality comparison depending on the amount of TWEs showed no significant quality difference between groups that were more exposed to TWEs and groups that were less exposed. CBs cryopreserved with BioArchive were of higher quality than conventionally cryopreserved CBs, and the cause of quality difference might be due to the difference of freezing conditions rather than the TWE effect.",

Here we introduce a new WGS variant data format implemented in the R/Bioconductor package 'SeqArray' for storing variant calls in an array-oriented manner which provides the same capabilities as VCF, but with multiple high compression options and data access using high-performance parallel computing. Benchmarks using 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data show file sizes are 14.0 Gb (VCF), 12.3 Gb (BCF, binary VCF), 3.5 Gb (BGT) and 2.6 Gb (SeqArray) respectively.

For the allele frequency calculation, the implementation in the SeqArray package is over 5 times faster than PLINK v1.9 with VCF and BCF files, and over 16 times faster than vcftools.

Since the stability of the microbiota has been implicated in the development and modulation of mucosal immune responses, we hypothesized that the disruptive effect of the stressor upon the microbiota composition directly contributed to the stressor-induced exacerbation of pathogen-induced colitis. In order to establish a causative role for stressor-induced changes in the microbiota, conventional mice were exposed to prolonged restraint to change the microbiota. Germfree mice were then colonized by microbiota from either stressor-exposed or non-stressed control mice. One day after colonization, mice were infected with the colonic pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. At six days post-infection, mice that received microbiota from stressor-exposed animals had significant increases in colonic pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine (e.g. IL-1\u03b2) and chemokine (e.g. CCL2) levels after C. rodentium infection in comparison with mice that received microbiota from non-stressed mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that microbial communities from stressed mice did not have any detectable Bifidobacterium present, a stark contrast with the microbial communities from non-stressed mice, suggesting that stressor-induced alterations in commensal, immunomodulatory Bifidobacterium levels may predispose to an increased inflammatory response to pathogen challenge. This study demonstrates that the commensal microbiota directly contribute to excessive inflammatory responses to C. rodentium during stressor exposure, and may help to explain why gastrointestinal disorders are worsened during stressful experiences.",

EPEC and C. rodentium type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors repress innate immune responses and infiltration of immune cells. Inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1 and caspase-4/11 are crucial mediators of host defense and inflammation in the gut via their ability to process cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Here we report that the effector NleF binds the catalytic domain of caspase-4 and inhibits its proteolytic activity. Following infection of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) EPEC inhibited caspase-4 and IL-18 processing in an NleF-dependent manner. Depletion of caspase-4 in IECs prevented the secretion of mature IL-18 in response to infection with EPEC\u0394nleF. NleF-dependent inhibition of caspase-11 in colons of mice prevented IL-18 secretion and neutrophil influx at early stages of C. rodentium infection. Neither wild-type C. rodentium nor C. rodentium\u0394nleF triggered neutrophil infiltration or IL-18 secretion in Cas11 or Casp1/11-deficient mice.

RHIM-dependent interactions help drive a caspase-independent form of cell death termed necroptosis<sup>4,5</sup>. Here, we report that the bacterial pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) uses the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector EspL to degrade the RHIM-containing proteins RIPK1, RIPK3, TRIF and ZBP1/DAI during infection. This requires a previously unrecognized tripartite cysteine protease motif in EspL (Cys47, His131, Asp153) that cleaves within the RHIM of these proteins. Bacterial infection and/or ectopic expression of EspL leads to rapid inactivation of RIPK1, RIPK3, TRIF and ZBP1/DAI and inhibition of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), lipopolysaccharide or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-induced necroptosis and inflammatory signalling. Furthermore, EPEC infection inhibits TNF-induced phosphorylation and plasma membrane localization of mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL). In vivo, EspL cysteine protease activity contributes to persistent colonization of mice by the EPEC-like mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. The activity of EspL defines a family of T3SS cysteine protease effectors found in a range of bacteria and reveals a mechanism by which gastrointestinal pathogens directly target RHIM-dependent inflammatory and necroptotic signalling pathways.",

Using a CDI murine model, we compared the bacterial diversity of the gut microbiome of mice under different treatments including MK-3415A, vancomycin, or vancomycin combined with MK-3415A, sampled longitudinally. Here, we showed that <i>C. difficile</i> infection resulted in the prevalence of <i>Enterobacter</i> species. Sixty percent of mice in the vehicle group died after 2 days and their microbiome was almost exclusively formed by <i>Enterobacter</i>. MK-3415A treatment resulted in lower <i>Enterobacter</i> levels and restoration of <i>Blautia, Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> which were the core components of the original microbiota. Vancomycin treatment led to significantly lower survival rate than the combo treatment of MK-3415A and vancomycin.

A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics.

Furthermore, we show that FGF13 1A is a nucleolar protein that represses ribosomal RNA transcription and attenuates protein synthesis. Importantly, in cancer cells expressing high levels of FGF13, the depletion of FGF13 elicits increased proteostasis stress, associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. Notably, stepwise neoplastic transformation is accompanied by a gradual increase in FGF13 expression and increased dependence on FGF13 for survival (\"nononcogene addiction\"). Moreover, FGF13 overexpression enables cells to cope more effectively with the stress elicited by oncogenic Ras protein. We propose that, in cells in which activated oncogenes drive excessive protein synthesis, FGF13 may favor survival by maintaining translation rates at a level compatible with the protein quality-control capacity of the cell.

In Drosophila, the activity of the TGF\u03b2/Activin signalling branch has been linked to the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, but the cellular and molecular basis for these functions are not fully understood. In this study, we show that both the RII receptor Punt (Put) and the R-Smad Smad2 are strongly required for cell and tissue growth. Knocking down the expression of Put or Smad2 in salivary glands causes alterations in nucleolar structure and functions. Cells with decreased TGF\u03b2/Activin signalling accumulate intermediate pre-rRNA transcripts containing internal transcribed spacer 1 regions accompanied by the nucleolar retention of ribosomal proteins. Thus, our results show that TGF\u03b2/Activin signalling is required for ribosomal biogenesis, a key aspect of cellular growth control. Importantly, overexpression of Put enhanced cell growth induced by Drosophila Myc, a well-characterized inducer of nucleolar hypertrophy and ribosome biogenesis.",

We have previously identified a CUG initiated PTEN isoform designated PTEN\u03b1, which functions in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Here we report the identification of another N-terminal extended PTEN isoform, designated PTEN\u03b2. PTEN\u03b2 translation is initiated from an AUU codon upstream of and in-frame with the AUG initiation sequence for canonical PTEN. We show that the Kozak context and a downstream hairpin structure are critical for this alternative initiation. PTEN\u03b2 localizes predominantly in the nucleolus, and physically associates with and dephosphorylates nucleolin, which is a multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein. Disruption of PTEN\u03b2 alters rDNA transcription and promotes ribosomal biogenesis, and this effect can be reversed by re-introduction of PTEN\u03b2. Our data show that PTEN\u03b2 regulates pre-rRNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. These results demonstrate the complexity of the PTEN protein family and the diversity of its functions.",

As well-known, diabetes greatly increases cardiac vulnerability to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Nucleostemin (NS) is a nucleolar protein that controls ribosomal biogenesis and exerts cardioprotective effects against I/R injury. However, whether NS-mediated ribosomal biogenesis regulates ischemic vulnerability of diabetic hearts remains unanswered. Utilizing myocardial I/R mouse models, we found that cardiac NS expression significantly increased in response to I/R in normal diet (ND)-fed mice. Surprisingly, cardiac NS failed to be upregulated in high fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice, accompanied by obvious ribosomal dysfunction. Compared with ND group, cardiac specific overexpression of NS by adenovirus (AV) injection significantly restored I/R-induced ribosomal function enhancement, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, improved cardiac function, and decreased infarct sizes in diabetic mice. Notably, co-treatment of homoharringtonine (HHT), a selective inhibitor of ribosomal function, totally blocked NS-mediated cardioprotective effects against I/R injury. Furthermore, in cultured cardiomyocytes, saturated fatty acids treatment, but not high glucose exposure, significantly inhibited simulated I/R-induced NS upregulation and ribosomal function improvement. In conclusion, these data for the first time demonstrate that NS dysregulation induced by saturated fatty acids exposure might be an important cause of increased ischemic vulnerability to I/R injury in diabetic hearts. Targeting NS dysregulation and subsequent ribosomal dysfunction could be a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic I/R injury management.",

By producing ribosomes to fuel protein synthesis, it is tightly connected with cell growth and cell cycle control. Perturbation of ribosome biogenesis leads to the activation of p53 tumor suppressor protein promoting processes like cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence. This ribosome biogenesis stress pathway activates p53 through sequestration of MDM2 by a subset of ribosomal proteins (RPs), thereby stabilizing p53. Here, we identify human HEATR1, as a nucleolar protein which positively regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. Downregulation of HEATR1 resulted in cell cycle arrest in a manner dependent on p53. Moreover, depletion of HEATR1 also caused disruption of nucleolar structure and activated the ribosomal biogenesis stress pathway - RPL5 / RPL11 dependent stabilization and activation of p53. These findings reveal an important role for HEATR1 in ribosome biogenesis and further support the concept that perturbation of ribosome biosynthesis results in p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint activation, with implications for human pathologies including cancer.",

We and others have investigated the downstream effectors of 53BP1, including replication timing regulatory factor 1 (RIF1) and Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein (PTIP), in the past few years to elucidate how loss of the 53BP1-dependent repair pathway results in PARPi resistance in BRCA1 patients. However, questions regarding the upstream regulation of the 53BP1 pathway remain unanswered. In this study, we identified the Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR) that specifically associates with the ionizing radiation-induced foci formation region of 53BP1. 53BP1 and TIRR form a stable complex, which is required for their expression. Moreover, the 53BP1-TIRR complex dissociates after DNA damage, and this dissociation may be ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent. Similar to 53BP1, loss of TIRR restores PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. Collectively, our data identified a novel 53BP1-TIRR complex in DNA damage response. TIRR may play both positive and negative roles in 53BP1 regulation. On the one hand, it stabilizes 53BP1 and thus positively regulates 53BP1. On the other hand, its association with 53BP1 prevents 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, and thus TIRR is also an inhibitor of 53BP1.",

Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1.",

Moreover, p53 stimulates the topoisomerase I-induced recombination repair (TIRR) reaction. However, little was known about how p53 stimulates this topoisomerase I activity. Here we demonstrate that monomeric p53 is sufficient for the stimulation of the topoisomerase I-catalyzed relaxation activity, but the tetrameric form of p53 is required for the stimulation of TIRR. We also show that p53 stimulates topoisomerase I activity by increasing the dissociation of htopoI from DNA. Since htopoI forms a closed ring structure around the DNA, our results suggest that p53 induces a conformational change within htopoI that results in an opening of the clamp, and thereby releases htopoI from DNA.",

A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.",

Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to glioma cells have translated to only limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need also to target elements of the tumour microenvironment that promote glioma progression. Neuronal activity promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and clinically distinct HGG types, including adult and paediatric glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K-mTOR pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors prevent the release of NLGN3 into the tumour microenvironment and robustly block HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.",

They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10 years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis.

The GTP-dependent assembly cycle of FtsZ is thought to be crucial for the formation of the septal ring, which is highly regulated in time and space. We found that FtsZ accumulates in one of the phases and/or at the interface, depending on the system composition and on the oligomerization state of the protein. These results were observed both in bulk LLPS and in lipid-stabilized, phase-separated aqueous microdroplets. The visualization of the droplets revealed that both the location and structural arrangement of FtsZ filaments is determined by the nature of the LLPS. Relocation upon depolymerization of the dynamic filaments suggests the protein may shift among microenvironments in response to changes in its association state. The existence of these dynamic compartments driven by phase transitions can alter the local composition and reactivity of FtsZ during its life cycle acting as a nonspecific modulating factor of cell function.",

PNH is caused by somatic mutations in PIGA (which encodes phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A) in one or more HSC clones. The gene product of PIGA is required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors; thus, PIGA mutations lead to a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins, such as complement decay-accelerating factor (also known as CD55) and CD59 glycoprotein (CD59), which are both complement inhibitors. Clinical manifestations of PNH occur when a HSC clone carrying somatic PIGA mutations acquires a growth advantage and differentiates, generating mature blood cells that are deficient of GPI-anchored proteins. The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH. The accumulation of anaphylatoxins (such as C5a) from complement activation might also have a role. The natural history of PNH is highly variable, ranging from quiescent to life-threatening. Therapeutic strategies include terminal complement blockade and bone marrow transplantation. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody complement inhibitor, is highly effective and the only licensed therapy for PNH.",

Patients' T lymphocytes showed increased complement activation causing surface deposition of complement and the generation of soluble C5a. Costimulatory function and cytokine modulation by CD55 were defective. Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation.

This number remained relatively constant while the size of the vesicles increased until they attained their maximum diamtere of 100 nm. At this time the vesicles, interpreted as biconical structures, began to elongate presumably due to the synthesis of the cylindrical midsection. Closely correlated with the time at which vesicles began to elongate was the initiation of smaller vesicles which resulted in a doubling of the number of vesicles per cell by 90 min. This evidence coupled with the isolation of a mutant which assembles only the conical portions of the vesicle suggests that assembly occurs in two distinct stages subject to genetic mutation. Protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis, and presumably adenosine triphosphate formation, were required for gas vesicle assembly.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) appears to reduce the CVD consequences of OSA. Future research is expected to clarify the benefits and optimal application of these treatment approaches.",

Apart from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e.g. age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile. Concurrently, erectile dysfunction (ED) is a commonly neglected, potent marker of cardiovascular risk, which considerably worsens men's psychological state. Unrecognised or untreated ED results in substantial deterioration of the patient's therapeutic programme adherence. Because AF, OSA, and ED share multiple risk factors and clinical consequences, in 2013 the concept of their frequent concurrence - OSAFED syndrome - was proposed. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of OSAFED patients with AF in primary care practice. Retrospective analysis was carried out of data from primary care physician charts (NZOZ Esculap Gniewkowo, central Poland) including 1372 men aged 40-65 years. The primary goal was to determine the diagnosis of paroxysmal and/or perma-nent AF, which was followed by sleep apnoea screening (polygraphy) and erectile function evaluation (IIED-5 questionnaire). Twenty-one (1.5%) patients with documented AF were identified. Based on the sleep-polygraphic studies, 14 (67%) of them had confirmation of OSA with mean apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) equal to 27.5 \u00b1 17.1. Furthermore, 11 (52%) patients met the OSAFED syndrome criteria. Patients with OSAFED syndrome had a mean score in IIEF-5 of 11.6 \u00b1 3.5. The OSAFED-patients who were not diagnosed with all the of the syndrome components prior to the study-enrolment were characterised by substantially lower fat excess compared to their counterparts with already established OSAFED (body mass index: 30.1 \u00b1 4.9 vs. 37.7 \u00b1 3.9 kg/m\u00b2, respectively, p = 0.03). Frequently coexisting OSAFED syndrome components in all AF patients from the primary care setting should encourage a more active search for OSA and ED in patients with any documented form of AF. Most of the studied patients did not have the diagnosis of OSA nor ED done prior to participation in the study.",

These disordered breathing events are associated with a profile of perturbations that include intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, sympathetic activation, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which are critical mediators of cardiovascular disease. Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. Several discoveries in the pathogenesis, along with developments in the treatment of sleep apnea, have accumulated in recent years. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of sleep apnea, the evidence that addresses the links between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, and research that has addressed the effect of sleep apnea treatment on cardiovascular disease and clinical endpoints. Finally, we review the recent development in sleep apnea treatment options, with special consideration of treating patients with heart disease. Future directions for selective areas are suggested.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18024169": " Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. We have investigated whether different patterns of OSA are associated with specific arrhythmia during sleep. Electrocardiographic (ECG) data recorded during polysomnography (PSG) were analysed in 257 consecutive OSA patients to determine the prevalence of cardiac rhythm disturbances, and to relate these to breathing pattern (normal, apnea/hypopnea, recovering ventilation, snoring) and oxygen saturation. Arrhythmias were found in 18.5% of patients. Patients with nocturnal bradyarrhythmia (BA) had higher values of ventilatory disturbance (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 58.8+/-36.8 vs 37.2+/-30.3, p=0.02), mean desaturation amplitude (8.9+/-4 vs 5.9+/-3.4%, p=0.03), and a lower SaO(2) nadir (69% vs 77%, p=0.003) than those without arrhythmia. The prevalence of BA in patients with AHI&gt;or=30/h was significantly higher than that observed in those with AHI&lt;30/h (7.8% vs 1.5%, respectively; chi(2)=5.61, p=0.01). In contrast, patients with tachyarrhythmia (TA) had no significant differences in AHI, mean desaturation amplitude or SaO(2) nadir than those without arrhythmia. No associations were found between arrhythmia and the presence of comorbidity or concomitant medical therapy, except for an association between tachyarrhythmia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (odds ratio 2.53; 95% confidence intervals 1.1-5.8, p=0.03). We conclude that while BA during sleep is associated with OSA severity, concomitant COPD or beta(2)-treatment may play a role in the development of TA during sleep.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16149210": "Sleep-disordered breathing is very common and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia and stroke. There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive and central. The objective of this review is to provide a broad perspective of the pathophysiological and clinical aspects of the two types of apnea and to discuss their cardiovascular adverse effects. The diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome is based on polysomnography, and severity is measured with an apnea-hypopnea index that counts the total number of apneas per hour of sleep. Recent large epidemiologic studies have shown that sleep apnea affects about 16% of men and 5% of women between 30 and 65 years of age. Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by abnormal collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, snoring, vigorous inspiratory efforts causing frequent arousal, and excessive daytime drowsiness. Central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a form of periodic breathing with frequent periods of hyperventilation, and carries a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure. Obstructive apnea can also have substantial health consequences. Although the exact mechanism linking sleep apnea with cardiovascular disease is unknown, there is evidence that obstructive apnea is associated with a group of proinflammatory and prothrombic factors that are also important in the development of atherosclerosis. Nocturnal and daytime sympathetic activity is elevated after sleep apnea. Autonomic abnormalities include an increased resting heart rate, decreased cardiac rhythm activity, and increased blood pressure variability. Obstructive apnea is associated with endothelial dysfunction, increased C-reactive protein and cytokine expression, elevated fibrinogen levels and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Enhanced platelet activity and aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and accumulation of endothelial cells are common in both obstructive apnea and atherosclerosis. Surges in sympathetic activity, blood pressure, ventricular wall tension and afterload adversely affect ventricular function. Many studies have shown that patients with obstructive apnea have an increased incidence of daytime hypertension, and this syndrome is recognized as an independent risk factor for hypertension. Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Central sleep apnea is frequent in severe heart failure. Most heart failure patients with pulmonary congestion chronically hyperventilate because of stimulation of vagal irritant receptors and central and peripheral chemosensitivity. When PaCO2 falls below the threshold required to stimulate breathing, the central drive to respiratory muscles and air inflow ceases and central apnea ensues. Apnea, hypoxia, CO2 retention and arousals provoke elevated sympathetic activity, increased afterload and elevated left ventricular transmural pressure, and promote the progression of heart failure. Tentative relationships have been identified between central apnea and markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Recent mid-terms trials showed that nocturnal use of positive airway pressure in patients with the two types of apnea alleviates symptoms, reduces sympathetic activity, improves ventricular function and quality of life, and reduces daytime drowsiness. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but clinicians should be aware of this link and should attempt to identify patients with these syndromes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16293956": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Of these possible cardiovascular consequences, the association between OSA and hypertension has been found to be the most convincing. Although the exact mechanism has not been understood, there is some evidence that OSA is associated with frequent apneas causing mechanical effects on intrathoracic pressure, cardiac function, and intermittent hypoxemia, which may in turn cause endothelial dysfunction and increase in sympathetic drive. Therapy with continuous positive airway pressure has been demonstrated to improve cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in patients with OSA and may reverse the endothelial cell dysfunction. Despite the availability of diagnostic measures and effective treatment, many patients with sleep-disordered breathing remain undiagnosed. Therefore, OSA continues to be a significant health risk both for affected individuals and for the general public. Awareness and timely initiation of an effective treatment may prevent potential deleterious cardiovascular effects of OSA.",

Apnea- associated arrhythmia may contribute to sudden cardiac death and premature mortality in those patients. Both forms of sleep apnea excert strong modulatory effects on the autonomic system with a special autonomic profile. Profound vagal activity is leading to bradyarrhythmias, and sypathico-excitation to tachyarrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias in obstructive and central sleep apnea patients are mainly found in combination with cardiovascular comorbidity (coronary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, chronic heart failure). Bradyarrhythmias in OSA are induced by a cardioinhibitory vagal reflex due to obstructed airway. CPAP-therapy has been demonstrated to reduce arrhythmias.",

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the link between OSA and cardiac arrhythmias are not well established, they could be partially the same proposed mechanisms relating OSA to different cardiovascular diseases. OSA is characterized by repetitive pharyngeal collapse during sleep that leads to markedly reduced or absent airflow, followed by oxyhemoglobin desaturation, persistent inspiratory efforts against an occluded airway, and termination by arousal from sleep. These mechanisms elicit a variety of autonomic, hemodynamic, humoral, and neuroendocrine responses that by themselves evoke acute and chronic changes in cardiovascular function. These effects may lead to the development of cardiac arrhythmias and any other form of cardiovascular disease linked to OSA. The aims of this review are to describe the essential cardiovascular pathophysiological aspects of OSA, to outline the relationship between OSA and both tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and their possible influence in the natural history of OSA patients, and to assess the effects of OSA treatment on the presence of cardiac arrhythmias.",

Sleep was characterized by marked sinus arrhythmia in 14, extreme sinus bradycardia ( less than 30 beats/minute) in six, asystole of 2.5 to 6.3 seconds in five, second degree atrioventricular (A-V) block in two, and ventricular arrhythmias--complex premature ventricular beats in 10 and ventricular tachycardia in two. Arrhythmias during wakefulness were limited to premature ventricular beats in six. Atropine administration was partially and tracheostomy highly effective in preventing the majority of these arrhythmias during sleep. Marked sinus arrhythmia during sleep is characteristic of the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea and is frequently accompanied by potentially life-threatening tachy- and bradyarrhythmias.

The authors hypothesized that nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia occurs more frequently in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Objective: To analyze the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and abnormal heart rhythm during sleep in a population sample. Methods: Cross-sectional study with 1,101 volunteers, who form a representative sample of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. The overnight polysomnography was performed using an EMBLA\u00ae S7000 digital system during the regular sleep schedule of the individual. The electrocardiogram channel was extracted, duplicated, and then analyzed using a Holter (Cardio Smart\u00ae) system. Results: A total of 767 participants (461 men) with a mean age of 42.00 \u00b1 0.53 years, were included in the analysis. At least one type of nocturnal cardiac rhythm disturbance (atrial/ventricular arrhythmia or beat) was observed in 62.7% of the sample. The occurrence of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias was more frequent with increased disease severity. Rhythm disturbance was observed in 53.3% of the sample without breathing sleep disorders, whereas 92.3% of patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea showed cardiac arrhythmia. Isolated atrial and ventricular ectopy was more frequent in patients with moderate/severe obstructive sleep apnea when compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). After controlling for potential confounding factors, age, sex and apnea-hypopnea index were associated with nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia. Conclusion: Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia occurs more frequently in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and the prevalence increases with disease severity. Age, sex, and the Apnea-hypopnea index were predictors of arrhythmia in this sample.",

The question is what cardiovascular risk factors and how strongly they are associated with the severity of cardiac arrhythmias in sleep apnea. Adult males (33 with and 16 without sleep apnea), matched for cardiovascular co-morbidity were studied by polysomnography with simultaneous ECG monitoring. Arrhythmia severity was evaluated for each subject by a special 7-degree scoring system. Laboratory, clinical, echocardiographic, carotid ultrasonographic, ambulatory blood pressure, and baroreflex sensitivity values were also assessed. Moderate sleep apnea patients had benign, but more exaggerated cardiac arrhythmias than control subjects (2.53 \u00b1 2.49 vs. 1.13 \u00b1 1.64 degrees of cumulative severity, p &lt; 0.05). We confirmed strong correlations between the arrhythmia severity and known arrhythmogenic risk factors (left ventricular ejection fraction and dimensions, right ventricular diameter, baroreflex sensitivity, carotid intima-media thickness, age, previous myocardial infarction, and also apnea-hypopnea index). In multivariate modelling only the apnea-hypopnea index indicating the sleep apnea intensity remained highly significantly correlated with the cumulative arrhythmia severity (beta = 0.548, p &lt; 0.005). In conclusion, sleep apnea modifying cardiovascular risk factors and structures or functions provoked various nocturnal arrhythmias. The proposed scoring system allowed a complex analysis of the contribution of various triggers to arrhythmogenesis and confirmed the apnea-hypopnea index as an independent risk for nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia severity in sleep apnea.",

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with OSA in Singapore and to evaluate possible factors that may predispose patients with OSA to arrhythmias. A retrospective study of 2,019 patients was carried out from January 2011 to December 2012 at a sleep center in a tertiary medical center. Of the population, 1,457 patients were found to have OSA and 144 patients were found to have cardiac arrhythmias. Data collected included patient demographics, comorbidities, and polysomnogram parameters. The prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias in our OSA population is 8.0%, compared to that of primary snorers at 4.8% (<i>P</i> = .015). The univariate analysis revealed that older age, higher body mass index, comorbidities, and severity of OSA, including apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), lowest oxygen saturation (LSAT) and hypoxic time were correlated with a higher prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). However, the multivariate analysis showed that only age and body mass index were significantly correlated with arrhythmias. AHI, LSAT, and hypoxic time were no longer statistically significant. Our study demonstrated that cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA in Singapore.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction. Hypoglossal motoneurons, which innervate extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, play a key role in maintaining the patency of the upper airway and in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Based on data obtained by using extracellular recording techniques, there is a consensus that hypoglossal motoneurons cease to discharge during rapid eye movement sleep, because they are disfacilitated. Since other somatic motoneurons are known to be postsynaptically inhibited during rapid eye movement sleep, we sought to determine, by the use of intracellular recording techniques during cholinergically induced rapid eye movement sleep, whether postsynaptic inhibitory mechanisms act on hypoglossal motoneurons. We found that, during this state, a powerful glycinergic premotor inhibitory system acts to suppress hypoglossal motoneurons. This finding opens new avenues for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and provides a foundation to explore the neural and pharmacological control of respiration-related motoneurons during rapid eye movement sleep.",

This process is insufficiently understood, cannot be efficiently counteracted and calls for novel means of treatment. The endocytic collagen receptor, uPARAP/Endo180, is expressed on various mesenchymal cell types and is involved in bone matrix turnover during normal bone growth. Human osteosarcoma specimens showed strong expression of this receptor on tumour cells, along with the collagenolytic metalloprotease, MT1-MMP. In advanced tumours with ongoing bone degeneration, sarcoma cells positive for these proteins formed a contiguous layer aligned with the degradation zones. Remarkably, osteoclasts were scarce or absent from these regions and quantitative analysis revealed that this scarcity marked a strong contrast between osteosarcoma and bone metastases of carcinoma origin. This opened the possibility that sarcoma cells might directly mediate bone degeneration. To examine this question, we utilized a syngeneic, osteolytic bone tumour model with transplanted NCTC-2472 sarcoma cells in mice. When analysed in vitro, these cells were capable of degrading the protein component of surface-labelled bone slices in a process dependent on MMP activity and uPARAP/Endo180. Systemic treatment of the sarcoma-inoculated mice with a mouse monoclonal antibody that blocks murine uPARAP/Endo180 led to a strong reduction of bone destruction. Our findings identify sarcoma cell-resident uPARAP/Endo180 as a central player in the bone degeneration of advanced tumours, possibly following an osteoclast-mediated attack on bone in the early tumour stage. This points to uPARAP/Endo180 as a promising therapeutic target in osteosarcoma, with particular prospects for improved neoadjuvant therapy.",

We have previously demonstrated that its unique collagenolytic activity is modulated by glycosaminoglycans that form high molecular weight complexes with the protease. However, mutational analysis of a specific glycosaminoglycan-cathepsin K binding site only led to a 60% reduction of the collagenolytic activity suggesting additional glycosaminoglycan binding sites or other determinants controlling this activity. We identified eight cathepsin K specific arginine/lysine residues that form three positively charged clusters at the bottom part of the protease opposing the active site. These residues are highly conserved among mammalian, avian, and reptilian cathepsin K orthologues and to a lesser degree in amphibian and fish specimens. Mutational analysis of these residues revealed an approximately 50% reduction of the collagenolytic activity when the basic amino acids in cluster 2 (K103, K106, R108, R111) were mutated into alanine residues and resulted in a 100% loss of this activity when the mutations were expanded into cluster 3 (K122, R127). Cluster 1 mutations (K77, R79) had no effect. A partial rescue effect was observed when the hexamutant variant was combined with three mutations in the previously identified glycosaminoglycan binding site (N190, K101, L195K) indicating the relevance of at least two independent interaction sites. Amino acid substitutions in all sites had no effect on the catalytic efficacy of the protease variants as reflected in their unaltered peptidolytic and gelatinolytic activities and their overall protein stabilities. This study suggests that the basic amino acid clusters in cathepsin K are involved in alternative glycoasaminoglycan binding sites, play other roles in the formation of collagenolytically active protease complexes, or contribute in a yet unknown manner to the specific binding to collagen.",

Since this phenotype was even more severe in src(-/-)hck(-/-) mice, we examined the individual contribution of Hck in bone homeostasis. Compared to wt mice, hck(-/-) mice exhibited an osteopetrotic phenotype characterized by an increased density of trabecular bone and decreased bone degradation, although osteoclastogenesis was not impaired. Podosome organization and matrix degradation were found to be defective in hck(-/-) osteoclast precursors (preosteoclast) but were normal in mature hck(-/-) osteoclasts, probably through compensation by Src, which was specifically overexpressed in mature osteoclasts. As a consequence of podosome defects, the 3-dimensional migration of hck(-/-) preosteoclasts was strongly affected in vitro. In vivo, this translated by altered bone homing of preosteoclasts in hck(-/-) mice: in metatarsals of 1-wk-old mice, when bone formation strongly depends on the recruitment of these cells, reduced numbers of osteoclasts and abnormal developing trabecular bone were observed. This phenotype was still detectable in adults. In summmary, Hck is one of the very few effectors of preosteoclast recruitment described to date and thereby plays a critical role in bone remodeling.",

For resorption to occur, the sealing zone must be coherent and stable for extended periods of time. Using titanium roughness gradients ranging from 1 to 4.5 \u00b5m R(a) as substrates for osteoclast adhesion, we show that microtopographic obstacles of a length scale well beyond the range of the 'footprint' of an individual podosome can slow down sealing-zone expansion. A clear inverse correlation was found between ring stability, structural integrity and sealing-zone translocation rate. Direct live-cell microscopy indicated that the expansion of the sealing zone is locally arrested by steep, three-dimensional 'ridge-like barriers', running parallel to its perimeter. It was, however, also evident that the sealing zone can bypass such obstacles, if pulled by neighbouring regions, extending through flanking, obstacle-free areas. We propose that sealing-zone dynamics, while being locally regulated by surface roughness, are globally integrated via the associated actin cytoskeleton. The effect of substrate roughness on osteoclast behaviour is significant in relation to osteoclast function under physiological and pathological conditions, and may constitute an important consideration in the design of advanced bone replacements.",

Bromodomain-containing protein 2 (Brd2), which belongs to the bromodomain and extraterminal domain family of proteins, suppresses adipocyte differentiation. DNA methylation is critical for several differentiation processes and possibly in adipocyte differentiation. However, whether DNA methylation regulates the expression of Brd2 is not clear. In our study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation contributes to the regulation of Brd2 expression during pre-adipocyte differentiation. Brd2 mRNA levels were low in pre-adipocytes, increased in early adipocytes, and declined in mature adipocytes. To test whether and how Brd2 expression is regulated by DNA methylation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes to adipocytes, cells were cultured in the presence of the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza). Pre-adipocytes and adipocytes exposed to 5-Aza exhibited a dose-dependent increase in Brd2 transcription levels, while only mature adipocytes exhibited increased expression of Brd2 protein. Subsequently, we tested the DNA methylation status of the Brd2 promoter region. Bisulfite-sequencing analysis revealed that six CpG sites in two predicted promoters of Brd2 were demethylated in early adipocytes and highly methylated in mature adipocytes. Digestion of bisulfite-converted PCR products of the Brd2 promoter region from 3T3-L1 cells with BstU1 (CGGC) revealed that the demethylation rate of the Brd2 promoter was consistent with Brd2 mRNA expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. In conclusion, DNA demethylation of the Brd2 promoter region induced Brd2 expression during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes.",

And the BET inhibitor JQ1 has been proven to be effective in suppressing multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This study aimed to examine the therapeutic potential of JQ1 on a lupus model, MRL-lpr mice. Ten-week-old MRL-lpr mice were treated with JQ1 (oral administration of 200mg/kg) or vehicle for 8weeks. The proteinuria, nephritic damage, serum biochemistry, autoantibodies and cytokines were examined. Splenocytes of MRL-lpr mice were isolated for in vitro experiments. Treatment with JQ1 significantly attenuated the progression of proteinuria and nephritis. The serum concentrations of anti-dsDNA antibody as well as B-cell activating factor (BAFF), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17 and INF-\u03b3 were inhibited, and IL-10 augmented by JQ1. Importantly, JQ1 improved the survival of lupus mice. In vitro, BAFF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17 and INF-\u03b3 were inhibited, and IL-10 augmented by JQ1 (500nM) in the cultures of splenocytes from diseased MRL-lpr mice, which was further supported by a significant reduction in immune complex-mediated activation of human monocytes in vitro by JQ1. Taken together, JQ1 effectively alleviates lupus in MRL-lpr mice by suppressing BAFF, pro-inflammatory cytokines and autoimmunity, supporting the therapeutic value of JQ1 in lupus disease.",

They are present in unicellular eukaryotes and in this study, the role of the BET protein Bdf1 has been explored in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutation of Bdf1 bromodomains revealed defects on both the formation of spores and the meiotic progression, blocking cells at the exit from prophase, before the first meiotic division. This phenotype is associated with a massive deregulation of the transcription of meiotic genes and Bdf1 bromodomains are required for appropriate expression of the key meiotic transcription factor NDT80 and almost all the Ndt80-inducible genes, including APC complex components. Bdf1 notably accumulates on the promoter of Ndt80 and its recruitment is dependent on Bdf1 bromodomains. In addition, the ectopic expression of NDT80 during meiosis partially bypasses this dependency. Finally, purification of Bdf1 partners identified two independent complexes with Bdf2 or the SWR complex, neither of which was required to complete sporulation. Taken together, our results unveil a new role for Bdf1 -working independently from its predominant protein partners Bdf2 and the SWR1 complex-as a regulator of meiosis-specific genes.",

Using a screen of small molecule epigenetic probes we identified three compounds which inhibited myogenic differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts; (+)-JQ1, PFI-1, and Bromosporine. These molecules target Bromodomain and Extra Terminal domain (BET) proteins, which are epigenetic readers of acetylated histone lysine tail residues. BETi-mediated anti-myogenic effects were also observed in a model of MYOD1-mediated myogenic conversion of human fibroblasts, and in primary mouse and human myoblasts. All three BET proteins BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 exhibited distinct and dynamic patterns of protein expression over the course of differentiation without concomitant changes in mRNA levels, suggesting that BET proteins are regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Specific BET protein knockdown by RNA interference revealed that BRD4 was required for myogenic differentiation, whereas BRD3 down-regulation resulted in enhanced myogenic differentiation. ChIP experiments revealed a preferential binding of BRD4 to the Myog promoter during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, co-incident with increased levels of H3K27 acetylation. These results have identified an essential role for BET proteins in the regulation of skeletal myogenesis, and assign distinct functions to BRD3 and BRD4.",

Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors have been shown to effectively ameliorate pathological fibrotic responses. However, the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of these inhibitors in renal fibrosis remain elusive. In this study, we determined that the inhibition of Brd4, a BET family member, with a selective potent chemical inhibitor, JQ1, could prevent the development of renal fibrosis and block the progression of fibrosis in rats that have undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Inhibiting Brd4 with either JQ1 or genetic knockdown resulted in decreased expression of fibrotic genes such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV and fibronectin both in UUO-induced fibrosis and upon TGF-\u03b21 stimulation in HK-2 cells. Brd4 inhibition also suppressed the oxidative stress induced by UUO in vivo or by TGF-\u03b21 in HK-2 cells. Moreover, Nox4, which is constitutively active in renal cells and is involved in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, was up-regulated during UUO-mediated fibrosis and induced by TGF-\u03b21 in HK-2 cells, and this up-regulation could be blunted by Brd4 inhibition. Consistently, Nox4-mediated ROS generation and fibrotic gene expression were attenuated upon Brd4 inhibition. Further, the transcriptional activity of Nox4 was suppressed by JQ1 or siRNA against Brd4. Additionally, Smad3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are upstream signals of Nox4 expression, were inhibited both in JQ1-administered UUO rats and Brd4-inhibited HK-2 cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that the inhibition of Brd4 might protect against renal fibrosis by blocking the TGF-\u03b2-Nox4-ROS-fibrosis axis, suggesting that Brd4 could be a promising therapeutic target.",

AD pathology is also characterized by chronic brain inflammation, which promotes disease pathogenesis. In this context, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a highly specialized endothelial cell membrane that lines cerebral microvessels, represents the interface between neural cells and circulating cells of the immune system. The BBB thus plays a key role in the generation and maintenance of chronic inflammation during AD. The BBB operates within the neurovascular unit (NVU), which includes clusters of glial cells, neurons and pericytes. The NVU becomes dysfunctional during AD, and each of its components may undergo functional changes that contribute to neuronal injury and cognitive deficit. In transgenic animals with AD-like pathology, recent studies have shown that circulating leukocytes migrate through the activated brain endothelium when certain adhesion molecules are expressed, penetrating into the brain parenchyma, interacting with the NVU components and potentially affecting their structural integrity and functionality. Therefore, migrating immune system cells in cerebral vessels act in concert with the modified BBB and may be integrated into the dysfunctional NVU. Notably, blocking the adhesion mechanisms controlling leukocyte-endothelial interactions inhibits both A\u03b2 deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, and reduces memory loss in AD models. The characterization of molecular mechanisms controlling vascular inflammation and leukocyte trafficking could therefore help to determine the basis of BBB dysfunction during AD and may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches.",

It is widely known that disruption of the BBB occurs in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Annexin A1 (ANXA1), an anti-inflammatory messenger, is expressed in brain endothelial cells and regulates the BBB integrity. However, its role and mechanism for protecting BBB in AD have not been identified. We found that \u03b2-Amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b242)-induced BBB disruption was rescued by human recombinant ANXA1 (hrANXA1) in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3. Also, ANXA1 was decreased in the bEnd.3 cells, the capillaries of 5XFAD mice, and the human serum of patients with AD.

Nonetheless, circulating sclerostin levels in humans often reflect changes in the bone microenvironment, although there may be exceptions to this observation. Using existing assays, circulating sclerostin levels have been shown to be altered in response to both hormonal stimuli and across a variety of normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In both rodents and humans, parathyroid hormone provided either intermittently or continuously suppresses sclerostin levels. Likewise, most evidence from both human and animal studies supports a suppressive effect of estrogen on sclerostin levels. Efforts to examine non-hormonal/systemic regulation of sclerostin have in general shown less consistent findings or have provided associations rather than direct interventional information, with the exception of mechanosensory studies which have consistently demonstrated increased sclerostin levels with skeletal unloading, and conversely decreases in sclerostin with enhanced skeletal loading. Herein, we will review the existent literature on both hormonal and non-hormonal/systemic factors which have been studied for their impact on sclerostin regulation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742498": "After discovering that lack of Sost/sclerostin expression is the cause of the high bone mass human syndromes Van Buchem disease and sclerosteosis, extensive animal experimentation and clinical studies demonstrated that sclerostin plays a critical role in bone homeostasis and that its deficiency or pharmacological neutralization increases bone formation. Dysregulation of sclerostin expression also underlies the pathophysiology of skeletal disorders characterized by loss of bone mass, as well as the damaging effects of some cancers in bone. Thus, sclerostin has quickly become a promising molecular target for the treatment of osteoporosis and other skeletal diseases, and beneficial skeletal outcomes are observed in animal studies and clinical trials using neutralizing antibodies against sclerostin. However, the anabolic effect of blocking sclerostin decreases with time, bone mass accrual is also accompanied by anti-catabolic effects, and there is bone loss over time after therapy discontinuation. Further, the cellular source of sclerostin in the bone/bone marrow microenvironment under physiological and pathological conditions, the pathways that regulate sclerostin expression and the mechanisms by which sclerostin modulates the activity of osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts remain unclear. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge on the regulation of Sost/sclerotin expression and its mechanism(s) of action, discuss novel observations regarding its role in signaling pathways activated by hormones and mechanical stimuli in bone, and propose future research needed to understand the full potential of therapeutic interventions that modulate Sost/sclerostin expression.",

Since sclerostin is expressed in vivo by mineral-embedded osteocytes, we tested the hypothesis that sclerostin would regulate the behavior of cells actively involved in mineralization in adult bone, the preosteocyte. Differentiating cultures of human primary osteoblasts exposed to recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) for 35 days displayed dose- and time-dependent inhibition of in vitro mineralization, with late cultures being most responsive in terms of mineralization and gene expression. Treatment of advanced (day 35) cultures with rhSCL markedly increased the expression of the preosteocyte marker E11 and decreased the expression of mature markers DMP1 and SOST. Concomitantly, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) expression was increased by rhSCL at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas PHEX was decreased, implying regulation through the MEPE-ASARM axis. We confirmed that mineralization by human osteoblasts is exquisitely sensitive to the triphosphorylated ASARM-PO4 peptide. Immunostaining revealed that rhSCL increased the endogenous levels of MEPE-ASARM. Importantly, antibody-mediated neutralization of endogenous MEPE-ASARM antagonized the effect of rhSCL on mineralization, as did the PHEX synthetic peptide SPR4. Finally, we found elevated Sost mRNA expression in the long bones of HYP mice, suggesting that sclerostin may drive the increased MEPE-ASARM levels and mineralization defect in this genotype. Our results suggest that sclerostin acts through regulation of the PHEX/MEPE axis at the preosteocyte stage and serves as a master regulator of physiologic bone mineralization, consistent with its localization in vivo and its established role in the inhibition of bone formation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23737439": "The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide. These findings suggest a new role for sclerostin in the regulation of perilacunar mineral by osteocytes.",

The expression of sclerostin is largely restricted to osteocytes although its mode of transcriptional regulation is not well understood. We observed regulated expression of sclerostin mRNA and protein that was directly correlated with the mineralization response in cultured human Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells and rat primary calvarial cells. Sclerostin mRNA and protein levels were increased following treatment of cells with BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7. Analysis of deletion mutants from the -7.4 kb upstream region of the human sclerostin promoter did not reveal any specific regions that were responsive to BMPs, Wnt3a, PTH, TGF\u03b21 or Activin A in Saos-2 cells. The downstream ECR5 element did not show enhancer activity in Saos-2 cells and also was not affected when Saos-2 cells were treated with BMPs or PTH. Genome-wide microarray analysis of Saos-2 cells treated with BMP2 showed significant changes in expression of several transcription factors with putative consensus DNA binding sites in the region of the sclerostin promoter. However, whereas most factors tested showed either a range of inhibitory activity (DLX family, MSX2, HEY1, SMAD6/7) or lack of activity on the sclerostin promoter including SMAD9, only MEF2B showed a positive effect on both the promoter and ECR5 element. These results suggest that the dramatic induction of sclerostin gene expression by BMPs in Saos-2 cells occurs indirectly and is associated with late stage differentiation of osteoblasts and the mineralization process.",

Sclerostin secreted by osteocytes is mechanosensory and important in bone remodeling. However, little is known regarding the role of sclerostin in tooth movement. In this study, models of experimental tooth movement were established in rats and mice. Sclerostin expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry staining, and osteoclastic activity was analyzed with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells underwent uniaxial compression and tension stress or were cultured in hypoxia conditions. Expression of sclerostin was assessed by RT-qPCR and ELISA. MLO-Y4 cells were cultured with recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) interference and then co-cultured with RAW264.7 osteoclast precursor cells. Expressions of RANKL and OPG were analyzed by RT-qPCR, and osteoclastic activity was assessed by TRAP staining. During tooth movement, sclerostin was expressed differently in compression and tension sites. In SOST knock-out mice, there were significantly fewer TRAP-positive cells than in WT mice during tooth movement in compression sites. In-vitro studies showed that the expression of sclerostin in MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells was not different under a uniaxial compression and tension force, whereas hypoxia conditions significantly increased sclerostin expression in MLO-Y4 cells. rhSCL interference increased the expression of RANKL and the RANKL/OPG ratio in MLO-Y4 cells and the osteoclastic induction ability of MLO-Y4 cells in experimental osteocyte-osteoclast co-culture. These data suggest that sclerostin plays an important role in the bone remodeling of tooth movement.",

We compared serum levels of TGF-\u03b21 and sclerostin in pre- and postmenopausal women and assessed the potential correlations of these levels with each other and with serum levels of bone turnover markers and bone mineral density. A total of 176 women (58 premenopausal, 62 early postmenopausal, and 56 late postmenopausal) were included in this study. Serum TGF-\u03b21 level was significantly higher in early postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal (32.0\u00b17.19 vs. 26.55\u00b16.67 ng/ml, p=0.01) and late postmenopausal (32.0\u00b17.19 vs. 28.65\u00b17.70 pg/ml, p=0.031) women, and no significant differences in serum sclerostin levels were observed among the 3 groups. There was a significant negative correlation between TGF-\u03b21 and sclerostin in early postmenopausal women, but not in other groups of women. Based on multiple regression analysis, only TGF-\u03b21 (\u03b2=-0.362; p=0.007) was an independent predictor of sclerostin during early postmenopause. Our findings suggest that serum TGF-\u03b21 level increases during postmenopause and declines in old age. Sclerostin production is inhibited by TGF-\u03b21 during early postmenopause.",

We examined the association between circulating sclerostin together with bone turnover markers and osteoporosis-related fracture risk in 707 postmenopausal women, in a population-based study with a mean follow-up period of 5.2 \u00b1 1.3 years. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze fracture risk, adjusted for age, body mass index, and other confounding risk factors. High sclerostin levels were strongly associated with increased fracture risk. After adjustment for age and other confounders, the relative fracture risk was more than sevenfold among postmenopausal women for each 1-SD increment increase in sclerostin level. Women in the highest quartile of sclerostin levels had about a 15-fold increase in fracture risk. Results were similar when we compared sclerostin at the 1-year visit to an average of two to three annual measurements. Fracture risk attributable to sclerostin levels was 56.6% in the highest quartile. Only high levels of bone resorption markers (plasma cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen [p-CTx], urinary CTx [u-CTx], and urinary N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen [u-NTx]) were predictive of osteoporosis-related fractures but at much lower hazard ratio (HR) values than that of serum sclerostin.

It has been demonstrated that Wnt signaling through the secretion of Wnt inhibitors, such as DKK1, sFRP-2, and sFRP-3, plays a key role in the decreased osteoblast activity associated with multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease. We provide evidence that sclerostin is expressed by myeloma cells that are human myeloma cell lines and plasma cells (CD138(+) cells) obtained from the bone marrow (BM) of a large number of MM patients with bone disease. Moreover, we show that there are no differences in sclerostin serum levels between MM patients and controls.

Currently, there is little information on circulating sclerostin levels among postmenopausal women with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with VFs in relation to serum IGF-1 (s-IGF-1). We investigated the relationships between serum sclerostin, s-IGF-1, and VFs in postmenopausal women with T2DM. We assessed cross-sectionally 482 postmenopausal women with T2DM and 482 age-matched postmenopausal women without T2DM who were recruited at diabetic clinics and primary health care centers for inclusion in a bone health survey. The main outcome measures were serum sclerostin, s-IGF-1, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers. Lateral X-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine were taken to diagnose VFs. Serum sclerostin levels were increased, whereas s-IGF-1 levels were decreased when T2DM women were stratified by the number of VFs (P&lt;0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that serum sclerostin levels were positively associated with 1 VF (odds ratio [OR]=1.27, (95% CI:1.01-2.03), P=0.016), 2 VFs (OR=1.41, (95% CI:1.03-2.36), P=0.006), and \u22653 VFs (OR=1.54, (95% CI:1.12-2.44) P=0.005). s-IGF-1 levels were inversely associated with 1 VF (OR=0.58, (95% CI:0.39-0.88), P=0.041), 2 VFs (OR=0.42, (95% CI:0.21-0.90), P=0.012), and \u22653 VFs (OR=0.19, (95% CI: 0.14-0.27), P&lt;0.001).

However, the physiological role of sclerostin remains to be elucidated. Sclerostin was intensely expressed in developing bones of mouse embryos. Punctuated expression of sclerostin was localized on the surfaces of both intramembranously forming skull bones and endochondrally forming long bones. Sclerostin-positive cells were identified as osteoclasts. Recombinant sclerostin protein produced in cultured cells was efficiently secreted as a monomer. We examined effects of sclerostin on the activity of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 for mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Sclerostin inhibited the BMP6 and BMP7 activity but not the BMP2 and BMP4 activity. Sclerostin bound to BMP6 and BMP7 with high affinity but bound to BMP2 and BMP4 with lower affinity. In conclusion, sclerostin is a novel secreted osteoclast-derived BMP antagonist with unique ligand specificity. We suggest that sclerostin negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts induced by BMPs. Since sclerostin expression is confined to the bone-resorbing osteoclast, it provides a mechanism whereby bone apposition is inhibited in the vicinity of resorption. Our findings indicate that sclerostin plays an important role in bone remodeling and links bone resorption and bone apposition.",

The columns were extensively washed with low ionic strength buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 1M sodium chloride.

We asked whether a Sirt1-activating compound could rescue ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss and biomechanical deterioration in 9-week-old C57BL/6 mice. OVX resulted in a substantial decrease in skeletal Sirt1 expression accompanied by an increase in sclerostin. Oral administration of SRT3025, a Sirt1 activator, at 50 and 100 mg/kg\u00b7d for 6 weeks starting 6 weeks after OVX fully reversed the deleterious effects of OVX on vertebral bone mass, microarchitecture, and femoral biomechanical properties.

To test this we treated human primary pre-osteocyte cultures, cells we have found are exquisitely sensitive to sclerostin, or mouse osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells, with recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) and measured effects on pro-catabolic gene expression. Sclerostin dose-dependently up-regulated the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) mRNA and down-regulated that of osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA, causing an increase in the RANK:OPG mRNA ratio. To examine the effects of rhSCL on resulting osteoclastic activity, MLO-Y4 cells plated onto a bone-like substrate were primed with rhSCL for 3 days and then either mouse splenocytes or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were added. This resulted in cultures with elevated osteoclastic resorption (approximately 7-fold) compared to untreated co-cultures. The increased resorption was abolished by co-addition of recombinant OPG. In co-cultures of MLO-Y4 cells with PBMC, SCL also increased the number and size of the TRAP-positive multinucleated cells formed. Importantly, rhSCL had no effect on TRAP-positive cell formation from monocultures of either splenocytes or PBMC. Further, rhSCL did not induce apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells, as determined by caspase activity assays, demonstrating that the osteoclastic response was not driven by dying osteocytes. Together, these results suggest that sclerostin may have a catabolic action through promotion of osteoclast formation and activity by osteocytes, in a RANKL-dependent manner.",

The relation between time-varying sScl and mortality with a 4-year follow-up period was investigated using crude and adjusted Cox regression models. Linear mixed models were used for longitudinal measurements of sScl. The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) age of 396 test subjects was 63.6 (\u00b113.9 years), 61.6% were male and the median follow-up was 2.9 years. Subjects with the highest sScl had a lower mortality risk than those with the lowest concentrations [adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.31-0.86, P = 0.01)]. Stratified models showed a stable sScl in patients treated with HD (\u0394 +2.9 pmol/L/year, 95% CI -0.5 to +6.3, P = 0.09) and a decreasing concentration in those treated with HDF (\u0394 -4.5 pmol/L/year, 95% CI -8.0 to -0.9, P = 0.02). The relative change in the latter group was related to the magnitude of the convection volume. (i) A high sScl is associated with a lower mortality risk in patients with end-stage kidney disease; (ii) treatment with HDF causes sScl to fall; and (iii) the relative decline in patients treated with HDF is dependent on the magnitude of the convection volume.",

Particularly, this enzyme is involved in repair of damages to single-strand DNA, thus decreasing the chances of generating double-strand breaks in the genome. Therefore, the concept to block PARP enzymes by PARP inhibitor (PARPi) was appreciated in cancer treatment. PARPi has been designed and tested for many years and became a potential supplement for the conventional chemotherapy. However, increasing evidence indicates the appearance of the resistance to this treatment. Specifically, cancer cells may acquire new mutations or events that overcome the positive effect of these drugs. This paper describes several molecular mechanisms of PARPi resistance which were reported most recently, and summarizes some strategies to reverse this type of drug resistance.",

PARP interacts directly, indirectly or via PARylation with various oncogenic proteins and regulates several transcription factors thereby modulating carcinogenesis. Therapeutic inhibition of PARP is therefore perceived as a promising anticancer strategy and a number of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are currently under development and clinical evaluation. PARPi inhibit the DNA repair pathway and thus form the concept of synthetic lethality in cancer therapeutics. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown the potential of PARPi as chemopotentiator, radiosensitizer, or as adjuvant therapeutic agents. Recent studies have shown that PARP-1 could be either oncogenic or tumor suppressive in different cancers. PARP inhibitor resistance is also a growing concern in the clinical setting. Recently, changes in the levels of PARP-1 activity or expression in cancer patients have provided the basis for consideration of PARP-1 regulatory proteins as potential biomarkers. This review focuses on the current developments related to the role of PARP in cancer progression, therapeutic strategies targeting PARP-associated oncogenic signaling, and future opportunities in use of PARPi in anticancer therapeutics.",

However, emerging data have also shown that even BRCA-mutant cells may be resistant to PARPi. The mechanistic basis for these drug resistances is poorly understood. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of many cell-cycle events, is significantly elevated upon castration of mice carrying xenograft prostate tumors. Herein, by combination with Plk1 inhibitor BI2536, we show a robust sensitization of olaparib in 22RV1, a BRCA1-deficient CRPC cell line, as well as in CRPC xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, monotherapy with olaparib results in an override of the G<sub>1</sub>-S checkpoint, leading to high expression of Plk1, which attenuates olaparib's overall efficacy. In BRCA1 wild-type C4-2 cells, Plk1 inhibition also significantly increases the efficacy of olaparib in the presence of p53 inhibitor. Collectively, our findings not only implicate the critical role of Plk1 in PARPi resistance in BRCA-mutant CRPC cells, but also shed new light on the treatment of non-BRCA-mutant patient subgroups who might also respond favorably to PARPi. <i>Mol Cancer Ther; 16(3); 469-79. \u00a92017 AACR</i>.",

Activation of MC1R in melanocytes by \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) stimulates cAMP signalling and melanin production and enhances DNA repair after ultraviolet irradiation. Individuals carrying MC1R variants, especially those associated with red hair colour, fair skin and poor tanning ability (denoted as RHC variants), are associated with higher risk of melanoma. However, how MC1R activity is modulated by ultraviolet irradiation, why individuals with red hair are more prone to developing melanoma, and whether the activity of RHC variants might be restored for therapeutic benefit are unknown. Here we demonstrate a potential MC1R-targeted intervention strategy in mice to rescue loss-of-function MC1R in MC1R RHC variants for therapeutic benefit by activating MC1R protein palmitoylation. MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using C57BL/6J-Mc1r<sup>e/e</sup>J mice, in which endogenous MC1R is prematurely terminated, expressing Mc1r RHC variants, we show that pharmacological activation of palmitoylation rescues the defects of Mc1r RHC variants and prevents melanomagenesis.

Genome-wide studies have revealed that mRNA levels are associated with genetic variation in or close to the gene coding for those mRNA transcripts - cis effects, and elsewhere in the genome - trans effects. The role of genetic variation in determining protein levels has not been systematically assessed. Using a genome-wide association approach we show that common genetic variation influences levels of clinically relevant proteins in human serum and plasma. We evaluated the role of 496,032 polymorphisms on levels of 42 proteins measured in 1200 fasting individuals from the population based InCHIANTI study. Proteins included insulin, several interleukins, adipokines, chemokines, and liver function markers that are implicated in many common diseases including metabolic, inflammatory, and infectious conditions. We identified eight Cis effects, including variants in or near the IL6R (p = 1.8x10(-57)), CCL4L1 (p = 3.9x10(-21)), IL18 (p = 6.8x10(-13)), LPA (p = 4.4x10(-10)), GGT1 (p = 1.5x10(-7)), SHBG (p = 3.1x10(-7)), CRP (p = 6.4x10(-6)) and IL1RN (p = 7.3x10(-6)) genes, all associated with their respective protein products with effect sizes ranging from 0.19 to 0.69 standard deviations per allele. Mechanisms implicated include altered rates of cleavage of bound to unbound soluble receptor (IL6R), altered secretion rates of different sized proteins (LPA), variation in gene copy number (CCL4L1) and altered transcription (GGT1). We identified one novel trans effect that was an association between ABO blood group and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels (p = 6.8x10(-40)), but this finding was not present when TNF-alpha was measured using a different assay , or in a second study, suggesting an assay-specific association. Our results show that protein levels share some of the features of the genetics of gene expression. These include the presence of strong genetic effects in cis locations. The identification of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) may be a powerful complementary method of improving our understanding of disease pathways.",

Yet the impact of genetic variation, including eQTLs, on protein levels remains poorly understood. To address this, we mapped genetic variants that are associated with eQTLs, ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). We found that most QTLs are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, which suggests that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we identified a class of cis QTLs that affect protein abundance with little or no effect on messenger RNA or ribosome levels, which suggests that they may arise from differences in posttranslational regulation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480033": "Gene expression levels can be subject to selection. We hypothesized that the age of gene origin is associated with expression constraints, given that it affects the level of gene integration into the functional cellular environment. By studying the genetic variation affecting gene expression levels (cis expression quantitative trait loci [cis-eQTLs]) and protein levels (cis protein QTLs [cis-pQTLs]), we determined that young, primate-specific genes are enriched in cis-eQTLs and cis-pQTLs. Compared to cis-eQTLs of old genes originating before the zebrafish divergence, cis-eQTLs of young genes have a higher effect size, are located closer to the transcription start site, are more significant, and tend to influence genes in multiple tissues and populations. These results suggest that the expression constraint of each gene increases throughout its lifespan. We also detected a positive correlation between expression constraints (approximated by cis-eQTL properties) and coding constraints (approximated by Ka/Ks) and observed that this correlation might be driven by gene age. To uncover factors associated with the increase in gene-age-related expression constraints, we demonstrated that gene connectivity, gene involvement in complex regulatory networks, gene haploinsufficiency, and the strength of posttranscriptional regulation increase with gene age. We also observed an increase in heritability of gene expression levels with age, implying a reduction of the environmental component. In summary, we show that gene age shapes key gene properties during evolution and is therefore an important component of genome function.",

Assigning function to genetic variants as expression quantitative trait loci is an expanding and useful approach, but focuses exclusively on mRNA rather than protein levels. Many variants remain without annotation. To address this problem, we measured the steady state abundance of 441 human signaling and transcription factor proteins from 68 Yoruba HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines to identify novel relationships between inter-individual protein levels, genetic variants, and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Proteins were measured using micro-western and reverse phase protein arrays from three independent cell line thaws to permit mixed effect modeling of protein biological replicates. We observed enrichment of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for cellular sensitivity to two commonly used chemotherapeutics: cisplatin and paclitaxel. We functionally validated the target protein of a genome-wide significant trans-pQTL for its relevance in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. GWAS overlap results of drug-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity for paclitaxel and cisplatin revealed unique SNPs associated with the pharmacologic traits (at p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, GWAS SNPs from various regions of the genome implicated the same target protein (p&lt;0.0001) that correlated with drug induced cytotoxicity or apoptosis (p \u2264 0.05). Two genes were functionally validated for association with drug response using siRNA: SMC1A with cisplatin response and ZNF569 with paclitaxel response. This work allows pharmacogenomic discovery to progress from the transcriptome to the proteome and offers potential for identification of new therapeutic targets.

In ARIEL2, we assessed the ability of tumour genomic LOH, quantified with a next-generation sequencing assay, to predict response to rucaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor. ARIEL2 is an international, multicentre, two-part, phase 2, open-label study done at 49 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Canada, France, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In ARIEL2 Part 1, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma were classified into one of three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups on the basis of tumour mutational analysis: BRCA mutant (deleterious germline or somatic), BRCA wild-type and LOH high (LOH high group), or BRCA wild-type and LOH low (LOH low group). We prespecified a cutoff of 14% or more genomic LOH for LOH high. Patients began treatment with oral rucaparib at 600 mg twice per day for continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or any other reason for discontinuation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All patients treated with at least one dose of rucaparib were included in the safety analyses and all treated patients who were classified were included in the primary endpoint analysis.

Tumours from 12 patients were established as BRCA wild-type, but could not be classified for LOH, because of insufficient neoplastic nuclei in the sample. The median duration of treatment for the 204 patients was 5\u00b77 months (IQR 2\u00b78-10\u00b71). 24 patients in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 56 patients in the LOH high subgroup, and 59 patients in the LOH low subgroup had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival after rucaparib treatment was 12\u00b78 months (95% CI 9\u00b70-14\u00b77) in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 5\u00b77 months (5\u00b73-7\u00b76) in the LOH high subgroup, and 5\u00b72 months (3\u00b76-5\u00b75) in the LOH low subgroup.

Common serious adverse events included small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant neoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anaemia (nine [4%]). Three patients died during the study (two because of disease progression and one because of sepsis and disease progression). No treatment-related deaths occurred. In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas.

Rucaparib was found to be relatively well tolerated in clinical trials, with the most common adverse events being anemia, fatigue, and nausea. Rucaparib appears to be a safe and effective new option in the treatment of relapsed, advanced BRCA1/2 mutant ovarian cancer. The role of rucaparib in this setting will likely expand and be further elucidated as results from several ongoing studies become available.",

We studied the growth inhibitory effects of rucaparib in a panel of 39 ovarian cancer cell lines that were each characterized for mutation and methylation status of BRCA1/2, baseline gene expression signatures, copy number variations of selected genes, PTEN status, and sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. To study interactions with chemotherapy, we used multiple drug effect analyses and assessed apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and \u03b3H2AX formation. Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of rucaparib were seen in 26 of 39 (67%) cell lines and were not restricted to cell lines with BRCA1/2 mutations. Low expression of other genes involved in homologous repair (e.g., BCCIP, BRCC3, ATM, RAD51L1), amplification of AURKA or EMSY, and response to platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with sensitivity to rucaparib. Drug interactions with rucaparib were synergistic for topotecan, synergistic, or additive for carboplatin, doxorubicin or paclitaxel, and additive for gemcitabine. Synergy was most pronounced when rucaparib was combined with topotecan, which resulted in enhanced apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and \u03b3H2AX formation. Importantly, rucaparib potentiated chemotherapy independent of its activity as a single agent. PARP inhibition may be a useful therapeutic strategy for a wider range of ovarian cancers bearing deficiencies in the homologous recombination pathway other than just BRCA1/2 mutations. These results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.",

In this trial we assessed rucaparib versus placebo after response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 hospitals and cancer centres across 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma, had received at least two previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, had achieved complete or partial response to their last platinum-based regimen, had a cancer antigen 125 concentration of less than the upper limit of normal, had a performance status of 0-1, and had adequate organ function. Patients were ineligible if they had symptomatic or untreated central nervous system metastases, had received anticancer therapy 14 days or fewer before starting the study, or had received previous treatment with a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. We randomly allocated patients 2:1 to receive oral rucaparib 600 mg twice daily or placebo in 28 day cycles using a computer-generated sequence (block size of six, stratified by homologous recombination repair gene mutation status, progression-free interval after the penultimate platinum-based regimen, and best response to the most recent platinum-based regimen). Patients, investigators, site staff, assessors, and the funder were masked to assignments. The primary outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival evaluated with use of an ordered step-down procedure for three nested cohorts: patients with BRCA mutations (carcinoma associated with deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations), patients with homologous recombination deficiencies (BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and high loss of heterozygosity), and the intention-to-treat population, assessed at screening and every 12 weeks thereafter.

Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or higher in the safety population (372 [99%] patients in the rucaparib group vs 189 [100%] in the placebo group) were reported in 209 (56%) patients in the rucaparib group versus 28 (15%) in the placebo group, the most common of which were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin concentration (70 [19%] vs one [1%]) and increased alanine or aspartate aminotransferase concentration (39 [10%] vs none). Across all primary analysis groups, rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

The quality of therapeutic and diagnostic allergen products largely depends on the allergen and iso-allergen composition. Several biochemical methods are currently applied to detect and quantify allergens and to record protein profiles without differentiating between iso-allergens. Mass spectrometry (MS) may entirely replace these technologies, as it allows sequence specific identification and quantification of proteins and protein profiles including sequence variants in one run. However, the protein inference problem still hampers the automatic assignment of peptide sequences to proteins, consequently impeding the quantification of sequence variants. Therefore, the aim of the study was to set up semitargeted analyses of label-free MS data that allow unambiguous identification and quantification of birch pollen allergens and nonallergenic proteins. We combined data independent acquisition with manual assignment of predefined target sequences for quantification of iso-allergens and automatic quantification of other allergens and nonallergenic proteins. The quantitative data for birch pollen allergens and sequence variants of Bet v 1 were further confirmed by multiple reaction monitoring.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26935399": "In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, protein quantification and protein identification are two major computational problems. To quantify the protein abundance, a list of proteins must be firstly inferred from the raw data. Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimated with quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, most researchers have been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, the protein inference problem can be regarded as a special protein quantification problem in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins whose abundance values are not zero. Some recent published papers have conceptually discussed this possibility. However, there is still a lack of rigorous experimental studies to test this hypothesis. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Protein inference methods aim to determine whether each candidate protein is present in the sample or not. Protein quantification methods estimate the abundance value of each inferred protein. Naturally, the abundance value of an absent protein should be zero. Thus, we argue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special protein quantification problem in which one protein is considered to be present if its abundance is not zero. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three simple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem effectively. The experimental results on six data sets show that these three methods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms. This demonstrates that it is plausible to model the protein inference problem as a special protein quantification task, which opens the door of devising more effective protein inference algorithms from a quantification perspective.

The objective of protein inference is to find a subset of proteins that are truly present in the sample. Although many methods have been proposed for protein inference, several issues such as peptide degeneracy still remain unsolved. In this article, we present a linear programming model for protein inference. In this model, we use a transformation of the joint probability that each peptide/protein pair is present in the sample as the variable. Then, both the peptide probability and protein probability can be expressed as a formula in terms of the linear combination of these variables. Based on this simple fact, the protein inference problem is formulated as an optimization problem: minimize the number of proteins with non-zero probabilities under the constraint that the difference between the calculated peptide probability and the peptide probability generated from peptide identification algorithms should be less than some threshold. This model addresses the peptide degeneracy issue by forcing some joint probability variables involving degenerate peptides to be zero in a rigorous manner.

In this paper, we propose a reformulation of the protein inference problem by utilizing the recently introduced concept of peptide detectability.

The results of various studies including cohort, prospective, retrospective and small number case reports indicate that lithium is a \"weak\" teratogen in humans. The main effects attributable to lithium are, cardiac malformations and babies with increased birth weight. There is a possibility that, in particular, lithium may be associated with the Ebstein anomaly but present evidence cannot definitely affirm or deny this association. Animal studies with lithium using doses comparable to human therapeutic serum levels have not reported any abnormalities. However, higher doses have produced exencephaly, skeletal and craniofacial defects and abnormalities of blood vessel development. Experiments with other vertebrates have shown that lithium affects dorsoventral specification and inhibition of vasculogenesis. Both these effects can be prevented by pretreatment with myo-inositol indicating that lithium interferes with the phosphatidyl inositol cycle.

In the meantime sufficient data are available concerning the use of anti-depressants during pregnancy to exclude any serious damage to the fetus or newborn. As a basic principle, a monotherapy should be favoured and the drug applicated in the lowest efficient dose. Due to the SSRI's side effect profile the choice of the antidepressant should be done in favour of serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants. For both substance groups there is no hint for any teratogenic potential. Benzodiazepine should be prescribed with caution. Negative long term effects to the newborn cannot be excluded. Based on few available data, indeed, there exists no reservation against the use of St. John's wort during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Total prevalence rose over time from 0.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.41) to 0.48 (95% CI 0.40-0.57) (p&lt;0.01). In all, nine cases were exposed to maternal mental health conditions/medications (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) 2.64, 95% CI 1.33-5.21) compared with cardiac controls. Cases were more likely to be exposed to maternal \u03b2-thalassemia (adjOR 10.5, 95% CI 3.13-35.3, n=3) and haemorrhage in early pregnancy (adjOR 1.77, 95% CI 0.93-3.38, n=11) compared with cardiac controls. The increasing prevalence of Ebstein's anomaly may be related to better and earlier diagnosis. Our data suggest that Ebstein's anomaly is associated with maternal mental health problems generally rather than lithium or benzodiazepines specifically; therefore, changing or stopping medications may not be preventative. We found new associations requiring confirmation.",

An additional retrospective study on 59 cases found seven anomalies, four of them being cardiac. On the other hand, none of the prospective studies (296 liveborn infants) demonstrated any increase in the rate of congenital anomalies, although two had Ebstein's anomaly. All case control studies regarding Ebstein's anomaly were negative, and among 222 infants with Ebstein's anomaly and 44 with tricuspid atresia none of the mothers had taken lithium during pregnancy. Considering the serious limitations of the retrospective and case control studies that are also retrospective, lithium does not seem to be a significant teratogen, and hence should be given, if indicated, in pregnancy.

Prevention of bleeds in patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors is less effective and there is ongoing research for alternative treatment options. A promising approach in 2016 is the development of emicizumab (ACE910), a bi-specific IgG antibody to factor IXa and factor X, that mimics the cofactor function of factor VIII. Due to the different structure of this antibody it cannot be neutralized by factor VIII inhibitors and has the possibility to achieve haemostasis in patients with severe haemophilia A with and without inhibitors. First studies in healthy volunteers and in patients showed a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time and increased peak height of thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner. The half-life of the drug was 4 to 5 weeks. There were no clinical signs of thrombosis and no laboratory abnormalities indicating hypercoagulability. In a first study with 18 patients with severe haemophilia A with and without inhibitors a remarkable reduction in the annualised bleeding rate occurred.

It transmits several human pathogens, including the agents of human monocytic ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and southern tick-associated rash illness. Blood-feeding insects (Class Insecta) depend on bacterial endosymbionts to provide vitamins and cofactors that are scarce in blood. It is unclear how this deficiency is compensated in ticks (Class Arachnida) that feed exclusively on mammalian blood. A bacterium related to Coxiella burnetii, the agent of human Q fever, has been observed previously within cells of A. americanum. Eliminating this bacterium (CLEAA, Coxiella-like endosymbiont of A. americanum) with antibiotics reduced tick fecundity, indicating that it is an essential endosymbiont. In an effort to determine its role within this symbiosis, we sequenced the CLEAA genome. While highly reduced (656,901 bp) compared with C. burnetii (1,995,281 bp), the CLEAA genome encodes most major vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis pathways, implicating CLEAA as a vitamin provisioning endosymbiont. In contrast, CLEAA lacks any recognizable virulence genes, indicating that it is not a pathogen despite its presence in tick salivary glands. As both C. burnetii and numerous \"Coxiella-like bacteria\" have been reported from several species of ticks, we determined the evolutionary relationship between the two bacteria. Phylogeny estimation revealed that CLEAA is a close relative of C. burnetii, but was not derived from it. Our results are important for strategies geared toward controlling A. americanum and the pathogens it vectors, and also contribute novel information regarding the metabolic interdependencies of ticks and their nutrient-provisioning endosymbionts.",

The infection progression and IgG antibody responses in deer were similar to those observed with transmission feeding of ticks acquiring infection by natural blood feeding. The pathogen infections acquired by natural tick transmission and by feeding needle-infected ticks on animals were also similar to intravenous infections in causing persistent infections.

To investigate the mechanism by which DEP leads to increased UBQLN protein levels, we identified and interrogated microRNAs that were predicted to regulate UBQLN mRNA. We found that DEP decreases the oncogenic microRNA, MIR155. Further, we showed that MIR155 regulates the mRNA of UBQLN1 and UBQLN2 in cells, such that increased MIR155 expression increased cell invasion, migration, wound formation and clonogenicity in UBQLN-loss dependent manner. This is the first report of an environmental carcinogen regulating expression of UBQLN proteins. We show that exposure of cells to DEP causes an increase in UBQLN levels and that MIR155 regulates mRNA of UBQLN.

We show that Ubiquilin family proteins bind transmembrane domains in the cytosol to prevent aggregation and temporarily allow opportunities for membrane targeting. Over time, Ubiquilins recruit an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate bound clients. The attached ubiquitin engages Ubiquilin's UBA domain, normally bound to an intramolecular UBL domain, and stabilizes the Ubiquilin-client complex. This conformational change precludes additional chances at membrane targeting for the client, while simultaneously freeing Ubiquilin's UBL domain for targeting to the proteasome. Loss of Ubiquilins by genetic ablation or sequestration in polyglutamine aggregates leads to accumulation of non-inserted mitochondrial membrane protein precursors.

The ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of UBQLN is required for its association with autophagosomes as well as for its prosurvival functions.Remarkably, during starvation-induced autophagy, UBQLN promotes the fusion of early autophagosomes with lysosomes.Overall, this work illustrates an important function for UBQLN in cell survival during nutrient starvation, which requires a newly recognized function for UBQLN in autophagosome maturation.",

Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only. Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model achieves a good accuracy (78% for 10 categories; 92% for membrane-bound or soluble), outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms, including those relying on homology information. The method is available as a web server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc. Example code is available at https://github.com/JJAlmagro/subcellular_localization.

The bug was recently introduced into the U.S. and could potentially become a pest. In its native range, H. halys was reportedly attracted to the aggregation pheromone of the brown-winged green bug, Plautia stali, methyl (2 E,4 E,6 Z)-decatrienoate. We also observed that traps baited with this compound are attractive to H. halys. We additionally found that methyl (2 E,4 E,6 Z)-decatrienoate (as well as other isomeric methyl 2,4,6-decatrienoates) exposed to daylight in solutions and/or on dispensers used for field trapping can readily isomerize to form complex mixtures of isomers, thus causing a concern about lure stability and longevity. However, our studies demonstrated that preventing isomerization of methyl (2 E,4 E,6 Z)-decatrienoate in dispensers was not essential for field trapping of H. halys males, females, and nymphs. We also present evidence that traps baited with methyl (2 Z,4 E,6 Z)-decatrienoate and methyl (2 E,4 Z,6 Z)-decatrienoate (pheromone of Thyanta spp. pentatomids), as well as the mixtures of geometric isomers, attract H. halys. The ZEZ isomer, unknown in nature, as well as the EEZ isomer, elicited electrophysiological responses from antennae of H. halys males. The field data suggest that the presence of the EEZ but not ZEZ isomer in the lure is essential for attraction of H. halys, and that other isomers are not antagonistic and may even be needed for maximum attraction. Because the pheromone of H. halys is unknown at present, lures containing methyl (2 E,4 E,6 Z)-decatrienoate without protection from daylight are suitable for monitoring populations of H. halys late in the season.",

After US populations were shown to originate from Northern China, others have tried to source BMSB populations now in Canada, Switzerland, Italy, France, Greece, and Hungary. Due to selection of different molecular markers, however, integrating all the datasets to obtain a broader picture of BMSB's expansion has been difficult. To address this limitation we focused on a single locus, the barcode region in the cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial gene, and analyzed representative BMSB samples from across its current global range using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach. We found that China is the likely source of most non-native populations, with at least four separate introductions in North America and three in Europe.

The highly polyphagous nature of this insect as well as its vast dispersal capabilities, require an integrated approach to management. Here we focus on the potential impact of indigenous natural enemies on <i>H. halys</i> in woody ornamental nurseries in Maryland, USA. We sampled naturally field laid <i>H. halys</i> egg masses for mortality and parasitism rates in 2012 and 2013. Overall, egg mortality averaged 54% for both years, and increased within season and between years. The largest source of mortality was from egg parasitoids with mean parasitism rates of 30.73 and 39.63% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Mortality from predation was much lower and averaged 4.61% by chewing and 2.53% by sucking predators.

H. halys was first detected in the USA in the mid 1990s, dispersing to over 41 other states. Since 1998, H. halys has spread throughout New Jersey, becoming an important pest of agriculture, and a major nuisance in urban developments. In this study, we used spatial analysis, geostatistics, and Bayesian linear regression to investigate the invasion dynamics and colonization processes of this pest in New Jersey. We present the results of monitoring H. halys from 51 to 71 black light traps that were placed on farms throughout New Jersey from 2004 to 2011 and examined relationships between total yearly densities of H. halys and square hectares of 48 landscape/land use variables derived from urban, wetland, forest, and agriculture metadata, as well as distances to nearest highways. From these analyses we propose the following hypotheses: (1) H. halys density is strongly associated with urban developments and railroads during its initial establishment and dispersal from 2004 to 2006; (2) H. halys overwintering in multiple habitats and feeding on a variety of plants may have reduced the Allee effect, thus facilitating movement into the southernmost regions of the state by railroads from 2005 to 2008; (3) density of H. halys contracted in 2009 possibly from invading wetlands or sampling artifact; (4) subsequent invasion of H. halys from the northwest to the south in 2010 may conform to a stratified-dispersal model marked by rapid long-distance movement, from railroads and wetland rights-of-way; and (5) high densities of H. halys may be associated with agriculture in southern New Jersey in 2011.

The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is a highly polyphagous Asian herbivore and an economically important invasive pest in North America and Europe. In visual surveys of 220 plant taxa in commercial nurseries in Maryland, USA, H. halys was more abundant on non-Asian plants and selected these over Asian plants. The relationship between the relative use of plants and their availability was strongly positive but depended also on plant origin at two of our three sites, where the higher relative use of non-Asian plants was greatest for highly abundant taxa. These results highlight the importance of considering both plant origin and relative abundance in understanding the selection of host plants by invasive generalist herbivores in diverse, natural and urban forests.",

Despite the economic importance of pentatomid pests worldwide, their feeding behavior is poorly understood. Electronically monitored insect feeding (EMIF) technology is a useful tool in studies of feeding behavior of Hemiptera. Here we examined H. halys feeding behavior using an EMIF system designed for high throughput studies in environmental chambers. Our objectives were to quantify feeding activity by monitoring proboscis contacts with green beans, including labial dabbing and stylet penetration of the beans, which we collectively define as 'probes'. We examined frequency and duration of 'probes' in field-collected H. halys over 48 hours and we determined how environmental conditions could affect diel and seasonal periodicity of 'probing' activity. We found differences in 'probing' activity between months when the assays were conducted. These differences in activity may have reflected different environmental conditions, and they also coincide with what is known about the phenology of H. halys. While a substantial number of 'probes' occurred during scotophase, including some of the longest mean 'probe' durations, activity was either lower or similar to 'probing' activity levels during photophase on average. We found that temperature had a significant impact on H. halys 'probing' behavior and may influence periodicity of activity. Our data suggest that the minimal temperature at which 'probing' of H. halys occurs is between 3.5 and 6.1 \u00b0C (95% CI), and that 'probing' does not occur at temperatures above 26.5 to 29.6 \u00b0C (95% CI).

To date, no study has investigated the applicability of these monitoring tools for use indoors by building residents during the overwintering period. Herein, we 1) assessed when in late winter (diapause) and spring (postdiapause) H. halys begins to respond to its pheromone (10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol), 2) evaluated whether pheromone-based tools can be used reliably for monitoring H. halys adults in unheated and heated buildings, and 3) elucidated the potential for indoor management using pheromone-baited traps. A 2-yr trapping study suggested that H. halys began to respond reliably to pheromone-baited traps after a critical photoperiod of 13.5 h in the spring. Captures before that point were not correlated with visual counts of bugs in buildings despite robust populations, suggesting currently available pheromone-baited traps were ineffective for surveillance of diapausing H. halys. Finally, because baited traps captured only 8-20% of the adult H. halys known to be present per location, they were not an effective indoor management tool for overwintering H. halys.

Climate change will add further complications to managing this species in terms of both geographic distribution and population growth. This study used CLIMEX to compare potential H. halys distribution under recent and future climate models using one emission scenario (A2) with two different global circulation models, CSIRO Mk3.0 and MIROC-H. Simulated changes in seasonal phenology and voltinism were examined. Under the possible future climate scenarios, suitable range in Europe expands northward. In North America, the suitable H. halys range shifts northward into Canada and contracts from its southern temperature range limits in the United States due to increased heat stress. Prolonged periods of warm temperatures resulted in longer H. halys growing seasons. However, future climate scenarios indicated that rising summer temperatures decrease H. halys growth potential compared to recent climatic conditions, which in turn, may reduce mid-summer crop damage. Climate change may increase the number of H. halys generations produced annually, thereby enabling the invasive insect to become multivoltine in the northern latitudes of North America and Europe where it is currently reported to be univoltine. These results indicate prime horticultural production areas in Europe, the northeastern United States, and southeastern Canada are at greatest risk from H. halys under both current and possible future climates.",

Effects of cold temperatures such as mortality and freezing have yet to be quantified in the invading population.

Individual roles of matrix components have not been completely elucidated in vitro or in vivo To examine individual functions, strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the murine model of S Typhi, in which various ECM genes were deleted or added, were created to examine biofilm formation, colonization, and persistence in the gallbladder. Studies show that curli contributes most significantly to biofilm formation. Expression of Vi antigen decreased biofilm formation in vitro and virulence and bacterial survival in vivo without altering the examined gallbladder pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Oppositely, loss of all ECM components (\u0394wcaM \u0394csgA \u0394yihO \u0394bcsE) increased virulence and bacterial survival in vivo and reduced gallbladder interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. Colanic acid and curli mutants had the largest defects in biofilm-forming ability and contributed most significantly to the virulence increase of the \u0394wcaM \u0394csgA \u0394yihO \u0394bcsE mutant strain. While the \u0394wcaM \u0394csgA \u0394yihO \u0394bcsE mutant was not altered in resistance to complement or growth in macrophages, it attached and invaded macrophages better than the wild-type (WT) strain. These data suggest that ECM components have various levels of importance in biofilm formation and gallbladder colonization and that the ECM diminishes disseminated disease in our model, perhaps by reducing cell attachment/invasion and dampening inflammation by maintaining/inducing IL-10 production. Understanding how ECM components aid acute disease and persistence could lead to improvements in therapeutic treatment of typhoid fever patients.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253258": "The host-pathogen interactions occurring in the gallbladder during Salmonella Typhi colonization contribute to typhoid fever pathogenesis during the acute and chronic stages of disease. The gallbladder is the primary reservoir during chronic typhoid carriage. In this organ, Salmonella encounters host-barriers including bile, immunoglobulins, and mucus. However, the bacterium possesses mechanisms to resist and persist in this environment, in part by its ability to attach to and invade into the gallbladder epithelium. Such persistence in the gallbladder epithelium contributes to chronic carriage. In addition, patients harboring gallstones in their gallbladders have increased risk of becoming carriers because these abnormalities serve as a substrate for Salmonella biofilm formation. Our laboratory has studied the Salmonella interactions in this specific environment by developing in vitro methods that closely mimic the gallbladder and gallstones niches. These methods are reproducible and provide a platform for future studies of acute and chronic bacterial infections in the gallbladder.",

Because typhoid fever-causing Salmonella have no known environmental reservoir, the chronic, asymptomatic carrier state is thought to be a key feature of continued maintenance of the bacterium within human populations. Despite the importance of this disease to public health, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that catalyze carriage, as well as our ability to reliably identify and treat the Salmonella carrier state, have only recently begun to advance.",

Such carriers are thought to be reservoirs for further spread of the disease. Gallbladder carriage has been demonstrated to be mediated by biofilm formation on gallstones and by intracellular persistence in the gallbladder epithelium of mice. In addition, both gallstones and chronic carriage have been associated with chronic inflammation and the development of gallbladder carcinoma. However, the pathogenic relationship between typhoid carriage and the development of pre-malignant and/or malignant lesions in the hepatopancreatobiliary system as well as the host-pathogen interactions occurring during chronic carriage remains unclear. In this study, we monitored the histopathological features of chronic carriage up to 1 year post-infection. Chronic cholecystitis and hepatitis ranging from mild to severe were present in infected mice regardless of the presence of gallstones. Biliary epithelial hyperplasia was observed more commonly in the gallbladder of mice with gallstones (uninfected or infected). However, pre-malignant lesions, atypical hyperplasia and metaplasia of the gallbladder and exocrine pancreas, respectively, were only associated with chronic Salmonella carriage. This study has implications regarding the role of Salmonella chronic infection and inflammation in the development of pre-malignant lesions in the epithelium of the gallbladder and pancreas that could lead to oncogenesis.",

This chronic state is highly associated with the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder of infected carriers upon which Salmonella can form robust biofilms. However, we hypothesize that in addition to gallstones, the gallbladder epithelium aids in the establishment/maintenance of chronic carriage. In this work, we present evidence of the role of the gallbladder epithelium in chronic carriage by a mechanism involving invasion, intracellular persistence, and biofilm formation. Salmonella was able to adhere to and invade polarized gallbladder epithelial cells apically in the absence and presence of bile in a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-dependent manner. Intracellular replication of Salmonella was also evident at 12 and 24 h postinvasion. A flowthrough system revealed that Salmonella is able to adhere to and form extensive bacterial foci on gallbladder epithelial cells as early as 12 h postinoculation. In vivo experiments using a chronic mouse model of typhoid carriage showed invasion and damage of the gallbladder epithelium and lamina propria up to 2 months after Salmonella infection, with an abundant presence of macrophages, a relative absence of neutrophils, and extrusion of infected epithelial cells. Additionally, microcolonies of Salmonella cells were evident on the surface of the mouse gallbladder epithelia up to 21 days postinfection. These data reveal a second potential mechanism, intracellular persistence and/or bacterial aggregation in/on the gallbladder epithelium with luminal cell extrusion, for Salmonella maintenance in the gallbladder.",

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters of 2196 certainly diagnosed (1272 beta-thalassaemia minor and 924 iron deficiency) samples were used to evaluate the following indices and formulas: Bessman index (RDW), Mentzer formula (MCV/RBC), England and Fraser formula (MCV - RBC - 5 x Hb- 3.4), Shine and Lal formula (MCV2 x MCH/100), Ehsani formula (MCV-10 x RBC), Srivastava formula (MCH/RBC), Green and King formula (MCV2 x RDW/Hb x 100), red distribution width index RDWI (RDW x MCV/RBC), RDW/RBC, as well as our formula (MCV-RBC -3 x Hb). For each index and formula, the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), in addition, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated. No significant differences were reported between our formula, Green-King formula and the RDWI (P &gt; 0.05) in discriminating beta-thalassaemia minor from iron deficiency (AUC = 0.914, 0.909 and 0.907 respectively).

The firstline treatment is a combination therapy of oral nifurtimox and intravenous eflornithine that needs to be administered in a hospital setting by trained personnel, which is not optimal given that patients often live in remote areas with few health resources. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with late-stage g-HAT. In this randomised, phase 2/3, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we recruited patients aged 15 years and older with late-stage g-HAT from g-HAT treatment centres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=9) and the Central African Republic (n=1). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either fexinidazole or nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy according to a predefined randomisation list (block size six). The funder, data management personnel, and study statisticians were masked to treatment. Oral fexinidazole was given once a day (days 1-4: 1800 mg, days 5-10: 1200 mg). Oral nifurtimox was given three times a day (days 1-10: 15 mg/kg per day) with eflornithine twice a day as 2 h infusions (days 1-7: 400 mg/kg per day). The primary endpoint was success at 18 months (ie, deemed as patients being alive, having no evidence of trypanosomes in any body fluid, not requiring rescue medication, and having a cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count \u226420 cells per \u03bcL). Safety was assessed through routine monitoring. Primary efficacy analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat population and safety analyses in the intention-to-treat population. The acceptable margin for the difference in success rates was defined as 13%. This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01685827\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01685827</a>.

Of the 409 eligible patients, 14 were not included because they did not meet all inclusion criteria (n=12) or for another reason (n=2). Therefore, 394 patients were randomly assigned, 264 to receive fexinidazole and 130 to receive nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy. Success at 18 months was recorded in 239 (91%) patients given fexinidazole and 124 (98%) patients given nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy, within the margin of acceptable difference of -6\u00b74% (97\u00b706% CI -11\u00b72 to -1\u00b76; p=0\u00b70029). We noted no difference in the proportion of patients who experienced treatment-related adverse events (215 [81%] in the fexinidazole group vs 102 [79%] in the nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy group). Treatment discontinuations were unrelated to treatment (n=2 [1%] in the fexinidazole group). Temporary nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy interruption occurred in three (2%) patients. 11 patients died during the study (nine [3%] in the fexinidazole group vs two [2%] in the nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy group).

Chagas disease is characterised by an acute phase, which is partially resolved by the immune system, but then develops as a chronic life-long infection. There is a consensus that the front-line drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox are more effective against the acute stage in both clinical and experimental settings. However, confirmative studies have been restricted by difficulties in demonstrating sterile parasitological cure. Here, we describe a systematic study of nitroheterocyclic drug efficacy using highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging of murine infections. Unexpectedly, we find both drugs are more effective at curing chronic infections, judged by treatment duration and therapeutic dose. This was not associated with factors that differentially influence plasma drug concentrations in the two disease stages. We also observed that fexinidazole and fexinidazole sulfone are more effective than benznidazole and nifurtimox as curative treatments, particularly for acute stage infections, most likely as a result of the higher and more prolonged exposure of the sulfone derivative.

Core components of all scenarios include detecting and treating cases with established or emerging techniques. Relatively more intensive scenarios incorporate vector control. New tools considered include tiny targets for tsetse fly control, use of rapid diagnostic tests and oral treatment with fexinidazole or oxaboroles. Scenarios consider the time when critical new tools are expected to become ready for deployment by national control programmes. Based on a review of the latest epidemiological data, we estimate the various interventions to cover 1,380,600 km(2) and 56,986,000 people.

Female Swiss mice infected with the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi were treated orally once per day with each metabolite at doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg of body weight for a period of 20 days. Parasitemia was monitored throughout, and cures were detected by parasitological and PCR assays. The results were compared with those achieved with benznidazole treatment at the same doses. Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in reducing the numbers of circulating parasites and protecting mice against death, compared with untreated mice, but without providing cures at daily doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg. Both metabolites were effective in curing mice at 50 mg/kg/day (30% to 40%) and 100 mg/kg/day (100%). In the benznidazole-treated group, parasitological cure was detected only in animals treated with the higher dose of 100 mg/kg/day (80%). Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for each metabolite were obtained from a parallel group of uninfected mice and were used to estimate the profiles following repeated doses. Pharmacokinetic data suggested that biological efficacy most likely resides with the sulfone metabolite (or subsequent reactive metabolites formed following reduction of the nitro group) following administration of either the sulfoxide or the sulfone and that prolonged plasma exposure over the 24-h dosing window is required to achieve high cure rates. Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in treating T. cruzi in a mouse model of acute infection, with cure rates superior to those achieved with either fexinidazole itself or benznidazole.",

Fexinidazole, a 2-subsituted 5-nitroimidazole drug candidate rediscovered following extensive compound mining by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and currently in Phase I clinical study for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis, was evaluated in experimental models of acute and chronic CD caused by different strains of Trypanosoma cruzi. We investigated the in vivo activity of fexinidazole against T. cruzi, using mice as hosts. The T. cruzi strains used in the study were previously characterized in murine models as susceptible (CL strain), partially resistant (Y strain), and resistant (Colombian and VL-10 strains) to the drugs currently in clinical use, benznidazole and nifurtimox. Our results demonstrated that fexinidazole was effective in suppressing parasitemia and preventing death in infected animals for all strains tested. In addition, assessment of definitive parasite clearance (cure) through parasitological, PCR, and serological methods showed cure rates of 80.0% against CL and Y strains, 88.9% against VL-10 strain, and 77.8% against Colombian strain among animals treated during acute phase, and 70% (VL-10 strain) in those treated in chronic phase. Benznidazole had a similar effect against susceptible and partially resistant T. cruzi strains. Fexinidazole treatment was also shown to reduce myocarditis in all animals infected with VL-10 or Colombian resistant T. cruzi strains, although parasite eradication was not achieved in all treated animals at the tested doses.

Current treatment options for HAT are scarce, toxic, no longer effective, or very difficult to administer, in particular for the advanced, fatal stage of the disease (stage 2, chronic HAT). New safe, effective and easy-to-use treatments are urgently needed. Here it is shown that fexinidazole, a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole rediscovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) after extensive compound mining efforts of more than 700 new and existing nitroheterocycles, could be a short-course, safe and effective oral treatment curing both acute and chronic HAT and that could be implemented at the primary health care level. To complete the preclinical development and meet the regulatory requirements before initiating human trials, the anti-parasitic properties and the pharmacokinetic, metabolic and toxicological profile of fexinidazole have been assessed. Standard in vitro and in vivo anti-parasitic activity assays were conducted to assess drug efficacy in experimental models for HAT. In parallel, a full range of preclinical pharmacology and safety studies, as required by international regulatory guidelines before initiating human studies, have been conducted. Fexinidazole is moderately active in vitro against African trypanosomes (IC\u2085\u2080 against laboratory strains and recent clinical isolates ranged between 0.16 and 0.93 \u00b5g/mL) and oral administration of fexinidazole at doses of 100 mg/kg/day for 4 days or 200 mg/kg/day for 5 days cured mice with acute and chronic infection respectively, the latter being a model for the advanced and fatal stage of the disease when parasites have disseminated into the brain. In laboratory animals, fexinidazole is well absorbed after oral administration and readily distributes throughout the body, including the brain. The absolute bioavailability of oral fexinidazole was 41% in mice, 30% in rats, and 10% in dogs. Furthermore, fexinidazole is rapidly metabolised in vivo to at least two biologically active metabolites (a sulfoxide and a sulfone derivative) that likely account for a significant portion of the therapeutic effect. Key pharmacokinetic parameter after oral absorption in mice for fexinidazole and its sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites are a C(max) of 500, 14171 and 13651 ng/mL respectively, and an AUC\u2080\u208b\u2082\u2084 of 424, 45031 and 96286 h.ng/mL respectively. Essentially similar PK profiles were observed in rats and dogs. Toxicology studies (including safety pharmacology and 4-weeks repeated-dose toxicokinetics in rat and dog) have shown that fexinidazole is well tolerated. The No Observed Adverse Event Levels in the 4-weeks repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs was 200 mg/kg/day in both species, with no issues of concern identified for doses up to 800 mg/kg/day. While fexinidazole, like many nitroheterocycles, is mutagenic in the Ames test due to bacterial specific metabolism, it is not genotoxic to mammalian cells in vitro or in vivo as assessed in an in vitro micronucleus test on human lymphocytes, an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test, and an ex vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rats. The results of the preclinical pharmacological and safety studies indicate that fexinidazole is a safe and effective oral drug candidate with no untoward effects that would preclude evaluation in man.

The present studies aimed to determine the best dose regimen for the treatment of stage 2 sleeping sickness patients, which could eventually also treat stage 1 patients. Fexinidazole was assessed in 154 healthy adult male subjects of sub-Saharan African origin. Three initial first-in-human studies and two additional studies assessed a single ascending dose and multiple ascending doses (both under fasted conditions), tablet versus suspension formulation and food effect (fasted vs. high-fat meal and field-adapted food), and multiple ascending doses with a loading dose regimen under fed conditions. Fexinidazole was well-tolerated in a single dose from 100 to 3,600 mg, with quick absorption of the parent drug and rapid metabolism into sulfoxide [time to maximum concentration (t max) 2-5 h] and sulfone (t max 18-24 h). The tablet formulation was approximately 25 % less bioavailable than the suspension, and food intake increased drug absorption and plasma concentrations of fexinidazole and its two metabolites by approximately 200 %. Fourteen-day multiple ascending dosing administered up to 3,600 mg/day in fasted conditions showed that fexinidazole was generally well-tolerated (mild to moderate, spontaneously reversible drug-related adverse events). Following the high-fat food effect finding, another study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a low-fat regimen closer to that of the target population, showing that the type of meal does not influence fexinidazole absorption. The last study showed that a loading dose of 1,800 mg/day for 4 days followed by a 1,200 mg/day regimen for 6 days with a normal meal provided the desired exposure of fexinidazole and its metabolites, particularly sulfone, with good tolerability. Based on preclinical evidence from a chronic infection mouse model, systemic drug concentrations obtained are expected to be clinically effective in stage 2 HAT. These studies show that fexinidazole can be safely assessed in patients as a potential oral cure for both stages of HAT.",

Here, we report that fexinidazole, a drug currently in phase 1 clinical trials for treating African trypanosomiasis, shows promise for treating visceral leishmaniasis. This 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole drug is rapidly oxidized in vivo in mice, dogs, and humans to sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites. Both metabolites of fexinidazole were active against Leishmania donovani amastigotes grown in macrophages, whereas the parent compound was inactive. Pharmacokinetic studies with fexinidazole (200 mg/kg) showed that fexinidazole sulfone achieves blood concentrations in mice above the EC(99) (effective concentration inhibiting growth by 99%) value for at least 24 hours after a single oral dose. A once-daily regimen for 5 days at this dose resulted in a 98.4% suppression of infection in a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis, equivalent to that seen with the drugs miltefosine and Pentostam, which are currently used clinically to treat this tropical disease. In African trypanosomes, the mode of action of nitro drugs involves reductive activation via a NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent bacterial-like nitroreductase. Overexpression of the leishmanial homolog of this nitroreductase in L. donovani increased sensitivity to fexinidazole by 19-fold, indicating that a similar mechanism is involved in both parasites. These findings illustrate the potential of fexinidazole as an oral drug therapy for treating visceral leishmaniasis.",

The compound and its two principal metabolites, sulfoxide and sulfone, have been assessed for their ability to kill a range of T. brucei parasite strains in vitro and to cure both acute and chronic HAT disease models in the mouse. The parent molecule and both metabolites have shown trypanocidal activity in vitro in the 0.7-to-3.3 \u03bcM (0.2-to-0.9 \u03bcg/ml) range against all parasite strains tested. In vivo, fexinidazole is orally effective in curing both acute and chronic diseases in the mouse at doses of 100 mg/kg of body weight/day for 4 days and 200 mg/kg/day for 5 days, respectively. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that it is likely that the sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites provide most, if not all, of the in vivo killing activity. Fexinidazole and its metabolites require up to 48 h exposure in order to induce maximal trypanocidal efficacy in vitro. The parent drug and its metabolites show no in vitro cross-reactivity in terms of trypanocidal activity with either themselves or other known trypanocidal drugs in use in humans. The in vitro and in vivo antitrypanosomal activities of fexinidazole and its two principal metabolites provide evidence that the compound has the potential to be an effective oral treatment for both the T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense forms of human sleeping sickness and both stages of the disease.",

New, safe, effective and easy-to-use treatments are urgently needed. Many nitroimidazoles possess antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity and examples such as tinidazole are used to treat trichomoniasis and guardiasis, but concerns about toxicity including genotoxicity limit their usefulness. Fexinidazole, a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole rediscovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) after extensive compound mining of public and pharmaceutical company databases, has the potential to become a short-course, safe and effective oral treatment, curing both acute and chronic HAT. This paper describes the genotoxicity profile of fexinidazole and its two active metabolites, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives. All the three compounds are mutagenic in the Salmonella/Ames test; however, mutagenicity is either attenuated or lost in Ames Salmonella strains that lack one or more nitroreductase(s). It is known that these enzymes can nitroreduce compounds with low redox potentials, whereas their mammalian cell counterparts cannot, under normal conditions. Fexinidazole and its metabolites have low redox potentials and all mammalian cell assays to detect genetic toxicity, conducted for this study either in vitro (micronucleus test in human lymphocytes) or in vivo (ex vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats; bone marrow micronucleus test in mice), were negative. Thus, fexinidazole does not pose a genotoxic hazard to patients and represents a promising drug candidate for HAT. Fexinidazole is expected to enter Phase II clinical trials in 2012.",

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are imperative in order to prevent vision loss and progression of the disease. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are inflammatory markers which are elevated in the majority of patients and support the diagnosis of GCA among patients who present with typical symptoms. GCA is confirmed with superficial temporal artery biopsy which demonstrates characteristic pathological findings. Treatment of suspected ophthalmic involvement must be initiated urgently, even when diagnostic studies are pending. High dose corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of treatment and is administered either intravenously or orally to prevent further vision loss and treat systemic vasculitis. Oral corticosteroid therapy is required for months to years with careful follow-up and periodic laboratory evaluations with ESR and CRP. Corticosteroids are tapered gradually over months and may be associated with complications such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, psychosis, peptic ulcer disease, and infection. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate therapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and initiation of a proton pump inhibitor or Histamine H2-receptor antagonist should be considered. Recurrence of inflammation is common in GCA and necessitates an escalation of corticosteroid dose. Adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy may be considered in patients experiencing relapsing inflammation despite high doses of corticosteroids or those with corticosteroid-induced complications. Emerging evidence for adjunctive therapy with tocilizumab, methotrexate, aspirin, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins is encouraging and may lead to a more mainstream role for these therapies among patients with GCA.",

Areas covered: In this article, we will review the standard and biological treatment strategies in large vessel vasculitis, and we will focus on the current approaches to these diseases. Expert commentary: The results of treatment trials with conventional immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide have overall been disappointing. TNF-\u03b1 blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis. Observational evidence strongly supports the use of anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents and tocilizumab in Takayasu patients with relapsing disease. However biological agents are not curative, and relapses remain common.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27927642": " Randomised-controlled trials have recently proven the efficacy of the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab (TCZ) in giant cell arteritis (GCA). However, the mechanism of action of IL-6 blockade in this disease is unknown. Moreover, the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the pathogenesis of GCA remains underexplored. Given the plasticity of Tregs and the importance of IL-6 in their biology, we hypothesised that TCZ might modulate the Treg response in GCA. We therefore characterised the Treg compartment of patients with GCA treated with TCZ. We classified 41 patients with GCA into three groups: active disease (aGCA, n=11), disease remission on corticosteroids (rGCA-CS, n=19) and disease remission on TCZ (rGCA-TCZ, n=11). Healthy controls (HCs) were included for comparison. We determined the frequency, phenotype and function of peripheral blood Tregs. Patients with aGCA demonstrated a hypoproliferating Treg compartment enriched in IL-17-secreting Tregs (IL-17<sup>+</sup>Tregs). Tregs in patients with aGCA disproportionally expressed a hypofunctional isoform of Foxp3 that lacks exon 2 (Foxp3\u03942). Foxp3\u03942-expressing Tregs coexpressed CD161, a marker commonly associated with the Th17 linage, significantly more often than full-length Foxp3-expressing Tregs. Compared with those of HCs, GCA-derived Tregs demonstrated impaired suppressor capacity. Treatment with TCZ, in contrast to CS therapy, corrected the Treg abnormalities observed in aGCA. In addition, TCZ treatment increased the numbers of activated Tregs (CD45RA<sup>-</sup>Foxp3<sup>high</sup>) and the Treg expression of markers of trafficking (CCR4) and terminal differentiation (CTLA-4). TCZ may exert its therapeutic effects in GCA by increasing the proliferation and activation of Tregs, and by reverting the pathogenic Treg phenotype seen during active disease.",

Despite the frequency of this disease, there is currently no international consensus on its therapeutic modalities. The aim of this study was to conduct a review on an international literature about the treatment of GCA, whatever the clinical pattern might be. Oral corticosteroids remain the cornerstone treatment, possibly preceded by intravenous bolus in complicated forms. In cases of glucocorticoid (GC) dependence or GC-related side effects, a GC-sparing agent may be necessary. Methotrexate is one of the most used treatments despite its low level of evidence and mild efficacy. Cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab look promising but require validation in further studies. The results for TNF-\u03b1 blockers and azathioprine are disappointing. Preventing complications of prolonged corticosteroid therapy is a world challenge and the management of GC-induced osteoporosis is not the same from one country to another. There is a significant risk of arterial thrombosis, mainly at treatment onset, which may encourage to associate an antiplatelet therapy, especially in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Place of statins in the treatment of the disease is uncertain.",

Permanent visual loss related to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is among the most serious complications of this disease and initial treatment usually consists of high dose corticosteroids. There is no consensus in the literature concerning the optimal therapeutic approach in giant cell arteritis patients with corticosteroid-resistant arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. A 73-year-old Caucasian female with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis developed an acute visual loss of the right eye due to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Despite 5 daily methylprednisolone pulses, systemic symptoms persisted and rapid involvement of the controlateral eye was documented. Therefore, tocilizumab (humanised monoclonal antibody binding the human interleukin-6 receptor) was introduced as a potential salvage therapy with a swift consecutive resolution of the systemic symptoms and stabilization of the ophthalmic lesions. Although a late effect of steroids pulses cannot be formally ruled out in this dramatic situation, tocilizumab likely offered a decisive effect in preventing bilateral blindness and may have contributed to steroid tapering. Tocilizumab may represent a new early effective second-line treatment option in corticosteroid-resistant anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. More data are needed to confirm this observation and to evaluate the safety profile of this treatment.",

The effect of the interleukin-6 receptor alpha inhibitor tocilizumab on the rates of relapse during glucocorticoid tapering was studied in patients with giant-cell arteritis. In this 1-year trial, we randomly assigned 251 patients, in a 2:1:1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (at a dose of 162 mg) weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of sustained glucocorticoid-free remission at week 52 in each tocilizumab group as compared with the rate in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper. The key secondary outcome was the rate of remission in each tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper. Dosing of prednisone and safety were also assessed. Sustained remission at week 52 occurred in 56% of the patients treated with tocilizumab weekly and in 53% of those treated with tocilizumab every other week, as compared with 14% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper and 18% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper (P&lt;0.001 for the comparisons of either active treatment with placebo). The cumulative median prednisone dose over the 52-week period was 1862 mg in each tocilizumab group, as compared with 3296 mg in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week taper (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons) and 3818 mg in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week taper (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Serious adverse events occurred in 15% of the patients in the group that received tocilizumab weekly, 14% of those in the group that received tocilizumab every other week, 22% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week taper, and 25% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week taper. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy developed in one patient in the group that received tocilizumab every other week. Tocilizumab, received weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was superior to either 26-week or 52-week prednisone tapering plus placebo with regard to sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with giant-cell arteritis.

The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria currently used to define giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis were designed to discriminate between different types of vasculitides but not to differentiate vasculitis from other disorders. Recently, efforts have been made to overcome the shortcomings of the ACR criteria. The lack of an accepted definition of disease activity in large-vessel vasculitides presents a major challenge in creating useful and valid outcome tools for the assessment of disease course. Identification of predictors of flares can aid in optimizing therapeutic strategies, minimizing disease flares, and reducing treatment-related side effects. It is furthermore important to recognize and characterize the risk factor that might predict the manifestations associated with poor outcome and prognosis. Two RCTs have evidenced the efficacy of tocilizumab in addition to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA). However, the role of tocilizumab or other biological agents without GCs needs to be investigated. Recent observational studies have suggested that rituximab is also effective in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-negative patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. Rituximab or anti-TNF alfa may represent a possible alternative therapy in case of refractory or difficult to treat polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) patients. The new International Criteria for Beh\u00e7et's Disease have shown a better sensitivity and a better accuracy compared to the older International Study Group on Beh\u00e7et's Disease criteria.

The treatment of GCA and TAK essentially relies on glucocorticoids. However, thanks to major progress in our understanding of their pathogenesis, the role of biological therapies in the treatment of these two vasculitides is expanding, especially in relapsing or refractory diseases. In this review, the efficacy, the safety and the limits of the main biological therapies ever tested in GCA and TAK are discussed. Briefly, anti TNF-\u03b1 agents appear to be effective in treating TAK but not GCA. Recent randomized placebo-controlled trials have reported on the efficacy and safety of abatacept and mostly tocilizumab in inducing and maintaining remission of GCA. Abatacept was not effective in TAK and robust data are still lacking to draw any conclusions concerning the use of tocilizumab in TAK. Furthermore, ustekinumab appears promising in relapsing/refractory GCA whereas rituximab has been reported to be effective in only a few cases of refractory TAK patients. If a biological therapy is indicated, and in light of the data discussed in this review, the first choice would be tocilizumab in GCA and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents (mainly infliximab) in TAK.",

Despite the therapy with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, the aortitis was not ameliorated. However, after cyclophosphamide was replaced with intravenous tocilizumab, the aortitis was improved, and the prednisolone dose was successfully tapered to 4 mg/day without elevation in C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase ANCA (MPO-ANCA) levels. Several studies have reported that tocilizumab is effective for aortitis associated with Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arteritis.

Nuclear organization has emerged as a key parameter in the formation of chromosomal translocations, yet little is known as to whether DNA repair can efficiently occur throughout the nucleus and whether it is affected by the location of the lesion. Here, we induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at different nuclear compartments and follow their fate. We demonstrate that DSBs induced at the nuclear membrane (but not at nuclear pores or nuclear interior) fail to rapidly activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair by homologous recombination (HR). Real-time and superresolution imaging reveal that DNA DSBs within lamina-associated domains do not migrate to more permissive environments for HR, like the nuclear pores or the nuclear interior, but instead are repaired in situ by alternative end-joining. Our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of DNA repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in DSB repair controlled by spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus.",

Point mutations within FBXO7 map within specific functional domains, including near its F-box domain and its substrate recruiting domains, suggesting that deficiencies in SCF<sup>Fbxo7/PARK15</sup> ubiquitin ligase activity are mechanistically linked to early-onset PD. To date, relatively few substrates of the ligase have been identified. These include HURP (hepatoma up-regulated protein), whose ubiquitination results in proteasome-mediated degradation, and c-IAP1 (inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and NRAGE, which are not destabilized as a result of ubiquitination. None of these substrates have been linked directly to PD, nor has it been determined whether they would directly engage neuronal cell death pathways. To discover ubiquitinated substrates of SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup> implicated more directly in PD aetiology, we conducted a high-throughput screen using protein arrays to identify new candidates. A total of 338 new targets were identified and from these we validated glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (Gsk3\u03b2), which can phosphorylate \u03b1-synuclein, and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (Tomm20), a mitochondrial translocase that, when ubiquitinated, promotes mitophagy, as SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup> substrates both in vitro and in vivo Ubiquitin chain restriction analyses revealed that Fbxo7 modified Gsk3\u03b2 using K63 linkages. Our results indicate that Fbxo7 negatively regulates Gsk3\u03b2 activity, rather than its levels or localization. In addition, Fbxo7 ubiquitinated Tomm20, and its levels correlated with Fbxo7 expression, indicating a stabilizing effect. None of the PD-associated mutations in Fbxo7 impaired Tomm20 ubiquitination.

It is unknown whether these distinct protein assemblies are transported within and between neurons by similar or distinct mechanisms. It is also unclear if neuronal death or injury is required for neuron-to-neuron transfer. To address these questions, we used mouse primary cortical neurons grown in microfluidic devices to measure the amounts of \u03b1-synuclein, A\u03b242 and HTTExon1 fibrils transported by axons in both directions (anterograde and retrograde), as well as to examine the mechanism of their release from axons after anterograde transport. We observed that the three fibrils were transported in both anterograde and retrograde directions but with strikingly different efficiencies. The amount of A\u03b242 fibrils transported was ten times higher than that of the other two fibrils. HTTExon1 was efficiently transported in the retrograde direction but only marginally in the anterograde direction. Finally, using neurons from two distinct mutant mouse strains whose axons are highly resistant to neurodegeneration (Wld(S) and Sarm1(-/-)), we found that the three different fibrils were secreted by axons after anterograde transport, in the absence of axonal lysis, indicating that trans-neuronal spread can occur in intact healthy neurons. In summary, fibrils of \u03b1-synuclein, A\u03b242 and HTTExon1 are all transported in axons but in directions and amounts that are specific of each fibril. After anterograde transport, the three fibrils were secreted in the medium in the absence of axon lysis. Continuous secretion could play an important role in the spread of pathology between neurons but may be amenable to pharmacological intervention.",

Conclusion: We seek to provide context as to why a broad indication was given for NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients (HCV genotypes 1-6) while the indication for NS5A inhibitor- na\u00efve patients was limited to HCV genotypes 1a and 3 only.

However, the physiological roles of extra-SCN circadian clocks in the brain remain largely elusive. In response, we generated <i>Nkx2.1-Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice in which <i>Bmal1</i>, an essential clock component, was genetically deleted specifically in the ventral forebrain, including the preoptic area, nucleus of the diagonal band, and most of the hypothalamus except the SCN. In these mice, as expected, PER2::LUC oscillation was drastically attenuated in the explants of mediobasal hypothalamus, whereas it was maintained in those of the SCN. Although, <i>Nkx2.1-Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice were rhythmic and nocturnal, they showed altered patterns of locomotor activity during the night in a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and during subjective night in constant darkness. Control mice were more active during the first half than the second half of the dark phase or subjective night, whereas <i>Nkx2.1-Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed the opposite pattern of locomotor activity. Temporal patterns of sleep-wakefulness and feeding also changed accordingly. Such results suggest that along with mechanisms in the SCN, local <i>Bmal1</i>-dependent clocks in the ventral forebrain are critical for generating precise temporal patterns of circadian behaviors.",

Notwithstanding, the main role of the SCN clock on the control of all circadian rhythms has been questioned due to the presence of clock activity in many brain areas, including those implicated in the regulation of feeding and reward. Moreover, whether circadian rhythms of particular motivated behaviors exist is unknown. Here, we evaluated the spontaneous daily and circadian behavior of consumption of a sweet caloric solution (5-10% sucrose), and the effects of sucrose intake on the expression of clock genes in the mouse brain. Mice showed a daily (in a light-dark cycle) and a circadian (in constant darkness conditions) rhythm in the intake and sucrose preference with a rise for both parameters at night (or subjective night). In addition, we observed changes in the circadian day-night expression of the clock gene Per2 in the SCN, cortex and striatum of animals ingesting sucrose compared to control mice on pure water. Finally, daily rhythms of sucrose intake and preference were abolished in Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup>- and double Per1<sup>-/-</sup>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup>-mutant animals. These data indicate that the expression of circadian rhythms of hedonic feeding behaviors may be controlled by brain circadian clocks and Per gene expression.",

Its circadian (\u223c24 hr) oscillations of gene expression and electrical activity are generated intrinsically and can persist indefinitely in temporal isolation. This robust and resilient timekeeping is generally regarded as a product of the intrinsic connectivity of its neurons. Here we show that neurons constitute only one \"half\" of the SCN clock, the one metabolically active during circadian daytime. In contrast, SCN astrocytes are active during circadian nighttime, when they suppress the activity of SCN neurons by regulating extracellular glutamate levels. This glutamatergic gliotransmission is sensed by neurons of the dorsal SCN via specific pre-synaptic NMDA receptor assemblies containing NR2C subunits. Remarkably, somatic genetic re-programming of intracellular clocks in SCN astrocytes was capable of remodeling circadian behavioral rhythms in adult mice. Thus, SCN circuit-level timekeeping arises from interdependent and mutually supportive astrocytic-neuronal signaling.",

However, neurons of the cerebellar cortex also contain a circadian oscillator with circadian expression of clock genes being controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. It has been suggested that the cerebellar circadian oscillator is involved in food anticipation, but direct molecular evidence of the role of the circadian oscillator of the cerebellar cortex is currently unavailable. To investigate the hypothesis that the circadian oscillator of the cerebellum is involved in circadian physiology and food anticipation, we therefore by use of Cre-LoxP technology generated a conditional knockout mouse with the core clock gene Arntl deleted specifically in granule cells of the cerebellum, since expression of clock genes in the cerebellar cortex is mainly located in this cell type. We here report that deletion of Arntl heavily influences the molecular clock of the cerebellar cortex with significantly altered and arrhythmic expression of other central clock and clock-controlled genes. On the other hand, daily expression of clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus was unaffected. Telemetric registrations in different light regimes did not detect significant differences in circadian rhythms of running activity and body temperature between Arntl conditional knockout mice and controls. Furthermore, food anticipatory behavior did not differ between genotypes. These data suggest that Arntl is an essential part of the cerebellar oscillator; however, the oscillator of the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex does not control traditional circadian parameters or food anticipation.",

Nocturnal symptoms in asthma are common and are an important indicator for escalation of treatment. An extensive body of research has demonstrated that nocturnal symptoms of cough and dyspnea are accompanied by circadian variations in airway inflammation and physiologic variables, including airflow limitation and airways hyper-responsiveness. The molecular apparatus that underpins circadian variations, controlled by so called 'clock' genes, has recently been characterised. Clock genes control circadian rhythms both centrally, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain and peripherally, within every organ of the body.

Although circadian clocks control the rhythmic expression of a large number of genes involved in metabolism and other aspects of circadian physiology, the consequences of genetic disruption of circadian-controlled pathways remain poorly defined. Here we report that the targeted disruption of Nocturnin (Ccrn4l) in mice, a gene that encodes a circadian deadenylase, confers resistance to diet-induced obesity. Mice lacking Nocturnin remain lean on high-fat diets, with lower body weight and reduced visceral fat. However, unlike lean lipodystrophic mouse models, these mice do not have fatty livers and do not exhibit increased activity or reduced food intake. Gene expression data suggest that Nocturnin knockout mice have deficits in lipid metabolism or uptake, in addition to changes in glucose and insulin sensitivity. Our data support a pivotal role for Nocturnin downstream of the circadian clockwork in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes necessary for nutrient uptake, metabolism, and storage.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25512305": "Circadian rhythms are the approximate 24-h biological cycles that function to prepare an organism for daily environmental changes. They are driven by the molecular clock, a transcriptional:translational feedback mechanism that in mammals involves the core clock genes Bmal1, Clock, Per1/2, and Cry1/2. The molecular clock is present in virtually all cells of an organism. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been well studied, but the clocks in the peripheral tissues, such as heart and skeletal muscle, have just begun to be investigated. Skeletal muscle is one of the largest organs in the body, comprising approximately 45% of total body mass. More than 2300 genes in skeletal muscle are expressed in a circadian pattern, and these genes participate in a wide range of functions, including myogenesis, transcription, and metabolism. The circadian rhythms of skeletal muscle can be entrained both indirectly through light input to the SCN and directly through time of feeding and activity. It is critical for the skeletal muscle molecular clock not only to be entrained to the environment but also to be in synchrony with rhythms of other tissues. When circadian rhythms are disrupted, the observed effects on skeletal muscle include fiber-type shifts, altered sarcomeric structure, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and impaired muscle function. Furthermore, there are detrimental effects on metabolic health, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, which skeletal muscle likely contributes to considering it is a key metabolic tissue. These data indicate a critical role for skeletal muscle circadian rhythms for both muscle and systems health. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms of molecular clock function in skeletal muscle, identify the means by which skeletal muscle entrainment occurs, and provide a stringent comparison of circadian gene expression across the diverse tissue system of skeletal muscle.",

In mammals, a master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, adjusts timing of other self-sustained oscillators in the brain and peripheral organs. Synchronisation to external cues is mainly achieved by ambient light, which resets the SCN clock. Other environmental factors, in particular food availability and time of feeding, also influence internal timing. Timed feeding can reset the phase of the peripheral oscillators whilst having almost no effect in shifting the phase of the SCN clockwork when animals are exposed (synchronised) to a light-dark cycle. Food deprivation and calorie restriction lead not only to loss of body mass (&gt;15%) and increased motor activity, but also affect the timing of daily activity, nocturnal animals becoming partially diurnal (i.e. they are active during their usual sleep period). This change in behavioural timing is due in part to the fact that metabolic cues associated with calorie restriction affect the SCN clock and its synchronisation to light.",

In the present study, we investigated the physiological function of the molecular clock on bone remodeling. The results of loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments both indicated that the rhythmic expression of Tnfrsf11b, which encodes osteoprotegerin (OPG), was regulated by Bmal1 in MC3T3-E1 cells. We also showed that REV-ERB\u03b1 negatively regulated Tnfrsf11b as well as Bmal1 in MC3T3-E1 cells. We systematically investigated the relationship between the sympathetic nervous system and the circadian clock in osteoblasts. The administration of phenylephrine, a nonspecific \u03b11-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist, stimulated the expression of Tnfrsf11b, whereas the genetic ablation of \u03b11B-AR signaling led to the alteration of Tnfrsf11b expression concomitant with Bmal1 and Per2 in bone. Thus, this study demonstrated that the circadian regulation of Tnfrsf11b was regulated by the clock genes encoding REV-ERB\u03b1 (Nr1d1) and Bmal1 (Bmal1, also known as Arntl), which are components of the core loop of the circadian clock in osteoblasts.",

Our results demonstrate that the SCN circadian clock, when isolated in vitro, can be phase advanced by leptin in a dose-dependent fashion that does not require non-SCN hypothalamic tissue.

The present study examined the effects of disrupted LD cycles on peripheral clocks in mice housed under a normal 12 h light-12 h dark cycle (LD 12:12) or an ultradian LD 3:3 cycle. Drinking behavior seemed to be free-running with a long period (26.03 h) under ultradian LD 3:3 cycles, in addition to light-induced direct suppression (masking effect). Core body temperature completely lost robust circadian rhythm and acquired a 6-h rhythm with a low amplitude under LD 3:3. Robust circadian expression of Per1, Per2, Clock and Bmal1 mRNAs was similarly flattened to intermediate levels in the liver, heart and white adipose tissue under LD 3:3. Robust circadian expression of Rev-erb\u03b1 mRNA was completely damped in these tissues. Circadian expression of Dbp, a clock-controlled gene, was also disrupted in these tissues from mice housed under LD 3:3. The aberrant LD cycle seemed to induce the loss of circadian gene expression at the level of transcription, because rhythmic pre-mRNA expression of these genes was also abolished under LD 3:3. In addition to the direct effect of the aberrant LD cycle, abolished systemic time cues such as those of plasma corticosterone and body temperature might be involved in the disrupted expression of these circadian genes under LD 3:3. Our findings suggest that disrupted environmental LD cycles abolish the normal oscillation of peripheral clocks and induce internal desynchrony in mammals.",

In this chapter, we first consider the detailed mechanism of peripheral clocks as compared to clocks in the SCN and how mechanistic differences facilitate their functions.

The latter include signals depending on feeding cycles, glucocorticoid hormones, rhythmic blood-borne signals eliciting daily changes in actin dynamics and serum response factor (SRF) activity, and sensors of body temperature rhythms, such as heat shock transcription factors and the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRP. To study these systemic signalling pathways, we designed and engineered a novel, highly photosensitive apparatus, dubbed RT-Biolumicorder. This device enables us to record circadian luciferase reporter gene expression in the liver and other organs of freely moving mice over months in real time. Owing to the multitude of systemic signalling pathway involved in the phase resetting of peripheral clocks the disruption of any particular one has only minor effects on the steady state phase of circadian gene expression in organs such as the liver. Nonetheless, the implication of specific pathways in the synchronization of clock gene expression can readily be assessed by monitoring the phase-shifting kinetics using the RT-Biolumicorder.",

As such, central clock dysfunction can alter systemic homeostasis to consequently impair peripheral physiology in a manner that is secondary to circadian malfunction. To determine the impact of circadian clock function in organ transplantation and dissect the influence of intrinsic tissue clocks versus extrinsic clocks, we implemented a blood vessel grafting approach to surgically assemble a chimeric mouse that was part wild-type (WT) and part circadian clock mutant. Arterial isografts from donor WT mice that had been anastamosed to common carotid arteries of recipient WT mice (WT:WT) exhibited no pathology in this syngeneic transplant strategy. Similarly, when WT grafts were anastamosed to mice with disrupted circadian clocks, the structural features of the WT grafts immersed in the milieu of circadian malfunction were normal and absent of lesions, comparable to WT:WT grafts. In contrast, aortic grafts from Bmal1 knockout (KO) or Period-2,3 double-KO mice transplanted into littermate control WT mice developed robust arteriosclerotic disease. These lesions observed in donor grafts of Bmal1-KO were associated with up-regulation in T-cell receptors, macrophages, and infiltrating cells in the vascular grafts, but were independent of hemodynamics and B and T cell-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate the significance of intrinsic tissue clocks as an autonomous influence in experimental models of arteriosclerotic disease, which may have implications with regard to the influence of circadian clock function in organ transplantation.",

Various physiological functions such as sleep, arousal, blood pressure, body temperature, and hormone secretion are regulated in a 24-hour rhythm by this circuit. Somatic cells of other organs have a peripheral clock gene and by synchronizing the rhythm of the central and peripheral clocks, it is possible to live a healthy life. Due to aging and degenerative disease, circadian rhythm gradually collapses. Factors that can contribute to this include reduced expression of the time gene associated with photo stimulation, a reduction in neurotransmitter levels, and reduced melatonin production. Biological clocks play an important role in our emotions, cognitive function, and behavior. Sleep disorders and metabolic disease related to the circadian rhythm affect metabolic and endocrine activities via the autonomic nervous system and the intestinal bacterial flora. Shift work disorder is associated with insomnia and excessive drowsiness as individuals often work during their sleeping hours. Now time management is placed at the center of our society, and it is important to evaluate the medical risk of engaging in shift work. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the stereotypical behaviors may be associated with time. In some patients, multiple timed behaviors occupy a considerable part of the patient's daily life.

In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed).

Rise in prenatal opioid abuse has resulted in subsequent escalation of neonatal abstinence syndrome incidence, prompting the US Congress to pass the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015. This act specifically calls for a critical review of current treatment options for prenatal opioid abuse which may ultimately lead to the development of better therapies and a decreased incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome. Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends methadone, buprenorphine, or buprenorphine/naloxone in the treatment of prenatal opioid abuse. In this review, each maintenance therapy treatment option is discussed and compared revealing inconsistencies in postpartum retention rates, effects on fetal development, and availability to patients due to restrictions in health care coverage. Although each of these treatment options reduces opioid abuse and potential negative outcomes for the fetus, the shortcomings of these drugs highlight the overarching need for an improved standard of care. Drug developers and lawmakers should consider that affordability, coverage by health insurance, and success in retention rates substantially impacts the decision of the patient and healthcare provider regarding utilization of a particular opioid maintenance therapy.",

PubMed was searched and literature was reviewed on the effectiveness, safety, and side effect profiles of abstinence-based treatment, buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, and methadone treatment. Both observational and interventional studies were included. Both methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone are substantially more effective than abstinence-based treatment. Methadone has higher treatment retention rates than buprenorphine-naloxone does, while buprenorphine-naloxone has a lower risk of overdose. For all patient groups, physicians should recommend methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone treatment over abstinence-based treatment (level I evidence). Methadone is preferred over buprenorphine-naloxone for patients at higher risk of treatment dropout, such as injection opioid users (level I evidence). Youth and pregnant women who inject opioids should also receive methadone first (level III evidence). If buprenorphine-naloxone is prescribed first, the patient should be promptly switched to methadone if withdrawal symptoms, cravings, or opioid use persist despite an optimal buprenorphine-naloxone dose (level II evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is recommended for socially stable prescription oral opioid users, particularly if their work or family commitments make it difficult for them to attend the pharmacy daily, if they have a medical or psychiatric condition requiring regular primary care (level IV evidence), or if their jobs require higher levels of cognitive functioning or psychomotor performance (level III evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is also recommended for patients at high risk of methadone toxicity, such as the elderly, those taking high doses of benzodiazepines or other sedating drugs, heavy drinkers, those with a lower level of opioid tolerance, and those at high risk of prolonged QT interval (level III evidence). Individual patient characteristics and preferences should be taken into consideration when choosing a first-line opioid agonist treatment. For patients at high risk of dropout (such as adolescents and socially unstable patients), treatment retention should take precedence over other clinical considerations. For patients with high risk of toxicity (such as patients with heavy alcohol or benzodiazepine use), safety would likely be the first consideration.

In 1974, Congress gave the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) additional oversight of methadone treatment programs. Efforts to liberalize the FDA regulations over the past 30 years have been resisted by both the DEA and existing treatment providers. Additional flexibility for clinicians may evolve from the most recent effort to create an accreditation system to replace some of the FDA regulations. The development of buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, as an effective treatment for opioid addiction reopened the possibility for having a less burdensome oversight process, especially because of its reduced toxicity if ingested by non-tolerant individuals. New legislation, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000, created an opportunity for clinicians with special training to be exempted from both federal methadone regulations and the requirement to obtain a special DEA license when using buprenorphine to treat addicts. Some details of how the DATA was developed, moved through Congress, and signed into law are described.",

The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of buprenorphine make it unique in the armamentarium of drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction. Buprenorphine has partial mu-opioid receptor agonist activity and is a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist; hence, it can substitute for other micro-opioid receptor agonists, yet is less apt to produce overdose reactions or dysphoria. On the other hand, buprenorphine can block the effects of opioids such as heroin (diamorphine) and morphine, and can even precipitate withdrawal in individuals physically dependent upon these drugs. Buprenorphine has significant sublingual bioavailability and a long half-life, making administration on a less than daily basis possible. Furthermore, its discontinuation is associated with only a mild withdrawal syndrome. Clinical trials have demonstrated that sublingual buprenorphine is effective in both maintenance therapy and detoxification of individuals addicted to opioids. The introduction of a sublingual formulation combining naloxone with buprenorphine further reduces the risk of diversion to illicit intravenous use. Because of its relative safety and lower risk of illegal diversion, buprenorphine has been made available in several countries for treating opioid addiction in the private office setting, greatly enhancing treatment options for this condition.",

However, current persistent luminescence agents are rare and limited to inorganic nanoparticles. This study reports the design principle, synthesis, and proof-of-concept application of organic semiconducting nanoparticles (OSNs) with ultralong phosphorescence for in vivo afterglow imaging. The design principle leverages the formation of aggregates through a top-down nanoparticle formulation to greatly stabilize the triplet excited states of a phosphorescent molecule. This prolongs the particle luminesce to the timescale that can be detected by the commercial whole-animal imaging system after removal of external light source. Such ultralong phosphorescent of OSNs is inert to oxygen and can be repeatedly activated, permitting imaging of lymph nodes in living mice with a high signal-to-noise ratio. This study not only introduces the first category of water-soluble ultralong phosphorescence organic nanoparticles but also reveals a universal design principle to prolong the lifetime of phosphorescent molecules to the level that can be effective for molecular imaging.",

In a phase 2 study, romosozumab increased areal BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip as measured by DXA compared with placebo, alendronate, and teriparatide in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. In additional analyses from this international, randomized study, we now describe the effect of romosozumab on lumbar spine and hip volumetric BMD (vBMD) and BMC at month 12 as assessed by QCT in the subset of participants receiving placebo, s.c. teriparatide (20 \u00b5g once daily), and s.c. romosozumab (210 mg once monthly). QCT measurements were performed at the lumbar spine (mean of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> entire vertebral bodies, excluding posterior processes) and hip. One year of treatment with romosozumab significantly increased integral vBMD and BMC at the lumbar spine and total hip from baseline, and compared with placebo and teriparatide (all p &lt; 0.05). Trabecular vertebral vBMD improved significantly and similarly from baseline (p &lt; 0.05) with both romosozumab (18.3%) and teriparatide (20.1%), whereas cortical vertebral vBMD gains were larger with romosozumab compared with teriparatide (13.7% versus 5.7%, p &lt; 0.0001). Trabecular hip vBMD gains were significantly larger with romosozumab than with teriparatide (10.8% versus 4.2%, p = 0.01), but were similar for cortical vBMD (1.1% versus -0.9%, p = 0.12).

Serum bone formation markers were increased by Romo during the first 6 months, corresponding to increased cancellous, endocortical, and periosteal bone formation in rib and iliac biopsies at months 3 and 6. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone mineral density (BMD) was increased by 14% to 26% at the lumbar spine and proximal femur at month 12, corresponding to significant increases in bone strength at 3 and 30 mg/kg in lumbar vertebral bodies and cancellous cores, and at 30 mg/kg in the femur diaphysis and neck. Bone mass remained positively correlated with strength at these sites, with no changes in calculated material properties at cortical sites. These bone-quality measures were also maintained in the 30/0 group, despite a gradual loss of accrued bone mass. Normal bone mineralization was confirmed by histomorphometry and ash analyses. At the radial diaphysis, a transient, reversible 2% reduction in cortical BMD was observed with Romo at month 6, despite relative improvements in bone mineral content (BMC). High-resolution pQCT confirmed this decline in cortical BMD at the radial diaphysis and metaphysis in a second set of OVX cynos administered 3 mg/kg Romo for 6 months. Radial diaphyseal strength was maintained and metaphyseal strength improved with Romo as estimated by finite element modeling. Decreased radial cortical BMD was a consequence of increased intracortical remodeling, with no increase in cortical porosity.

Here we use three-dimensional dynamic histomorphometry to determine longitudinal changes in vertebral trabecular microarchitecture in adolescent male cynomolgus monkeys (4-5 years old) treated with sclerostin antibody. Animals were treated bi-weekly with either sclerostin antibody (30 mg/kg, sc, n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) for 10 weeks. Animals were administered fluorochrome bone formation labels on days 14 and 24 (tetracycline) and on days 56 and 66 (calcein), followed by necropsy on day 70. Cylindrical specimens of cancellous bone from the 5th lumbar vertebrae were used to generate high-resolution, three-dimensional images of bone and fluorescent labels of bone formation (0.7 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 5.0 \u00b5m/voxel). The three-dimensional images of the bone formation labels were used to determine the bone volume formed between days 14 and 66 and the resulting alterations in trabecular microarchitecture within each bone. Treatment with sclerostin antibody resulted in a conversion of rod-like trabeculae into plate-like trabeculae at a higher rate than in vehicle-treated animals (p = 0.01). Plate bone volume fraction was greater in the sclerostin antibody group relative to vehicle (mean 43 vs. 30%, p &lt; 0.05). Bone formation increased the thickness of trabeculae in all three trabecular orientations (axial, oblique, and transverse, p &lt; 0.05).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28458516": "Increased understanding of bone biology has led to the discovery of several unique signaling pathways that regulate bone formation and resorption. The Wnt signaling pathway plays a significant role in skeletal development, adult skeletal homeostasis, and bone remodeling. Sclerostin is an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway. Romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to sclerostin, prevents sclerostin from exerting this inhibitory effect. Therefore, in the presence of romosozumab, the Wnt signaling pathway is activated leading to bone formation and bone mineral density gain. Clinical studies of romosozumab have shown that this agent is one of the most potent bone anabolic agents in development to date. Romosozumab does not act solely as an anabolic agent, but rather, it has effects on increasing bone formation as well as reducing bone resorption. In the clinical studies, patients tolerated romosozumab well with no major safety signals reported. In a Phase III study, romosozumab as compared to placebo has been shown to reduce vertebral fractures by 73% after 1 year of treatment. Sequential therapy with romosozumab for 1 year followed by denosumab in the second year reduced vertebral fractures by 75% as compared to the group that received placebo for 1 year and denosumab in the second year. Romosozumab holds significant potential, by a novel mechanism of action, to expand our ability to treat osteoporosis.

The effects on bone formation are transient, eliciting a rapid increase in bone formation that attenuates with continued treatment. Although bone formation attenuates, bone mineral density (BMD) continues to increase. To explore potential tissue-level mechanisms that could contribute to a progressive increase in spine BMD, we used kinetic reconstruction techniques to examine the effects of romosozumab on modeling and remodeling units in vertebral cancellous bone from adult cynomolgus monkeys administered romosozumab for 10 and 28weeks. The 10-week study duration captured a period of high modeling-based bone formation, and the 28-week study duration followed the self-regulation or attenuation of bone formation in cancellous bone that occurs with long-term treatment. Sequential fluorochrome labels applied for the kinetic reconstruction were also used to evaluate treatment effects on osteoblast function as early as 3weeks, and on bone formation and bone accrual in the vertebral cortex over 28weeks. Kinetic reconstruction of remodeling and modeling formation sites in vertebral cancellous bone revealed that romosozumab effected significant transient increases in mineral apposition rate in remodeling sites at week 3 that was not sustained with continued treatment. However, romosozumab treatment caused sustained improvement in fractional labeling of osteoid, an index of osteoblast efficiency, at remodeling formative sites at both weeks 10 and 28 that was the major contributor to significant increases in final wall thickness (W.Th) of remodeling packets. Remodeling W.Th matched the final W.Th of modeling packets at week 10. At both weeks 10 and 28, romosozumab significantly decreased eroded surface (ES/BS). At week 28, romosozumab also significantly reduced resorption period (Rs.P) and final resorption depth (Rs.De). The reduced final Rs.De combined with the increased W.Th resulted in a significant increase in bone balance (BB) at the level of the remodeling unit. Assessment of bone formation on the vertebral periosteal and endocortical surfaces following 28weeks of treatment revealed that romosozumab significantly increased bone formation on these surfaces, which had attenuated by week 28, resulting in significant increases in new periosteal and endocortical bone by week 28. These data suggest that multiple factors potentially contribute to the increase in spine BMD with romosozumab treatment. In the early period of treatment, increased modeling-based bone formation, increased W.Th at remodeling sites, a decrease in remodeling space secondary to decreased ES/BS in vertebral cancellous bone, and increased periosteal and endocortical bone formation in the vertebral cortex contribute to the early increase in spine BMD. Following the self-regulation of bone formation when modeling-based bone formation has attenuated, a decrease in remodeling space secondary to reduced ES/BS and a positive BB secondary to decreased final Rs.De and increased W.Th contribute to the progressive increase in spine BMD with long-term treatment.",

Weight-of-evidence factors used in the assessment of human carcinogenic risk of romosozumab included features of canonical Wnt signaling, expression pattern of sclerostin, phenotype of loss-of-function mutations in humans and mice, mode and mechanism of action of romosozumab, and findings from romosozumab chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. Although the weight-of-evidence factors supported that romosozumab would pose a low carcinogenic risk to humans, the carcinogenic potential of romosozumab was assessed in a rat lifetime study.

Currently available strong anti-resorptive agents are bisphosphonates and an anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) antibody, denosumab. Although bisphosphonates and denosumab both inhibit bone resorption and prevent vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, their mechanisms of action are different. Whereas bisphosphonates' effects on bone mineral density and fracture peak around 3 to 5 years and become plateaued, those of denosumab are maintained for up to 10 years. There are differences in the modes of action of these two drugs. Bisphosphonates accumulate on the mineralized bone surface and are released by the acid environment under osteoclastic bone resorption, whereas denosumab is not accumulated on bone but directly binds RANKL and inhibits its binding to the receptor RANK. Thus, the reduction in denosumab concentration 4 to 6 months after injection may enable RANK to bind to RANKL, where it is highly expressed, such as in damaged bone regions. As anabolic agents, only teriparatide has been available for a long time, but abaloparatide, a synthetic analog of PTHrP(1-34), is currently under development. Because of the difference in the preferential binding conformations of PTH1 receptor between teriparatide and abaloparatide, the latter shows anabolic effects with fewer bone resorptive effects.

However, the molecular mechanisms of modulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation, especially at the priming step, are still poorly understood. This study was designed to elucidate the negative regulation of nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. We reported that Nrf2 activation inhibited NLRP3 expression, caspase-1 cleavage, and subsequent IL-1\u03b2 generation. Compared with normal cells, Nrf2-deficient cells showed upregulated cleaved caspase-1, which were attributed to the increased transcription of NLRP3 caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome was sensitive to the exogenous ROS levels induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or rotenone. Combined with adenosine triphosphate, rotenone triggered higher activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome compared with lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that ROS promoted the priming step. In addition, Nrf2-induced NQO1 was involved in the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In an in vivo alum-induced peritonitis mouse model, Nrf2 activation suppressed typical IL-1 signaling-dependent inflammation, whereas Nrf2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a significant increase in the recruitment of immune cell and the generation of IL-1\u03b2 compared with wild-type mice. We elucidated the effects and possible mechanisms of Nrf2 activation-induced NQO1 expression on NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation and established a novel regulatory role of the Nrf2 pathway in ROS-induced NLRP3 priming.

Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) is the principal pro-fibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with side effects due to its pleiotropic roles. We hypothesized that downstream effectors of TGF\u03b21 in fibroblasts could be attractive therapeutic targets and lack upstream toxicity. Here we show, using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, that upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) is the dominant transcriptional response to TGF\u03b21 exposure and required for its pro-fibrotic effect. IL-11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts, in which they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il-11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure, whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 protects against disease. Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These results reveal a central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose that inhibition of IL-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases.",

E4-associated phenotypes and insulin resistance (IR) share several features and appear to interact in driving cognitive dysfunction. However, shared mechanisms that could explain their overlapping pathophysiology have yet to be found. We hypothesized that, compared to E3 mice, E4 mice would be more susceptible to the harmful cognitive effects of high fat diet (HFD)-induced IR due to apoE isoform-specific differences in brain metabolism. While both E3 and E4 mice fed HFD displayed impairments in peripheral metabolism and cognition, deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory were exaggerated in E4 mice. Combining genome-wide measures of DNA hydroxymethylation with comprehensive untargeted metabolomics, we identified novel alterations in purine metabolism, glutamate metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Finally, in E4 mice, the metabolic and cognitive deficiencies caused by HFD were rescued by switching to a low fat diet for one month, suggesting a functional role was associated with reversal of the same metabolic pathways described above. These results suggest a susceptibility of E4 carriers to metabolic impairments brought on by IR, and may guide development of novel therapies for cognitive decline and dementia.",

To elucidate the underlying vascular origin of neurodegenerative processes in AD, we investigated the relation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) cerebral blood flow (CBF) and vasoreactivity with brain structure and function in a 16-18 months old double transgenic A\u03b2PP<sub>swe</sub>/PS1<sub>dE9</sub> (A\u03b2PP/PS1) mouse model for AD. These aging A\u03b2PP/PS1 mice showed an increased SBP linked to a declined regional CBF. Furthermore, using advanced MRI techniques, decline of functional and structural connectivity was revealed in the AD-like mice coupled to impaired cognition, increased locomotor activity, and anxiety-related behavior. Post mortem analyses demonstrated also increased neuroinflammation, and both decreased synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the A\u03b2PP/PS1 mice. Additionally, deviant levels of fatty acids and sterols were present in the brain tissue of the A\u03b2PP/PS1 mice indicating maladapted brain fatty acid metabolism. Our findings suggest a link between increased SBP, decreased cerebral hemodynamics and connectivity in an AD mouse model during aging, leading to behavioral and cognitive impairments. As these results mirror the complex clinical symptomatology in the prodromal phase of AD, we suggest that this AD-like murine model could be used to investigate prevention and treatment strategies for early AD patients. Moreover, this study helps to develop more efficient therapies and diagnostics for this very early stage of AD.",

It is thought that extracellular A\u03b2 triggers toxic signals leading to neurodegeneration. The events downstream of A\u03b2 however are not entirely clear. Clusterin (Apo J) is one of the major risk factors for sporadic form of AD. Clusterin binds to A\u03b2 and prevents A\u03b2 aggregation. In addition, clusterin promotes A\u03b2 degradation and accelerates A\u03b2 clearance from the brain. Clusterin thus protects neurons from A\u03b2 and loss of clusterin level in the brain is implicated as promoting AD pathology. In this study, we found that the level of clusterin protein but not mRNA is reduced in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. When rat hippocampal primary neurons were treated with A\u03b21-42, level of clusterin protein but not mRNA was downregulated. A\u03b21-42-induced downregulation of clusterin was blocked by lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride. In neurons, A\u03b21-42 induced expression of sortilin, a lysosomal sorting protein that targets proteins to lysosome for degradation. In BE(2) M17 human neuroblastoma cells, clusterin bound to sortilin and when sortilin expression was silenced, A\u03b21-42-induced clusterin downregulation was almost completely blocked. Our data demonstrate that in neurons, A\u03b21-42 promotes lysosomal degradation of clusterin by inducing expression of sortilin and provide a novel mechanism by which A\u03b2 promotes AD pathogenesis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884281": "Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) disorders like stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, CNS diseases like AD have been associated with gliosis and impaired neurogenesis. Further, renin angiotensin system (RAS) is intricately associated with hypertension; however, the accumulating evidences suggest that over-activity of RAS may perpetuate the brain inflammation related with AD. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of hypertension and RAS on glial (astrocytes and microglia) activation and hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of chronic hypertension. We used Candesartan [angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB)] both at a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) and anti-hypertensive dose (2 mg/kg) to explore whether their effect on astrocyte and microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis is blood pressure (BP) dependent or independent. Our data revealed that hypertension induces robust microglial and astrocyte activation, neuroinflammation, and cripples hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, AT1R blockade by Candesartan, even at low dose (0.1 mg/kg), prevented astrocyte and microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the brain of hypertensive rats. Mechanistically, AT1R blockade prevented the activation of NADPH oxidase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of MAP kinase and NF\u043aB signaling. Importantly, we, for the first time to our knowledge, provided the evidence that AT1R blockade by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, promotes neurogenesis during hypertensive state. We conclude that AT1R blockade prevents astrocyte and microglial activation and improves hippocampal neurogenesis in hypertensive state, independent of BP lowering action.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27300264": "The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing. Major risk factors for AD are advancing age and diabetes. Lately, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of dementia. Obese and diabetic individuals are prone to decreased circulating levels of zinc, reducing the amount of zinc available for crucial intracellular processes. In the brain, zinc co-localizes with glutamate in synaptic vesicles, and modulates NMDA receptor activity. Intracellular zinc is involved in apoptosis and fluctuations in cytoplasmic Zn(2+) affect modulation of intracellular signaling. The ZNT and ZIP proteins participate in intracellular zinc homeostasis. Altered expression of zinc-regulatory proteins has been described in AD patients. Using microarray data from human frontal cortex (BrainCloud), this study investigates expression of the SCLA30A (ZNT) and SCLA39A (ZIP) families of genes in a Caucasian and African-American sample of 145 neurologically and psychiatrically normal individuals. Expression of ZNT3 and ZNT4 were significantly reduced with increasing age, whereas expression of ZIP1, ZIP9 and ZIP13 were significantly increased. Increasing body mass index (BMI) correlated with a significant reduction in ZNT1 expression similar to what is seen in the early stages of AD. Increasing BMI also correlated with reduced expression of ZNT6. In conclusion, we found that the expression of genes that regulate intracellular zinc homeostasis in the human frontal cortex is altered with increasing age and affected by increasing BMI. With the increasing rates of obesity throughout the world, these findings warrant continuous scrutiny of the long-term consequences of obesity on brain function and the development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study was performed at a tertiary care, academic medical center ED with approximately 60 000 annual visits and included all patients who were suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE) and who underwent CT pulmonary angiography between January 1, 2011, and August 31, 2013. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Each CT order for pulmonary angiography was exposed to CDS on the basis of the Wells criteria. For patients with a Wells score of 4 or less, CDS alerts suggested d-dimer testing because acute PE is highly unlikely in these patients if d-dimer levels are normal. The yield of CT pulmonary angiography (number of positive PE diagnoses/total number of CT pulmonary angiographic examinations) was compared in patients in whom providers overrode CDS alerts (by performing CT pulmonary angiography in patients with a Wells score \u22644 and a normal d-dimer level or no d-dimer testing) (override group) and those in whom providers followed Wells criteria (CT pulmonary angiography only in patients with Wells score &gt;4 or \u22644 with elevated d-dimer level) (adherent group). A validated natural language processing tool identified positive PE diagnoses, with subsegmental and/or indeterminate diagnoses removed by means of chart review. Statistical analysis was performed with the \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test, the Student t test, and logistic regression. Results Among 2993 CT pulmonary angiography studies in 2655 patients, 563 examinations had a Wells score of 4 or less but did not undergo d-dimer testing and 26 had a Wells score of 4 or less and had normal d-dimer levels. The yield of CT pulmonary angiography was 4.2% in the override group (25 of 589 studies, none with a normal d-dimer level) and 11.2% in the adherent group (270 of 2404 studies) (P &lt; .001). After adjustment for the risk factor differences between the two groups, the odds of an acute PE finding were 51.3% lower when providers overrode alerts than when they followed CDS guidelines. Comparison of the two groups including only patients unlikely to have PE led to similar results. Conclusion The odds of an acute PE finding in the ED when providers adhered to evidence presented in CDS were nearly double those seen when providers overrode CDS alerts. Most overrides were due to the lack of d-dimer testing in patients unlikely to have PE. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2016.",

Overall CTPE diagnostic yield was 9.8% (779/7987 studies positive for PE). Yield increased a relative 30.8% after CDS implementation (8.1% vs. 10.6%; p=0.0003). There was no statistically significant change in CTPE utilization (1.4% pre- vs. 1.4% post-implementation; p=0.25). A statistical process control chart demonstrated immediate and sustained improvement in CTPE yield post-implementation. Interrupted time series analysis demonstrated the slope of PE findings versus time to be unchanged before and after the intervention (p=0.9). However, there was a trend that the intervention was associated with a 50% increased probability of PE finding (p=0.08), suggesting an immediate rather than gradual change after the intervention. Implementing evidence-based CDS in the ED was associated with an immediate, significant and sustained increase in CTPE yield without a measurable decrease in CTPE utilization.

Clinical probability of PE was determined according to the Wells and modified Wells scoring system. CTPA was performed in 60 patients. The degree of pulmonary vascular obstruction was quantified by the Qanadli index. Low clinical probability of PE was present in one patient (1.6%), moderate in 43 (71.6%) and high in 16 (26.6%) patients. PE was confirmed in 50 (83.3%) patients. There were 21 patients (42%) whose Quanadli index was &lt;25%, 18 (36%) between 25%-50%, while Quanadli index was \u226550 in 11 patients (22%).

We investigated the sensitivity of multidetector CT among 134 patients with a high probability of PE. A normal CT alone may not safely exclude PE in patients with a high clinical pretest probability. In patients with no clear alternative diagnosis after CTPA, further testing should be strongly considered. Whether patients with a negative multidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) result and a high clinical pretest probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) should be further investigated is controversial. This was a prospective investigation of the sensitivity of multidetector CTPA among patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE according to the Wells criteria. Among patients with a negative CTPA result, the diagnosis of PE required at least one of the following conditions: ventilation/perfusion lung scan showing a high probability of PE in a patient with no history of PE, abnormal findings on venous ultrasonography in a patient without previous deep vein thrombosis at that site, or the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a 3-month follow-up period after anticoagulation was withheld because of a negative multidetector CTPA result. We identified 498 patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE and a completed CTPA study. CTPA excluded PE in 134 patients; in these patients, the pooled incidence of VTE was 5.2% (seven of 134 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-9.0). Five patients had VTEs that were confirmed by an additional imaging test despite a negative CTPA result (five of 48 patients; 10.4%; 95% CI 1.8-19.1), and two patients had objectively confirmed VTEs that occurred during clinical follow-up of at least 3 months (two of 86 patients; 2.3%; 95% CI 0-5.5).

This was a prospective observational study. Trained research assistants enrolled patients during 120 random 8-hour shifts. Patients who underwent imaging for pulmonary embolism after a medical history, physical examination, and chest radiograph were enrolled. Treating providers and research assistants determined pretest probability according to Wells Criteria in a blinded fashion. Two d -dimer assays were run.

EHS episodes were perceived as having a random course, but were most likely to occur during wake-sleep transitions and when sleeping in a supine position. Only 11% reported EHS to a professional, and 8% of those with recurrent EHS attempted to prevent episodes. Conclusions EHS episodes are complex (Mean (M) = 4.5 additional symptoms), often multisensorial, and usually associated with clinically-significant fear. They are rarely reported to professionals and treatment approaches are limited.",

Although episodes by themselves are relatively harmless, it is a frightening phenomenon that may result in clinical consequences. At present there are little systematic data on exploding head syndrome, and prevalence rates are unknown. It has been hypothesized to be rare and to occur primarily in older (i.e. 50+ years) individuals, females, and those suffering from isolated sleep paralysis. In order to test these hypotheses, 211 undergraduate students were assessed for both exploding head syndrome and isolated sleep paralysis using semi-structured diagnostic interviews: 18.00% of the sample experienced lifetime exploding head syndrome, this reduced to 16.60% for recurrent cases. Though not more common in females, it was found in 36.89% of those diagnosed with isolated sleep paralysis. Exploding head syndrome episodes were accompanied by clinically significant levels of fear, and a minority (2.80%) experienced it to such a degree that it was associated with clinically significant distress and/or impairment. Contrary to some earlier theorizing, exploding head syndrome was found to be a relatively common experience in younger individuals. Given the potential clinical impacts, it is recommended that it be assessed more regularly in research and clinical settings.",

We present six new cases extending the clinical experience with the syndrome. We also reviewed all available cases from the scientific literature and evaluated the typical features of EHS. The female to male ratio is 1.5 to 1. The median age at onset is 54. In average, one attack per day to one attack per week occurs. Some patients suffer from several attacks per night. In about half of all patients, a chronic time course can be observed but episodic or sporadic occurrence is also common. The most frequent accompanying symptoms beside the noise are fear and flashes of light. Polysomnographic studies do not reveal any specific sleep pattern associated with EHS. Tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in some patients. However, most patients do not need treatment because of the benign nature of the syndrome.

Therefore, a comprehensive review of the scientific literature using Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and PubMed was undertaken. After first discussing the history, prevalence, and associated features, the available polysomnography data and five main etiological theories for exploding head syndrome are summarized.

Five patients reported explosions during the recording sessions. According to the recordings, the attacks always took place when the patients were awake and relaxed. In two cases abrupt electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic changes indicating increasing alertness were recorded at the time of the reported attacks. In the remaining three cases no EEG changes were seen. Thus, there were no indications of an epileptic etiology to the condition. In all patients the symptoms ameliorated spontaneously with time. The severity of the symptoms was reduced by reassurance of the harmlessness of the condition. Clomipramine was prescribed to three patients who all reported immediate relief of symptoms.

ADAM17 protein, a major ErbB ligand sheddase, is upregulated in NSCLC and is required not only for heregulin-dependent HER3 signaling, but also for EGFR ligand-dependent signaling in NSCLC cell lines. A selective ADAM inhibitor, INCB3619, prevents the processing and activation of multiple ErbB ligands, including heregulin. In addition, INCB3619 inhibits gefitinib-resistant HER3 signaling and enhances gefitinib inhibition of EGFR signaling in NSCLC. These results show that ADAM inhibition affects multiple ErbB pathways in NSCLC and thus offers an excellent opportunity for pharmacological intervention, either alone or in combination with other drugs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17363546": " ErbB receptor signaling pathways are important regulators of cell fate, and their dysregulation, through (epi)genetic alterations, plays an etiologic role in multiple cancers. ErbB ligands are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors that are cleaved by members of the ADAM family of zinc-dependent metalloproteases. This processing, termed ectodomain shedding, is essential for the functional activation of ErbB ligands. Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of ErbB ligands may circumvent the effectiveness of ErbB-targeted therapeutics. Here, we describe the discovery and preclinical development of potent, selective inhibitors of ErbB ligand shedding. A series of biochemical and cell-based assays were established to identify selective inhibitors of ErbB ligand shedding. The therapeutic potential of these compounds was assessed in multiple in vivo models of cancer and matrix metalloprotease-related toxicity. INCB3619 was identified as a representative selective, potent, orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of a subset of ADAM proteases that block shedding of ErbB ligands. Administration of INCB3619 to tumor-bearing mice reduced ErbB ligand shedding in vivo and inhibited ErbB pathway signaling (e.g., phosphorylation of Akt), tumor cell proliferation, and survival. Further, INCB3619 synergized with clinically relevant cancer therapeutics and showed no overt or compounding toxicities, including fibroplasia, the dose-limiting toxicity associated with broad-spectrum matrix metalloprotease inhibitors. Inhibition of ErbB ligand shedding offers a potentially novel and well-tolerated therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human cancers and is currently being evaluated in the clinic.",

However, there is a scientific discussion ongoing about the target engagement of these antibodies. Here, we report the immunohistochemical staining profiles of biosimilar antibodies of Solanezumab, Crenezumab and Bapineuzumab in human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and human fresh frozen tissue. Furthermore, we performed a direct comparative immunohistochemistry analysis of the biosimilar versions of the humanized antibodies in different mouse models including 5XFAD, Tg4-42, TBA42, APP/PS1KI, 3xTg. The staining pattern with these humanized antibodies revealed a surprisingly similar profile. All three antibodies detected plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and intraneuronal A\u03b2 in a similar fashion. Remarkably, Solanezumab showed a strong binding affinity to plaques. We also reaffirmed that Bapineuzumab does not recognize N-truncated or modified A\u03b2, while Solanezumab and Crenezumab do detect N-terminally modified A\u03b2 peptides A\u03b24-42 and pyroglutamate A\u03b23-42. In addition, we compared the results with the staining pattern of the mouse NT4X antibody that recognizes specifically A\u03b24-42 and pyroglutamate A\u03b23-42, but not full-length A\u03b21-42. In contrast to the biosimilar antibodies of Solanezumab, Crenezumab and Bapineuzumab, the murine NT4X antibody shows a unique target engagement. NT4X does barely cross-react with amyloid plaques in human tissue. It does, however, detect cerebral amyloid angiopathy in human tissue. In Alzheimer mouse models, NT4X detects intraneuronal A\u03b2 and plaques comparable to the humanized antibodies. In conclusion, the biosimilar antibodies Solanezumab, Crenezumab and Bapineuzumab strongly react with amyloid plaques, which are in contrast to the NT4X antibody that hardly recognizes plaques in human tissue.

Retrospective study and review of the literature. Five patients with calciphylaxis treated at our institution were evaluated for mortality, surgical and perioperative complications, wound healing, and predictors of patient outcomes. Two patients died from sepsis and infectious complications of their calciphylaxis shortly after surgery. Of the three survivors, two later died (15 and 18 mo after surgery) from causes not directly related to calciphylaxis. The other long-term survivor required partial amputation of a leg for osteomyelitis. There was one operative complication-- wound infection requiring antibiotic therapy, drainage, and packing. Postoperative hypocalcemia required treatment in two patients. Immediate perioperative survival was more likely in patients with leukocyte counts less than 20,000 cells/mL. Calciphylaxis is a serious disease and patients often succumb to sepsis and infectious complications. Patients with extremely high leukocyte counts from coexistent infections may have a worse prognosis. Although a conclusive effective therapy does not exist, parathyroidectomy can be safely performed and may benefit some patients with what is often an otherwise fatal disease.

Pulmonary calciphylaxis is a usually fatal medical condition that may occur in association with skin involvement in patients with end-stage renal disease.We report here the case of a 49-year-old woman homozygous sickle cell disease patient on chronic hemodialysis with biopsy-proven systemic calciphylaxis involving the lungs and skin. On admission, ulcerative skin lesions on the lower limbs and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest computerized tomography scan were the main clinical and radiological findings. Skin and bronchial biopsies demonstrated calciphylaxis lesions. The intravenous administration of STS in association with cinacalcet for 8 consecutive months led to a clear improvement in skin lesions and thoracic lesions on chest computerized tomography scan.This case suggests for the first time that organ lesions related to calciphylaxis, and particularly lung injury, are potentially reversible. This improvement probably resulted from the combination of 3 interventions (more frequent dialysis, cinacalcet, and STS), rather than the administration of STS alone.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068711": " Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops often in chronic hemodialysis patients. However, there have been several case reports on calciphylaxis in patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome, a systemic disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In 76 POEMS patients and 86 age- and gender-matched disease controls, we studied abnormal small vessel calcification by computed tomography (CT) of the soft tissues. Clinical and laboratory profiles were compared between POEMS patients with and without calciphylaxis. Histological examination was performed in six autopsy cases. Small vessel calcification on CT was found in 17 % of POEMS patients and in none of the controls (P &lt; 0.001). Autopsy confirmed calciphylaxis in 2 (33 %) patients. Among POEMS patients, higher disease activity, including more severe neuropathy and ascites, higher serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower serum albumin levels, was associated with the development of calciphylaxis. Serum levels of creatinine, calcium, and phosphate were not related to the presence of calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS syndrome. Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and interleukin-6 may contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by entirely different mechanism from that in chronic dialysis. POEMS syndrome should be recognized as a potential cause of calciphylaxis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26779700": "Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification in the medium and small vessel arterioles and can be a life-threatening complication often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A review of the literature was conducted to explore existing evidence about the relationship between obesity and calciphylaxis. A total of 54 publications (published between 1962 and 2015) were identified. Most studies noted a variety of risk factors for calciphylaxis, including CKD, female gender, Caucasian race, liver disease, and lower serum albumin. Obesity was identified as a risk factor in 6 of the 8 studies reviewed. In one study, obesity was found to increase the risk of calciphylaxis 4-fold. The majority of calciphylaxis lesions in obese persons were proximal in distribution; all studies report proximal lesions are associated with a higher mortality rate than distal lesions. The mortality rate of persons with CKD and calciphylaxis is 8 times higher than that of persons with CKD without calciphylaxis. There is no definitive evidence to support the belief current epidemic rates of obesity, diabetes, (diabesity), and chronic renal disease will predispose more patients to the development of calciphylaxis. However, until more information from the calciphylaxis registries and other studies is available, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when a patient presents with indurated, painful nodules or necrotic ulcers, especially if the patient also has CKD.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9426423": " Calciphylaxis is characterized by painful, violaceous, mottled skin lesions (livedo reticularis) that may progress to tissue necrosis, nonhealing ulcers, gangrene, and potentially amputation, sepsis, or death. The prevalence and characteristics of patients who have calciphylaxis need further identification to predict which patients on dialysis may benefit from close monitoring or early surgical intervention. All 242 patients undergoing hemodialysis in an outpatient unit were reviewed retrospectively during a 15-month cross-sectional study of the prevalence and characteristics of calciphylaxis. Ten patients (prevalence, 4.1%) had calciphylaxis. Patients with calciphylaxis were significantly younger (49 versus 60 years; p = 0.01), had undergone hemodialysis longer (80 versus 20 months; p &lt; 0.0001), and had higher median serum calcium (9.7 versus 9.2 mg/dl; p = 0.03), phosphate (8.2 versus 5.7 mg/dl; p = 0.001), calcium phosphate product (81.5 versus 52.9; p = 0.0004), parathyroid hormone (1496 versus 138 pg/ml; p &lt; 0.0001), and alkaline phosphatase levels (188 versus 89 IU/L; p = 0.0001). Bone surveys were positive in all 10 patients with calciphylaxis compared with 49 (21%) of the 232 patients without calciphylaxis (p &lt; 0.0001). All patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for calciphylaxis had dramatic healing of the ulcers. The presence of calciphylaxis is higher among younger patients who had undergone longer periods of hemodialysis. Therefore this group of patients should be monitored aggressively and treated expeditiously for complications of secondary hyperparathyroidism.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23430392": "Calciphylaxis is a relatively rare disease, observed mainly in patients on dialysis, associated with high mortality rates, and characterized by painful skin ulceration. The pathogenesis of calciphylaxis is virtually unknown, although several risk factors, including warfarin therapy, hypoalbuminemia, and disturbances in calcium-phosphate metabolism, have been reported. The prevalence of calciphylaxis in Japan is likely to be less than 1:10,000 dialysis patients per year based on our nationwide survey in 2009. However, the results of the survey also showed that about 60 % of nephrologists in Japan are not familiar with the disease itself and it is highly likely that calciphylaxis is being overlooked. To facilitate recognition of calciphylaxis, we have proposed diagnostic criteria. At present, there is no specific therapy for calciphylaxis and general supportive measures, especially antibiotics for the accompanying infection and wound care, are important. Recently, sodium thiosulfate has been increasingly used to treat calciphylaxis and its efficacy should be evaluated by large clinical trials.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16108246": "Calciphylaxis is a rare condition of induced systemic hypersensitivity in which tissues respond to appropriate challenging agents with a sudden local calcification. It is characterized by acute calcium deposition in the medial layer of small and intermediate dermal vasculature that can lead to epidermal ischemia, ulceration, and necrosis. Calciphylaxis typically occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing dialysis and who have secondary hyperparathyroidism. Even in this population the incidence is less than 1%. The cause of calciphylaxis is unknown. However, it has been suggested that deficiencies of protein C and protein S may play a role in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Our patient is the fourth with cirrhosis to be reported to have developed calciphylaxis and adds further evidence that low levels of these anticoagulant factors may be an important etiologic factor for development of calciphylaxis. This report should alert the clinician that calciphylaxis occurs in patients with cirrhosis and should stimulate further research concerning the possible role of protein C and protein S deficiency in calciphylaxis.",

We present a unique case of calciphylaxis in which the patient did not have end-stage renal disease. Instead, primary hyperparathyroidism and/or alcoholic cirrhosis were the more likely causes of her calciphylaxis. In addition, our case demonstrated not only calciphylaxis but also fragmentation and calcification of elastic fibers within the dermis, changes that are most often seen in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. This is the first reported case of calciphylaxis, to our knowledge, with histopathologic changes of pseudoxanthoma elasticum in a patient who is nonuremic.",

Lesions typically occur over areas of high fat content and progress to black leathery eschars. Calciphylaxis is associated with intense pain and markedly increased risk of infection, often leading to sepsis requiring hospitalization. Diagnosis is made by clinical history and skin biopsy. Management of calciphylaxis is interdisciplinary, emphasizing factors such as primary prevention, proper wound care, pain control, and hormone and mineral balance.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11273880": "Calciphylaxis is a severe complication of chronic renal failure, confined almost exclusively to patients on dialysis therapy. Histological characteristics of calciphylaxis include small-vessel calcifications of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and visceral organs. These vascular changes promote tissue ischemia that often results in tissue necrosis. In this study, we investigated the extent of skin ischemia in patients with calciphylaxis by means of transcutaneous oxygen tension (TCPO(2)) measurement, a noninvasive test that accurately assesses skin oxygenation. TCPO(2) levels were measured in 21 patients with calciphylaxis and 21 age- and sex-matched patients without evidence of calciphylaxis (controls). TCPO(2) levels were measured bilaterally at the chest, anterior abdomen, and upper thigh while patients breathed room air and after a 30-minute exposure to 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)). Compared with controls, patients with calciphylaxis showed significantly lower TCPO(2) levels at each body region. In both controls and patients with calciphylaxis, lower TCPO(2) levels correlated with increased weight and use of hemodialysis. No correlation with serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, or serum phosphorus values was present, although 39% of the patients with calciphylaxis had markedly elevated PTH values (sixfold greater than normal; &gt;300 pg/dL). Low TCPO(2) levels in patients with calciphylaxis were documented in body regions with and without skin lesions. In patients with calciphylaxis, extremely low TCPO(2) values (&lt;/=30 mm Hg while patients breathed room air) were present in 62% of the body regions with skin lesions and 26% of the body regions without lesions. Room-air TCPO(2) levels &lt;/=30 mm Hg were present in only 0.8% of the body regions of control patients. TCPO(2) levels obtained while patients breathed 100% FIO(2) remained lower in patients with calciphylaxis than in controls. In conclusion, TCPO(2) levels are abnormally low in patients with calciphylaxis, indicating that severe and diffuse skin ischemia exists, even at areas free of skin lesions. Low TCPO(2) values did not substantially increase with 100% FIO(2) in many patients with calciphylaxis, suggesting a fixed insufficiency of the skin vessels. This study shows that TCPO(2) measurements may allow rapid and noninvasive screening for skin ischemia before the development of skin lesions in patients with calciphylaxis.",

It most commonly occurs in end stage renal disease patients on dialysis or recently received renal transplant with chronic nephropathy allograft. The pathogenesis of calciphylaxis is poorly understood. Abnormalities in mineral metabolism are clearly involved, but the specific factors that induces this disorder are not completely known. Describe the main clinical features, outcomes and follow up of all calciphylaxis cases recorded in our dialysis unit in order to analyse the incidence, the main biologic parameters and the therapeutic background in which calciphylaxis appeared. We performed a descriptive study about all the calciphylaxis cases diagnosed at our dialysis unit between the years 1991 and 2005. 8 cases, 6 women. Mean age: 65.3 years. All the patients were on haemodialysis treatment (one previous renal transplant). Mean time on dialysis was 76.6 months. Cumulative incidence was 1.17%. The principal end stage renal disease aethiology was neprhoangioeslerosis in four patients. Secondary hiperparatyrhoidism was present in 4 patients and 2 of them had been paratyrhoidectomized previously. A second cutaneous biopsy was needed for correct diagnosis in 3 patients. Calciphylaxis distal lesions were present in 7 patients. Two cases required urgent paratyrhoidectomy in order to control calciphylaxis. Only in 2 cases a Ca x P product &gt; 60 mg/dL was present and 3 cases had PTHi values higher than 300 pg/mL. Calcium phosphate binders and vitamin D were present in 2 and 4 cases, respectively. One patient with proximal calciphylaxis died due to skin injury infection. Calciphylaxis is a rare disorder but not exceptional, related to end stage renal disease patients. The diagnosis requires a high clinical suspicion, being sometimes difficult to distinguish from other entities in spite of pathological study. Proximal distribution of calciphylaxis had worst prognostic. Metabolic disorders and therapeutics background were not different from other patients included in dialysis treatment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19317304": "Calciphylaxis is a rare complication that occurs in 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) each year. Extensive microvascular calcification and occlusion/thrombosis lead to violaceous skin lesions, which progress to nonhealing ulcers with secondary infection, often leading to sepsis and death. The lower extremities are predominantly involved (roughly 90% of patients). Although most calciphylaxis patients have abnormalities of the calcium-phosphate axis or elevated levels of parathyroid hormone, these abnormalities do not appear to be fundamental to the pathophysiology of the disorder. We report on a case of histologically proven calciphylaxis in a 54-year-old woman with normal renal function and normal calcium-parathyroid homeostasis. She had a history of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and was treated with warfarin anticoagulation. She has been successfully treated with antibiotics, i.v. biophosphonates and intensive local wound care. We recorded a complete wound healing in contrast to what is reported in other series.",

Although calciphylaxis is most frequently associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism, it has been reported infrequently among patients on warfarin. No standard treatment has been established for atypical calciphylaxis; however, a potentially beneficial treatment is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). A high degree of clinical suspicion, early diagnosis, and understanding the pathophysiology of this disease promotes the optimal management of this extremely morbid and often fatal condition. We present a 63-year-old Polynesian woman with biopsy-proven calciphylaxis in the absence of ESRD or elevated serum calcium levels while taking warfarin. Therapeutic dose enoxaparin was substituted for warfarin and she received 40 sessions of HBOT during which lower extremity ulcers resolved. Warfarin has been implicated when calciphylaxis presents in an atypical fashion. No guidelines exist for treatment of atypical calciphylaxis in the setting of concomitant warfarin therapy. Up to 80% of calciphylaxis patients die within 1 year of diagnosis. Our patient was changed to low-molecular-weight heparin and received HBOT. We present what we believe is the first case of atypical calciphylaxis thought to be attributable to warfarin treated with a therapeutic substitution of anticoagulant and HBOT leading to resolution of cutaneous lesions.",

It is unclear to what extent it involves other organs. To identify whether other organs are affected we reviewed pathology reports of patients with calciphylaxis who underwent autopsy at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2011. Three patients were identified: two patients had a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus before the diagnosis of calciphylaxis; the third patient had calciphylaxis associated with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma without end-stage renal disease. Autopsy reports showed that despite evidence of vessel calcification elsewhere, there was no evidence of calciphylaxis in other organs. All patients had histopathologic evidence of cardiovascular calcification, and atherosclerosis of coronary arteries and aorta. Calcification of pancreatic vessels and renal vessels was also noted. In this study population, calciphylaxis was a cutaneous process alone.",

In this study we examine the expression of osteopontin as a diagnostic marker and its role in lesional pathogenesis. 25 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded skin biopsies of 20 females and 5 males (mean age of 60 years) with a diagnosis of calciphylaxis were assessed for osteopontin expression. Lower extremities were the most commonly involved areas; however a truncal and genital distribution was also noted in 3 cases. Renal failure was present in 21 of 25 cases. One patient had myeloproliferative disorder and one patient had advanced colon cancer. The dominant pathology was localized to the subcutaneous fat, characterized by mural calcification and luminal thrombosis affecting capillaries, venules, arterioles and small arteries. In 2 cases, a subcutaneous thrombogenic vasculopathy without calcification was noted. Osteopontin expression was confined to the subcutis, being most striking in calcified vessels but also apparent in vessels without calcification, including mineral poor variants of calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis represents a unique calcific thrombogenic vasculopathy, not limited to renal failure. Ectopic osteopontin expression may define a critical and initial event in the calciphylaxis pathogenesis. Therapeutic agents designed to reduce osteopontin expression may be of value in its treatment.",
