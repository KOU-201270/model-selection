The potential mechanism of ALT is homology-directed telomere synthesis, but molecular mechanisms of how ALT maintains telomere length in human cancer is poorly understood. Here, we generated TERC (telomerase RNA) gene knockouts in telomerase positive cell lines that resulted in long-term surviving clones acquiring the ALT pathway but at a very low frequency. By comparing these ALT cells with parental telomerase positive cells, we observed that ALT cells possess excessively long telomeric overhangs derived from telomere elongation processes that mostly occur during S phase. ALT cells exhibited preferential elongation of the telomeric lagging strands, whereas telomerase positive cells exhibited similar elongation between leading and lagging strands. We propose that the ALT pathway preferentially occurs at telomeric lagging strands leading to heterogeneous telomere lengths observed in most ALT cancers.",

In line with this expression profile, Fgf21 was recently reported to protect against ageing-related thymic senescence by improving the function of thymic epithelial cells (TECs). However, the function of Fgf21 in the juvenile thymus remained to be elucidated. We investigated the physiological roles of Fgf21 in the juvenile thymus and found that young Fgf21 knockout mice, but not \u03b2-Klotho knockout mice nor adult Fgf21 knockout mice, showed a significant reduction in the percentage of single-positive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes without obvious alteration in TECs. Furthermore, treatment with recombinant FGF21 protein rescued the impairment in fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) of Fgf21 knockout mice. Annexin V staining revealed FGF21 protein enhanced apoptosis of immature thymocytes undergoing selection process in FTOC, suggesting that FGF21 may facilitate the selection of developing T cells. Endocrine Fgf21 from the liver induced by metabolic stimulation did not affect juvenile thymocyte development. Our data suggest that Fgf21 acts as one of intrathymic cytokines in the neonatal and juvenile thymus, involving thymocyte development in a \u03b2-Klotho-independent manner.",

Although highest levels of expression are in pancreas, little is known about the function of FGF21 in this tissue. In order to understand the physiology of FGF21 in the pancreas, we analyzed its expression and regulation in both acinar and islet tissues. We found that acinar tissue express 20-fold higher levels than that observed in islets. We also observed that pancreatic FGF21 is nutritionally regulated; a marked reduction in FGF21 expression was noted with fasting while obesity is associated with 3-4 fold higher expression. Acinar and islet cells are targets of FGF21, which when systemically administered, leads to phosphorylation of the downstream target ERK 1/2 in about half of acinar cells and a small subset of islet cells. Chronic, systemic FGF21 infusion down-regulates its own expression in the pancreas. Mice lacking FGF21 develop significant islet hyperplasia and periductal lymphocytic inflammation when fed with a high fat obesogenic diet. Inflammatory infiltrates consist of TCRb+ Thy1+ T lymphocytes with increased levels of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Increased levels of inflammatory cells were coupled with elevated expression of cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 and IL1\u03b2. We conclude that FGF21 acts to limit islet hyperplasia and may also prevent pancreatic inflammation.",

The role of PTMs in regulating immune responses, specifically those mediated by dendritic cells (DCs), which are critical for both innate and adaptive immunity, is not well understood. Utilizing multiple but complementary approaches, we determined the role of an important but less understood type of PTM, namely, neddylation, in regulating DC functions. Inhibition of neddylation suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines by DCs in response to Toll-like receptor, nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor, and noninfectious CD40L stimulation. These effects were more profound than those mediated by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or a commonly used antiinflammatory agent, dexamethasone. Targeting neddylation also suppressed the ability of DCs to stimulate murine allogeneic T cells in vitro and in vivo and human allogeneic T-cell responses in vitro. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that inhibition of neddylation reduced both canonical and noncanonical nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity. Neddylation inhibition prevented the degradation of inhibitor-\u03baB and thus reduced the translocation and activation of NF-\u03baB, but without perturbation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Thus, blocking neddylation could be a novel strategy for mitigating immune-mediated disease processes.",

We previously identified specific genes in the cysteine protease and calcium-calmodulin pathways that regulated immune responses from dendritic cells (DCs). In this study we have characterized the role of neddylation in regulating various defense responses from DCs during mycobacterial infection. Neddylation is a process that is similar to ubiquitination. It however has its own enzyme machinery. It is coupled to ubiquitination and is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Here we show that stimulation of DCs with M. tb antigens Rv2463 and Rv3416 as well as infection with live M. tb modulates the expression levels of key proteins in the neddylation pathway. Further, stimulation with the two antigens promoted the association of NEDD8 with its target Cullin-1. The modulation in the expression levels of NEDD8 and SENtrin specific Protein 8 (SENP8) by the two antigens was in a calcium, MAPK and TLR dependent mechanism. Further, knockdown of specific genes of neddylation promoted the generation of oxidative burst, promoted phagolysosome fusion in mycobacteria infected DCs and induced higher expression of autophagy and apoptosis associated proteins in DCs. These results point toward a unique strategy employed by mycobacteria and its antigens towards immune suppression via modulating neddylation in DCs.",

Eukaryotic cells have developed complex DNA repair response (DDR) mechanisms to accurately sense and repair damaged DNA. Post-translational modifications by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, such as SUMO and NEDD8, have roles in coordinating the progression of DDR. Proteins in the neddylation pathway have also been linked to regulating DDR. Of interest is the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a multi-subunit metalloprotease present in eukaryotes that removes NEDD8 from cullins and regulates the activity of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). This in turn regulates the stability and turnover of a host of CRL-targeted proteins, some of which have established roles in DDR. This review will summarize the current knowledge on the role of the CSN and neddylation in DNA repair.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25655932": "Emerging evidence strongly supports a role for HDAC2 in the transcriptional regulation of endothelial genes and vascular function. We have recently demonstrated that HDAC2 reciprocally regulates the transcription of Arginase2, which is itself a critical modulator of endothelial function via eNOS. Moreover HDAC2 levels are decreased in response to the atherogenic stimulus OxLDL via a mechanism that is apparently dependent upon proteasomal degradation. NEDDylation is a post-translational protein modification that is tightly linked to ubiquitination and thereby protein degradation. We propose that changes in NEDDylation may modulate vascular endothelial function in part through alterations in the proteasomal degradation of HDAC2. In HAEC, OxLDL exposure augmented global protein NEDDylation. Pre-incubation of mouse aortic rings with the NEDDylation activating enzyme inhibitor, MLN4924, prevented OxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction. In HAEC, MLN enhanced HDAC2 abundance, decreased expression and activity of Arginase2, and blocked OxLDL-mediated reduction of HDAC2. Additionally, HDAC2 was shown to be a substrate for NEDD8 conjugation and this interaction was potentiated by OxLDL. Further, HDAC2 levels were reciprocally regulated by ectopic expression of NEDD8 and the de-NEDDylating enzyme SENP8. Our findings indicate that the observed improvement in endothelial dysfunction with inhibition of NEDDylation activating enzyme is likely due to an HDAC2-dependent decrease in Arginase2. NEDDylation activating enzyme may therefore be a novel target in endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis.",

Dysregulation in the ubiquitination and neddylation pathways is associated with many cancers. Ubiquitination involves covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, leading to protein degradation by the proteasome system. The activity of the E3-ubiquitin ligase family, cullin-RING ligases, is essential for promoting ubiquitin transfer to the appropriate substrates. Neddylation, a process mediated by the protein NEDD8, is required for conformational changes of cullins, a scaffolding protein situated in the core of cullin-RING ligases, and regulation of E3 ligase activity. In this review, we present a comprehensive discussion of the recent findings on the neddylation pathway and its importance during tumorigenesis. The ramifications regarding the potential therapeutic use of ubiquination and neddylation inhibition are also discussed.",

It is therefore essential to identify the molecular targets for the pathway. Until recently, the cullin family of proteins was characterized as the only substrates for NEDDylation. However, through either direct biological approaches or the use of proteomics, it is now evident that the NEDD8 proteome is more diverse than thought previously.

Similar to ubiquitination, neddylation is mediated by a cascade of three NEDD8 specific enzymes, an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme and one of the several E3 ligases. Neddylation is countered by the action of deneddylases via a process termed deneddylation. By altering the substrate's conformation, stability, subcellular localization or binding affinity to DNA or proteins, neddylation regulates diverse cellular processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated protein degradation, protein transcription, cell signaling etc. Dysregulation of neddylation has been linked to cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and more recently, cardiac disease. Here we comprehensively overview the biochemistry, the proteome and the biological function of neddylation. We also summarize the recent progress in revealing the physiological and pathological role of neddylation and deneddylation in the heart.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26260793": "Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that controls diverse biological processes by covalently conjugating the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to specific targets. Neddylation is commonly mediated by NEDD8-specific enzymes (typical neddylation) and, sometimes, by ubiquitin enzymes (atypical neddylation). Although typical neddylation is known to regulate protein function in many ways, the regulatory mechanisms and biological consequence of atypical neddylation remain largely unexplored. Here we report that NEDD8 conjugates were accumulated in the diseased hearts from mouse models and human patients. Proteotoxic stresses induced typical and atypical neddylation in cardiomyocytes. Loss of NUB1L exaggerated atypical neddylation, whereas NUB1L overexpression repressed atypical neddylation through promoting the degradation of NEDD8. Activation of atypical neddylation accumulated a surrogate misfolded protein, GFPu. In contrast, suppression of atypical neddylation by NUB1L overexpression enhanced GFPu degradation. Moreover, NUB1L depletion accumulated a cardiomyopathy-linked misfolded protein, CryAB(R120G), whereas NUB1L overexpression promoted its degradation through suppressing neddylation of ubiquitinated proteins in cardiomyocytes. Consequently, NUB1L protected cells from proteotoxic stress-induced cell injury. In summary, these data indicate that NUB1L suppresses atypical neddylation and promotes the degradation of misfolded proteins by the proteasome. Our findings also suggest that induction of NUB1L could potentially become a novel therapeutic strategy for diseases with increased proteotoxic stress.",

As a component of the E3 for neddylation, SCCRO/DCUN1D1 plays a key regulatory role in neddylation and, consequently, cullin-RING ligase activity. The essential contribution of SCCRO to neddylation is to promote nuclear translocation of the cullin-ROC1 complex. The presence of a myristoyl sequence in SCCRO3, one of four SCCRO paralogues present in humans that localizes to the membrane, raises questions about its function in neddylation. We found that although SCCRO3 binds to CAND1, cullins, and ROC1, it does not efficiently bind to Ubc12, promote cullin neddylation, or conform to the reaction processivity paradigms, suggesting that SCCRO3 does not have E3 activity. Expression of SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO-promoted neddylation by sequestering cullins to the membrane, thereby blocking its nuclear translocation. Moreover, SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO transforming activity. The inhibitory effects of SCCRO3 on SCCRO-promoted neddylation and transformation require both an intact myristoyl sequence and PONY domain, confirming that membrane localization and binding to cullins are required for in vivo functions. Taken together, our findings suggest that SCCRO3 functions as a tumor suppressor by antagonizing the neddylation activity of SCCRO.",

Here we report the development of DI-591 as a high-affinity, cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitor of the DCN1-UBC12 interaction. DI-591 binds to purified recombinant human DCN1 and DCN2 proteins with K <sub>i</sub> values of 10-12 nM, and disrupts the DCN1-UBC12 interaction in cells. Treatment with DI-591 selectively converts cellular cullin 3 into an un-neddylated inactive form with no or minimum effect on other cullin members.

However, it is unknown whether and how UBE2F, a less characterized neddylation E2, regulates lung cancer cell survival, and whether and how NOXA, a proapoptotic protein, is ubiquitylated and degraded by which E3 and via which ubiquitin linkage.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Methods of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were utilized to examine UBE2F protein expression. The biological functions of UBE2F were evaluated by <i>in vitro</i> cell culture and <i>in vivo</i> xenograft models. The <i>in vivo</i> complex formation among UBE2F-SAG-CUL5-NOXA was measured by a pulldown assay. Polyubiquitylation of NOXA was evaluated by <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> ubiquitylation assays.<b>Results:</b> UBE2F is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and predicts poor patient survival. While UBE2F overexpression promotes lung cancer growth both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, UBE2F knockdown selectively inhibits tumor growth. By promoting CUL5 neddylation, UBE2F/SAG/CUL5 tri-complex activates CRL5 (Cullin-RING-ligase-5) to ubiquitylate NOXA via a novel K11, but not K48, linkage for targeted proteasomal degradation. CRL5 inactivation or forced expression of K11R ubiquitin mutant caused NOXA accumulation to induce apoptosis, which is rescued by NOXA knockdown. Notably, NOXA knockdown rescues the UBE2F silencing effect, indicating a causal role of NOXA in this process. In lung cancer tissues, high levels of UBE2F and CUL5 correlate with a low level of NOXA and poor patient survival.<b>Conclusions:</b> By ubiquitylating and degrading NOXA through activating CRL5, UBE2F selectively promotes lung cancer cell survival and could, therefore, serve as a novel cancer target. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(4); 1104-16. \u00a92016 AACR</i>.",

This post-translational modification, neddylation, plays important roles in tumor cell proliferation and viability. Ubiquitin can form diverse polyubiquitin chains, on its seven lysines, which play important functions in various biological processes. However, the roles of lysines in NEDD8 have not been explored. Here, we generated nine NEDD8 point mutants, each with one lysine replaced by an arginine, to study the putative function of lysines in NEDD8. Our experiments discover that Lys27 in NEDD8 is a critical residue for protein neddylation. Replacement of this residue with arginine almost completely eliminates the conjugation of NEDD8 to its substrates. Furthermore, we find that the K27R mutant impairs NEDD8 conjugation to the E2 enzyme, which normally forms thioester bonds for further transferring NEDD8 to its ligases and substrates. Therefore, this mutation completely inhibits global protein neddylation, including neddylation of cullin family proteins, resulting in decreased activity of cullin-RING E3 ligases. This work sheds new light on the roles of NEDD8 lysines on neddylation cascades and provides a dominant negative mutant for the study of neddylation and its biological functions.",

This type of DSB break typically arises at collapsed replication forks or at eroded telomeres. BIR initiates by invasion of a broken DNA end into a homologous template followed by initiation of DNA synthesis that can proceed for hundreds of kilobases. This synthesis is drastically different from S-phase replication in that instead of a replication fork, BIR proceeds via a migrating bubble and is associated with conservative inheritance of newly synthesized DNA. This unusual mode of DNA replication is responsible for frequent genetic instabilities associated with BIR, including hyper-mutagenesis, which can lead to the formation of mutation clusters, extensive loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal translocations, copy-number variations and complex genomic rearrangements. In addition to budding yeast experimental systems that were initially employed to investigate eukaryotic BIR, recent studies in different organisms including humans, have provided multiple examples of BIR initiated within different cellular contexts, including collapsed replication fork and telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase. In addition, significant progress has been made towards understanding microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) that can promote complex chromosomal rearrangements, including those associated with cancer and those leading to a number of neurological disorders in humans.",

We used a murine BO model induced by heterotopic tracheal transplantation and assessed the origin of fibroblasts by using green fluorescent protein-BM chimeric mice. We also evaluated the effects of imatinib on luminal obstruction and fibrocyte accumulation. The effects of imatinib on fibrocyte migration and differentiation were assessed by culturing fibrocytes in vitro. In the murine BO model, tracheal allografts showed epithelial injury and developed complete luminal occlusion 28 days after transplantation. Most of the mesenchymal cells that had accumulated in the tracheal allograft were derived from BM cells. Imatinib treatment ameliorated the airway luminal occlusion and significantly reduced the number of fibrocytes in the allografts. In vitro studies showed that imatinib inhibited migration of cultured blood fibrocytes via the platelet-derived growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor receptor axis. Imatinib also inhibited differentiation of fibrocytes via suppression of c-Abl activity that was essential for the differentiation of monocytes to fibrocytes. Imatinib prevents airway luminal obstruction by inhibiting the migration and differentiation of fibrocytes. Fibrocytes may be a novel target in the prevention and treatment of BO.",

Blood and tissue fibrocytes were not increased compared to control subjects nor were blood fibrocytes associated with lung function or qCT, but were increased in eosinophilic COPD. Myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like fibrocytes were increased in COPD compared to controls [2.3 (1.1-4.9), P = 0.038]. Our path analysis model showed that collagen type 1 intensity for MDSC-like fibrocytes was positively associated with lung function through associations with air trapping, predominately in the upper lobes.

We show that the NPWT group exhibited 2.6-fold to 12.1-fold greater numbers of tail vein-injected PKH-26-labelled fibrocytes in the diabetic wound sites compared with the control group. We also demonstrate that the full-thickness skin wounds treated with NPWT exhibit significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression, blood vessel density and proliferating cells when exogenous fibrocyte mobilization is inhibited.

Numerous fibrocytes were found infiltrating the NEC intestinal mucous membranes. The percentage of fibrocytes to total leukocytes in the NEC inflammatory lesions was significantly increased compared with the percentage in the noninflammatory gastrointestinal tract. The fibrocyte attractant chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) was significantly increased in the plasma and was detectable in 80% of the peritoneal lavage fluid from NEC patients but not the controls. Furthermore, chemokine expression was increased in fibrocytes infiltrating and trafficking to leukocyte sites. In culture, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a significant increase in the expression of the Toll-like receptor (TLR4) signal, with the upregulation of p38 in both the isolated fibrocytes and macrophages. Similarly, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 induced increased the upregulation of the IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNAs but downregulated ColI in fibrocytes isolated from NEC patients compared with the controls.These findings indicate that circulating fibrocytes are increased in NEC patients and may be recruited to the inflammatory intestinal track, most likely through the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis.

The effects of nintedanib on the ability of fibrocytes to stimulate lung fibroblasts were examined in terms of their proliferation. The direct effects of nintedanib on the differentiation and migration of fibrocytes were also assessed. We investigated whether nintedanib affected the accumulation of fibrocytes in mouse lungs treated with bleomycin. Human fibrocytes produced PDGF, FGF2, and VEGF-A. Nintedanib and specific inhibitors for each growth factor receptor significantly inhibited the proliferation of lung fibroblasts stimulated by the supernatant of fibrocytes. Nintedanib inhibited the migration and differentiation of fibrocytes induced by growth factors in vitro. The number of fibrocytes in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model was reduced by the administration of nintedanib, and this was associated with anti-fibrotic effects. These results support the role of fibrocytes as producers of and responders to growth factors, and suggest that the anti-fibrotic effects of nintedanib are at least partly mediated by suppression of fibrocyte function.",

The present study was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition, overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3 expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy in cardiomyocytes by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3, which might provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the potential role of H19 in the pathogenesis of adriamycin-induced DCM. H19 knockdown in the myocardium of DCM rats attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved left ventricular structure and function. Adriamycin treatment was associated with elevated H19 and miR-675 expression and increased apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Enforced expression of miR-675 was found to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes with adriamycin treatment and H19-siRNA transfection. The 3'-untranslated region of PA2G4 was cloned downstream of a luciferase reporter construct and cotransfected into HEK293 cells with miR-675 mimic. The results of luciferase assay showed that PA2G4 was a direct target of miR-675. The expression of PA2G4 was reduced in cardiomyocytes transfected with miR-675 mimic. Moreover, H19 knockdown was found to increase PA2G4 expression and suppress apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to adriamycin. In conclusion, our study suggests that H19/miR-675 axis is involved in the promotion of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting PA2G4, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of adriamycin-induced DCM.",

At present, biological functions of H19 in cardiac differentiation is not completely clear. To explore the functional effect of H19 during cardiac differentiation. Expression levels of early cardiac-specific markers Nkx-2.5 and GATA4, cardiac contractile protein genes \u03b1-MHC and MLC-2v were determined by qRT-PCR and western lot. The levels of lncRNA H19 and miR-19b were detected by qRT-PCR. We further predicted the binding sequence of H19 and miR-19b by online softwares starBase v2.0 and TargetScan. The biological functions of H19 and Sox6 were evaluated by CCK-8 kit, cell cycle and apoptosis assay and caspase-3 activity. The expression levels of \u03b1-MHC, MLC-2v and H19 were upregulated, and miR-19b was downregulated significantly in mouse P19CL6 cells at the late stage of cardiac differentiation. Biological function analysis showed that knockdown of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis. H19 suppressed miR-19b expression and miR-19b targeted Sox6, which inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in P19CL6 cells during late-stage cardiac differentiation. Importantly, Sox6 overexpression could reverse the positive effects of H19 knockdown on P19CL6 cells. Downregulation of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis during late-stage cardiac differentiation by regulating the negative role of miR-19b in Sox6 expression, which suggested that the manipulation of H19 expression could serve as a potential strategy for heart disease.",

Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of NOTCH1, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as RUNX2 and BMP2. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern. Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to document the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to document the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve. We documented that lncRNA H19 (H19) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with H19 expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that H19 induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that H19 silenced NOTCH1 by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of H19 in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of NOTCH1 and decreased the level of RUNX2 and BMP2, 2 downstream targets repressed by NOTCH1. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented H19-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells. These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of H19 during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of NOTCH1.",

DUSP5 expression is regulated through epigenetic events involving LncRNA H19 human choriocarcinoma cell line. However, the molecular mechanisms of H19 modulating the DUSP5 expression in cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Here, we identify H19 negatively regulation of DUSP5 gene expression in cardiac fibroblast and fibrosis tissues. In vivo, the expression levels of H19, DUSP5, \u03b1-SMA, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in cardiac fibrosis tissue were estimated by Western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In vitro stimulation of freshly isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts with recombinant marine TGF-\u03b21 was performed, followed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to detect changes in H19, DUSP5, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 levels. Cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with pEX-3-H19 overexpressing, H19-RNAi down-regulating, or pEGFP-C1-DUSP5 overexpressing. Finally, cell proliferation was assessed by the MTT assay and cell cycle. H19 endogenous expression is overexpressed in cardiac fibroblast and fibrosis tissues, and an opposite pattern is observed for DUSP5. H19 ectopic overexpression reduces DUSP5 abundance and increases the proliferation of cardiac fibroblast, whereas H19 silencing causes the opposite effects. In a broader perspective, these results demonstrated that LncRNA H19 contributes to cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis, which act in part through repression of DUSP5/ERK1/2.",

For pharmacokinetic comparability, the final model was used to estimate exposure ratios (UTC/NCI) and associated 90 % confidence intervals (CIs) for area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum concentration (C max). All comparisons were based on a standardized single-dose regimen (17.5 mg/m(2) over 10 h). Final-model pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to previously published ch14.18-NCI parameters and comparable for UTC and NCI products. Products' systemic exposures were comparable, with 90 % CIs around ratios for AUCinf (0.96; 90 % CI 0.88-1.04) and C max (1.04; 90 % CI 0.98-1.11) within standard bioequivalence bounds (90 % CI 0.80-1.25).

TGFB1 and TGFBR1 mRNA expression was determined for 249 primary neuroblastoma tumors by microarray analysis. The ability of galunisertib to inhibit SMAD activity induced by neuroblastoma patient blood and bone marrow plasmas in neuroblastoma cells was tested. The impact of galunisertib on TGF\u03b21-induced inhibition of aNK cytotoxicity and ADCC in vitro and on anti-neuroblastoma activity in NOD-scid gamma (NSG) mice was determined. Neuroblastomas express TGFB1 and TGFBR1 mRNA.

ChIP-exo allows identification of a nearly complete set of the binding locations of DNA-binding proteins at near-single-nucleotide resolution with almost no background. The process is initiated by cross-linking DNA and associated proteins. Chromatin is then isolated from nuclei and subjected to sonication. Subsequently, an antibody against the desired protein is used to immunoprecipitate specific DNA-protein complexes. ChIP DNA is purified, sequencing adaptors are ligated, and the adaptor-ligated DNA is then digested by lambda exonuclease, generating 25- to 50-nucleotide fragments for high-throughput sequencing. The sequences of the fragments are mapped back to the reference genome to determine the binding locations.

It is thought that stalling of the mitochondrial replication machinery during DNA synthesis is a prominent source of mitochondrial genome instability; however, the precise molecular determinants of defective mitochondrial replication are not well understood. In this work, we performed a computational analysis of the human mitochondrial genome using the \"Pattern Finder\" G-quadruplex (G4) predictor algorithm to assess whether G4-forming sequences reside in close proximity (within 20 base pairs) to known mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints. We then used this information to map G4P sequences with deletions characteristic of representative mitochondrial genetic disorders and also those identified in various cancers and aging. Circular dichroism and UV spectral analysis demonstrated that mitochondrial G-rich sequences near deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplex DNA structures. A biochemical analysis of purified recombinant human Twinkle protein (gene product of c10orf2) showed that the mitochondrial replicative helicase inefficiently unwinds well characterized intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA substrates, as well as a unimolecular G4 substrate derived from a mitochondrial sequence that nests a deletion breakpoint described in human renal cell carcinoma. Although G4 has been implicated in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, our current findings suggest that mitochondrial G-quadruplexes are also likely to be a source of instability for the mitochondrial genome by perturbing the normal progression of the mitochondrial replication machinery, including DNA unwinding by Twinkle helicase.",

Currently, the multiple types of GQ sequences and their association with human mtDNA stability are unknown. Here, we show an association between human mtDNA deletion breakpoint locations (sites where DNA ends rejoin after deletion of a section) and sequences with G-quadruplex forming potential (QFP), and establish the ability of selected sequences to form GQ in vitro. QFP contain four runs of either two or three consecutive guanines (2G and 3G, respectively), and we identified four types of QFP for subsequent analysis: intrastrand 2G, intrastrand 3G, duplex derived interstrand (ddi) 2G, and ddi 3G QFP sequences. We analyzed the position of each motif set relative to either 5' or 3' unique mtDNA deletion breakpoints, and found that intrastrand QFP sequences, but not ddi QFP sequences, showed significant association with mtDNA deletion breakpoint locations. Moreover, a large proportion of these QFP sequences occur at smaller distances to breakpoints relative to distribution-matched controls. The positive association of 2G QFP sequences persisted when breakpoints were divided into clinical subgroups. We tested in vitro GQ formation of representative mtDNA sequences containing these 2G QFP sequences and detected robust GQ structures by UV-VIS and CD spectroscopy. Notably, the most frequent deletion breakpoints, including those of the \"common deletion\", are bounded by 2G QFP sequence motifs. The potential for GQ to influence mitochondrial genome stability supports a high-priority investigation of these structures and their regulation in normal and pathological mitochondrial biology. These findings emphasize the potential importance of helicases that subsequently resolve GQ to maintain the stability of the mitochondrial genome.",

CircRNAs are conserved across different species and display specific organization, sequence, and expression in disease. Moreover, circRNAs' closed ring structure, insensitivity to RNase, and stability are advantages over linear RNAs in terms of development and application as a new kind of clinical marker. In addition, according to recent studies, circular RNA-7 (ciRS-7) acts as a sponge of miR-7 and thus inhibits its activity. Numerous evidences have confirmed expression of miR-7 is dysregulated in cancer tissues, however, whether ciRS-7 invovled in oncogenesis by acting as sponge of miR-7 remains unclear. Most recently, a study reported ciRS-7 acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma through targeting miR-7 expression. This suggest ciRS-7/ miR-7 axis affects oncogenesis, and it provides a new perspective on the mechanisms of decreased miR-7 expression in cancer tissues. Discovery of sponge role of circRNAs caused researchers to more closely explore the underlying mechanism of carcinogenesis and has significant clinical implications, and may open a new chapter in research on the pathology and treatment of cancers. This review summarizes the structure and function of circRNAs and provides evidence for the impact of ciRS-7 in promoting the development of cancer by acting as sponge of miR-7.",

In the stomach, longstanding gastritis often results in structural alterations in the gastric mucosa, including metaplastic changes and gastric cancers. Therefore, it is important to elucidate factors that are involved in gastric inflammation. Nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase; Nrdc) is a metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family that promotes ectodomain shedding of the precursor forms of various growth factors and cytokines by enhancing the protease activities of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) proteins. Here, we have demonstrated that Nrdc crucially regulates gastric inflammation caused by Helicobacter felis infection or forced expression of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> in K19-C2mE mice. Metaplastic changes following gastric inflammation were suppressed by the deletion of Nrdc. Furthremore, the deletion of Nrdc significantly suppressed N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced gastric tumorigenesis in the murine stomach. These data may lead to a global therapeutic approach against various gastric disorders by targeting Nrdc.",

Several transcription factors enriched in \u03b2-cells, such as MafA, control \u03b2-cell function by organizing genes involved in GSIS. Here we demonstrate that nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase; Nrd1 and NRDc) critically regulates \u03b2-cell function through MafA. Nrd1(-/-) mice showed glucose intolerance and severely decreased GSIS. Islets isolated from Nrd1(-/-) mice exhibited reduced insulin content and impaired GSIS in vitro. Moreover, \u03b2-cell-specific NRDc-deficient (Nrd1(del\u03b2)) mice showed a diabetic phenotype with markedly reduced GSIS. MafA was specifically downregulated in islets from Nrd1(del\u03b2) mice, whereas overexpression of NRDc upregulated MafA and insulin expression in INS832/13 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that NRDc is associated with Islet-1 in the enhancer region of MafA, where NRDc controls the recruitment of Islet-1 and MafA transcription.

They are older than other asylum-seeking children and many come from countries with a high tuberculosis (TB) incidence. During the 2015 refugee crisis, 35,369 of 162,877 refugees (22%) seeking asylum in Sweden were unaccompanied minors, which gave us the opportunity to study their burden of TB infection and disease. Of the unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden during 2015, 2936 (8.3%) were allocated to northern Stockholm. Of these, 2422 were from countries with an incidence of TB exceeding 100/10<sup>5</sup>, and were screened for TB infection with a Mantoux tuberculin skin test or a QuantiFERON-TB Gold\u00ae. Those from countries with a lower TB incidence were screened only if they had other risk factors for TB exposure. Of those screened, 349 had a positive test and were referred to the northern paediatric TB clinic at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital. Of these, 16 had TB disease and 278 latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), while we considered 53 uninfected. In addition, eight sought medical attention with symptomatic TB outside the screening system. Cohort rates were 6.8% of LTBI and 0.5% of TB in minors from Afghanistan and 26-32% of LTBI and 3.4-3.5% of TB among those from Eritrea, Ethiopia or Somalia.

Therefore, TB screening in HCW is a useful prevention strategy in countries with both low and high TB incidence. Tuberculin skin test (TST) is widely used although it suffers of low specificity; on the contrary, the in vitro enzyme immunoassay tests (IGRA) show superior specificity and sensitivity but are more expensive. The present study reports the results of a three-year TB surveillance among HCW in a large teaching hospital in Rome, using TST (by standard Mantoux technique) and IGRA (by QuantiFERON-TB) as first- and second-level screening tests, respectively. Out of 2290 HCW enrolled, 141 (6.1%) had a positive TST; among them, 99 (70.2%) underwent the IGRA and 16 tested positive (16.1%). The frequency of HCW tested positive for TB seems not far from other experiences in low incidence countries. Our results confirm the higher specificity of IGRA, but, due to its higher cost, TST can be considered a good first level screening test, whose positive results should be further confirmed by IGRA before the patients undergo X-ray diagnosis and/or chemotherapy.",

However active, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key element in the public health response to tuberculosis and the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Different diagnostic methods for an assured diagnosis of TB are necessary. Chest radiography is a useful keystone to identify tuberculosis, but diagnosis of tuberculosis cannot be established by radiography alone. CT scanning is used in patients without pathological chest radiography but clinically suspected active TB and to differentiate TB from other diseases. Radiological appearance is primarily determined by the immune status of patients and caverns and disseminated disease foci are often observed. Laboratory diagnostic methods include microscopic identification of acid-fast mycobacteria from any body fluid (especially sputum), as well as isolation and characterisation of mycobacteria in culture. It is then possible to type the pathogens by the shape of their colony, their growth behavior and their biochemical characteristics. These methods are regarded as the gold standard in diagnosis of active TB. In patients who are highly suspected of having TB, but whose sputum specimens tested negative for mycobacteria, a nucleic acid amplification test is additionally performed. Moreover, sensitivity testing with first and second line antitubercular drugs is applied as standard. Laboratory diagnostic testing of cellular immunity against pathogenic mycobacteria employs the tuberculin skin test (TST, Mantoux tuberculin test) or the more specific interferon \u03b3 test to determine \u03b3 interferon released by T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro. The new ELISA and ELISPOT procedures exhibit higher test specificity and less cross reactivity to NTM (non-tuberculosis mycobacteria), are independent of BCG-vaccination status and correlate better with the degree of exposure than does the TST.",

Diaskintest\u00ae test and Mantoux test with 2TE PPD-L were concurrently carried out in 300 children and adolescents with tuberculosis and followed up in risk groups at a tuberculosis dispensary to determine the sensitivity of the new skin test in active tuberculosis infection. Diaskintest\u00ae showed a high sensitivity not only in active tuberculosis, but also in occult, the so-called latent, tuberculosis infection. This is suggested by the following evidence. The high percentage (83.8%) of positive responses to Diaskintest\u00ae is noted in children and adolescents with tuberculosis, receiving an intensive course of chemotherapy. Negative tests were observed only in minor forms at the resolution stage. In the children who had completed treatment, positive tests were seen in 78.3%, moreover in those with prior tuberculosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes; negative tests were observed not earlier than 18 months after start of treatment. The highest sensitivity of Diaskintest\u00ae was shown in children with early primary tuberculosis infection and through family contact with bacteria-excreting subjects (91.7%). These children may be judged with the highest assurance to have latent tuberculosis infection, the population of which is in an active state at the moment of the study. The children with early primary tuberculosis infection, but in no family contact with bacteria-excreting individuals, showed a lower percentage of positive responses to Diaskintest\u00ae both before (37.5%) and after (10%) treatment, which suggests that there must be a lower bacterial burden in the child. A high percentage of positive responses to Diaskintest\u00ae (76.2%) were found in subjects with hyperergic reactions to tuberculin. These were in only 16.7% in the group of patients receiving preventive therapy. In children and adolescents with a persistent positive Mantoux test (for more than 3 years), the response to Diaskintest\u00ae was negative in most cases since in early infection when mycobacteria propagated, the reaction to the drug was positive, but as 3 years pass the probability of the infection transition to the persistence stage is high--at that time the response to Diaskintest\u00ae becomes negative. Diaskintest\u00ae induces no delayed hypersensitivity associated with BCG vaccination, suggesting its high specificity. There were no positive reactions in patients with nonspecific lung diseases.",

In many developing countries, attempts to control the spread of infection rely solely on identification and treatment of those with active disease, ignoring subclinical infection. However, in developed countries, large efforts are also expended to identify and give prophylactic drugs to people with latent tuberculosis infection. Until recently, the 100-year-old tuberculin skin test (Mantoux) has been the only available diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection, despite its many well-known limitations. Advances in scientific knowledge have led to the development of tests for tuberculosis that measure the production of interferon-gamma by T-cells stimulated in vitro with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens. These interferon-gamma tests are highly specific and unaffected by prior Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination or immune reactivity to most atypical mycobacteria. They are more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in detecting people with active tuberculosis, and their results correlate more closely with M. tuberculosis exposure risk factors than the tuberculin skin test in people likely to have latent tuberculosis infection. Science has caught up with one of the oldest diagnostic tests still in use worldwide, and the adoption of new, tuberculosis-specific interferon-gamma-based tests should move us one step closer to better control of this insidious pathogen.",

Recent evidence from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) near the MMP12 gene at chromosome 11q22.3 were associated with large-vessel ischaemic stroke. Here, we evaluated and extended these results by examining the relationship between MMP12 and atherosclerosis in clinical and experimental studies. Plasma concentrations of MMP12 were measured at baseline in 3394 subjects with high-risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the Olink ProSeek CVD I array. The plasma MMP12 concentration showed association with incident cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (130 and 67 events, respectively, over 36 months) and carotid intima-media thickness progression (P = 3.6 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> ). A GWAS of plasma MMP12 concentrations revealed that SNPs rs499459, rs613084 and rs1892971 at chr11q22.3 were independently associated with plasma MMP12 (P &lt; 5 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup> ). The lead SNPs showed associations with mRNA levels of MMP12 and adjacent MMPs in atherosclerotic plaques. MMP12 transcriptomic and proteomic levels were strongly significantly increased in carotid plaques compared with control arterial tissue and in plaques from symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. By combining immunohistochemistry and proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that MMP12 localizes to CD68 + macrophages and interacts with elastin in plaques.

This new technology (Proseek<sup>\u00ae</sup> Multiplex Oncology Plates) can simultaneously measure the expression of 92 proteins in serum based on a proximity extension assay. We analyzed serum samples from 81 women representing healthy, benign pathology, early, and advanced stage serous ovarian cancer patients. Principle component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated patients into cancer versus non-cancer subgroups. Data from the Proseek<sup>\u00ae</sup> plate for CA125 levels exhibited a strong correlation with current clinical assays for CA125 (correlation coefficient of 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.93). CA125 and HE4 were present at very low levels in healthy controls and benign cases, while higher levels were found in early stage cases, with highest levels found in the advanced stage cases. Overall, significant trends were observed for 38 of the 92 proteins (p &lt; 0.001), many of which are novel candidate serum biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CA125 was 0.98 and the AUC for HE4 was 0.85 when comparing early stage ovarian cancer versus healthy controls. In total, 23 proteins had an estimated AUC of 0.7 or greater. Using a na\u00efve Bayes classifier that combined 12 proteins, we improved the sensitivity corresponding to 95% specificity from 93 to 95% when compared to CA125 alone.

In the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS; n = 931, 50% women, all aged 70 years), the number of carotid arteries with plaques was recorded by ultrasound. Levels of 82 proteins were assessed in plasma by a proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) and related to carotid measures in a regression framework. Following adjustment for multiple testing with Bonferroni correction, seven of the proteins were significantly related to the number of carotid arteries affected by plaques in sex-adjusted models (osteoprotegrin, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM)-1, growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), matrix metalloprotease-12 (MMP-12), renin, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) and growth hormone). Of these, renin (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.49 per standard deviation increase), growth hormone (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43), osteoprotegerin (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43) and TNFSF14 (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35) were related to plaque prevalence independently of each other and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. A novel targeted proteomics approach using the proximity extension technique discovered several new associations of candidate proteins with carotid artery plaque prevalence in a large human sample.",

Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), which may change the gut microbiota, is an effective anti-inflammatory treatment for Crohn's disease in children. We wanted to explore the immediate anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Thirteen patients with JIA (7-17 years of age), in a disease flare-up, were included in the study. Six children dropped out within 1.5-2.0 weeks of treatment, and seven patients continued, constituting the study cohort. EEN was given for three to eight weeks, with clinical and laboratory status assessed before and after treatment periods. In addition to conventional laboratory tests, 92 inflammatory proteins were analysed with a multiplex system (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I, Olink Bioscience). EEN had a significant anti-inflammatory effect on active joints (p=0.031), JADAS27 (p=0.016) and morning stiffness (p=0.031). In the multiplex analysis of inflammatory proteins, MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase), involved in the degradation of collagens in chondrocytes, decreased significantly (p=0.047), as did MCP-4 (p=0.031) and 4E-BP1 (p=0.031).

Despite clear improvement of the aHSCT outcome, substantial proportion of patients still suffers from severe complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The aim of this study was, therefore, to identify inflammation-associated molecules deregulated in the early serum samples of the patients after aHSCT and nominate markers associated with particular aHSCT parameters/complications. Serum concentrations of 92 inflammation-associated proteins were measured in samples obtained from 80 aHSCT patients 14 days after transplantation and from 23 healthy control subjects by a novel sensitive proximity extension assay technology using Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I kit. Serum profiles of inflammatory proteins in patients after aHSCT were substantially different from those observed in control subjects and related to underlying disease status before transplantation. Particularly, the difference between aHSCT patients and controls reached significance level for 57 analytes (40 upregulated, 17 downregulated in aHSCT patients). The concentration of several markers was associated with the level of donor/recipient HLA match (TGF-\u03b1: p <sub>corr</sub> = 0.025, HGF: p <sub>corr</sub> = 0.036) and with complete donor chimerism at day +30 after allografting (DNER: p <sub>corr</sub> = 0.042). None of the markers was significantly associated with acute and chronic GvHD after correction. More than half of investigated proteins significantly differed between the samples from aHSCT patients and healthy control subjects as a consequence of the \"cytokine storm\" after aHSCT. Comparisons of patient's subgroups based on specific biological/clinical parameters revealed much less evident differences; nevertheless, we nominated several markers associated with the level of donor/recipient HLA match and post-transplant chimerism.",

Laboratory analyses were performed by Proximity Extension Assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD I(96 \u00d7 96)), ELISAs and RT-PCR. Only circulating P-selectin correlated to the corresponding P-selectin gene expression in thrombi (r=0.530, p=0.002).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9744839": "A growing body of evidence, primarily from animal models of cerebral ischemia and preliminary human studies, indicates that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to secondary neuronal injury after acute cerebral ischemia. Ischemia followed by reperfusion rapidly leads to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, which stimulate a complex cascade of events involving local endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and perivascular cells. A secondary response includes the release of other cytokines, an increase in components of the coagulation system, an upregulation of cell adhesion molecule expression, and changes in the expression of components of the immune response. The net effect of these events is transformation of the local endothelium to a prothrombotic/proinflammatory state and induction of leukocyte migration to the site of injury. A number of studies have shown that leukocyte migration occurs within hours of reperfusion. Leukocytes accumulate in the injured region, where they cause tissue injury by several mechanisms, including occlusion of microvasculature, generation of oxygen free radicals, release of cytotoxic enzymes, alteration of vasomotor reactivity, and increase in cytokine and chemoattractant release. Monoclonal antibodies against leukocyte adhesion molecules have been shown to reduce infarct volume in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion. However, this treatment failed to show benefit in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial. A number of factors may complicate the use of antibody directed adhesion molecule blockade in acute stroke and will be discussed in this article. Overall, an increased understanding of inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms still offers great potential for reducing acute stroke injury.",

An open, uncontrolled, dose titration study was conducted in 32 patients hospitalized for stroke. Patients received one of four fixed dose regimens of enlimomab. A loading dose of enlimomab administered within 24 h of the onset of stroke symptoms was followed by four daily maintenance doses; total doses ranged from 140 to 480 mg. The pharmacokinetic target levels (enlimomab serum levels of &gt;/=10 microg/ml) were consistently achieved in all patients receiving dose regimens III and IV. Non-serious adverse events thought to be causally related to enlimomab administration included headache, vomiting and extrasystoles. Serious events occurred in 14 patients, including pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest. The only serious adverse event considered to be related to enlimomab administration was an anaphylactoid reaction, in a patient who received an unfiltered loading dose of antibody; the patient recovered. The overall mortality in the study was 15.6% and the 30-day mortality was 12.5%. There was no increase in the frequency of adverse events with increasing doses of enlimomab. Doses of enlimomab between 140 and 480 mg administered over 5 days did not increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke during an observation period of 30 +/- 10 days. A loading dose of 160 mg followed by four daily maintenance doses of 40 mg appears to be suitable for further study.",

We did a bedside-to-bench study in standardized rat stroke models to explore mechanisms for these untoward results. After focal brain ischemia in Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we administered murine anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody (1A29), subclass-matched murine immunoglobulin (IgG1), or vehicle intravenously. To examine whether rat anti-mouse antibodies were generated against the mouse protein and whether these were deleterious, we sensitized Wistar rats with 1A29 or vehicle 7 days before surgery. Infarct volume, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, neutrophil CD11b expression, and microvascular E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 expression were examined 48 hours after surgery. Complement activation was serially assessed for 2 hours after a single injection of either 1A29 or vehicle. 1A29 treatment did not significantly reduce infarct size in either strain. 1A29 sensitization augmented infarct size and generated rat anti-mouse antibodies. Although 1A29 inhibited neutrophil trafficking shown by reduction in brain myeloperoxidase activity, circulating neutrophils were activated and displayed CD11b upregulation. Complement was activated in 1A29-sensitized Wistar rats and 1A29-treated SHR. E-selectin (SHR), endothelial P-selectin (Wistar and SHR), and ICAM-1 (SHR) were upregulated in animals treated with 1A29. Administration to rats of a murine antibody preparation against ICAM-1, 1A29, elicits the production of host antibodies against the protein, activation of circulating neutrophils, complement activation, and sustained microvascular activation. These observations provide several possible mechanisms for central nervous system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when Enlimomab was given in acute ischemic stroke.",

Enlimomab, a murine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibody, reduces leukocyte adhesion and infarct size in experimental stroke studies. The purpose of the current clinical trial was to evaluate the use of enlimomab after ischemic stroke. A total of 625 patients with ischemic stroke were randomized to receive either enlimomab (n = 317) or placebo (n = 308) within 6 hours of stroke onset. Treatment was given over 5 days. Patients were evaluated at baseline and on days 5 and 90 after initiation of treatment; long-term assessments were carried out after 6 and 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the response to therapy at 90 days on the Modified Rankin Scale; other endpoints included Barthel Index (BI) and NIH Stroke Scale and survival. At day 90, the Modified Rankin Scale score was worse in patients treated with enlimomab than with placebo (p = 0.004). Fewer patients had symptom-free recovery on enlimomab than placebo (p = 0.004), and more died (22.2 versus 16.2%). The negative effect of enlimomab was apparent on days 5, 30, and 90 of treatment (p = 0.005). There were significantly more adverse events with enlimomab treatment than placebo, primarily infections and fever. Patients experiencing fever were more likely to have a poor outcome or die. The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome.",

Permanent MCAO results in a modest neutrophil infiltration at 24 h after ischaemia, predominantly around arterial vessels at the margins of infarction, whereas MCAO with subsequent reperfusion is associated with substantial infiltration by neutrophils throughout the entire infarct. Several studies show that C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, is associated with stroke outcomes and future vascular events. Several drugs, especially hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), have been demonstrated to reduce hsCRP levels independently of their effects on plasma cholesterol. Various cytokines were shown to be expressed in the injured brain. Recent investigations demonstrated that mRNAs of above cytokines were induced in the ischemic rat brain. TNF-alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates key roles in many physiological and pathological cellular processes including acute and chronic inflammation, programmed cell death or apoptosis, anti-tumor responses, and infection. Pharmaceutical industry to search a small molecule TNF inhibitor have taken multiple strategies. Significant protection after in vivo oral use of SB-239063 from brain injury and neurological deficits was observed in one study. In the same study significant protection from brain injury and neurological deficits was also demonstrated due to i.v post-stroke treatment with the same compound. Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion process consists of several steps, beginning with rolling of the leukocyte on the endothelial surface until it has slowed down to such a degree that it sticks to the endothelium. Treatment with a murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody (enlimomab) has been investigated in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial (EAST). Unfortunately, the case fatality rate in this trial was significantly higher in the enlimomab patient group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, experimental data have shown that focal cerebral ischemia induces a time-dependent activation of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Dissipation of ATP by CD39 reduced P2X7 receptor stimulation and thereby suppressed baseline leukocyte alphaMbeta2-integrin expression. As alphaMbeta2-integrin blockade reversed the postischemic, inflammatory phenotype of Cd39-/- mice, these data suggest that phosphohydrolytic activity on the leukocyte surface suppresses cell-cell interactions that would otherwise promote thrombosis or inflammation.",

In humans, although a recent trial International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) has shown that global recovery is similar in CDP-choline and placebo groups, CDP-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-PA. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial actions of CDP-choline. We have now studied the participation of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in the neuroprotective actions of CDP-choline. Fischer rats and Sirt1\u207b/\u207b mice were subjected to permanent focal ischemia. CDP-choline (0.2 or 2 g/kg), sirtinol (a SIRT1 inhibitor; 10 mg/kg), and resveratrol (a SIRT1 activator; 2.5 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally. Brains were removed 24 and 48 h after ischemia for western blot analysis and infarct volume determination. Treatment with CDP-choline increased SIRT1 protein levels in brain concomitantly to neuroprotection. Treatment with sirtinol blocked the reduction in infarct volume caused by CDP-choline, whereas resveratrol elicited a strong synergistic neuroprotective effect with CDP-choline. CDP-choline failed to reduce infarct volume in Sirt1\u207b/\u207b mice. Our present results demonstrate a robust effect of CDP-choline like SIRT1 activator by up-regulating its expression. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies to activate SIRT1 may be useful in the treatment of stroke. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is implicated in a wide range of cellular functions. Regarding stroke, there is no direct evidence. We have demonstrated that citicoline increases SIRT1 protein levels in brain concomitantly to neuroprotection.

As recombinant proteins are increasingly utilized as biotherapeutics, improved methodologies ensuring the characterization of post-translational modifications (PTMs) are needed. Typically, proteins prepared for PTM analysis are proteolytically digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry. To ensure full coverage of the PTMs on a given protein, one must obtain complete sequence coverage of the protein, which is often quite challenging. The objective of the research described here is to design a protocol that maximizes protein sequence coverage and enables detection of post-translational modifications, specifically N-linked glycosylation. To achieve this objective, a highly efficient proteolytic digest protocol using trypsin was designed by comparing the relative merits of denaturing agents (urea and Rapigest SF), reducing agents [dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phophine (TCEP)], and various concentrations of alkylating agent [iodoacetamide (IAM)]. After analysis of human apo-transferrin using various protease digestion protocols, ideal conditions were determined to contain 6 M urea for denaturation, 5 mM TCEP for reduction, 10 mM IAM for alkylation, and 10 mM DTT, to quench excess IAM before the addition of trypsin. This method was successfully applied to a novel recombinant protein, human lysyl oxidase-like 2. Furthermore, the glycosylation PTMs were readily detected at two glycosylation sites in the protein. These digestion conditions were specifically designed for PTM analysis of recombinant proteins and biotherapeutics, and the work described herein fills an unmet need in the growing field of biopharmaceutical analysis.",

Here, we assessed the extent of the post-translational modifications of hLOXL2 using truncated recombinant proteins produced in Drosophila S2 cells. The recombinant proteins are soluble, in contrast to LOX, which is consistently reported to require 2-6 m urea for solubilization. The recombinant proteins also show activity in tropoelastin oxidation. After phenylhydrazine derivatization and trypsin digestion, we used mass spectrometry to identify peptides containing the derivatized lysine tyrosylquinone cross-link at Lys-653 and Tyr-689, as well as N-linked glycans at Asn-455 and Asn-644. Disruption of N-glycosylation by site-directed mutagenesis or tunicamycin treatment completely inhibited secretion so that only small quantities of inclusion bodies were detected.

CFS/ME is a complex, multi-system, chronic medical condition whose pathophysiology remains unknown. No established diagnostic tests exist nor are any FDA-approved drugs available for treatment. Because of the range of symptoms of CFS/ME, treatment approaches vary widely. Studies undertaken have heterogeneous designs and are limited by sample size, length of follow-up, applicability and methodological quality. The use of rintatolimod and rituximab as well as counselling, behavioural and rehabilitation therapy programs may be of benefit for CFS/ME, but the evidence of their effectiveness is still limited. Similarly, adaptive pacing appears to offer some benefits, but the results are debatable: so is the use of nutritional supplements, which may be of value to CFS/ME patients with biochemically proven deficiencies. To summarize, the recommended treatment strategies should include proper administration of nutritional supplements in CFS/ME patients with demonstrated deficiencies and personalized pacing programs to relieve symptoms and improve performance of daily activities, but a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation is required to confirm these preliminary observations. At present, no firm conclusions can be drawn because the few RCTs undertaken to date have been small-scale, with a high risk of bias, and have used different case definitions. Further, RCTs are now urgently needed with rigorous experimental designs and appropriate data analysis, focusing particularly on the comparison of outcomes measures according to clinical presentation, patient characteristics, case criteria and degree of disability (i.e. severely ill ME cases or bedridden).",

In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors. However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype, whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24, mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed SNS mutator phenotype.",

Both substrates display significantly higher endogenous DNA content (average of 16.4% and 40.0% for teeth and petrous bones, respectively) than parietal skull bone (average of 2.2%). Despite sample-to-sample variation, petrous bone overall performs better than tooth cementum (p = 0.001). This difference, however, is driven largely by a cluster of viking skeletons from one particular locality, showing relatively poor molecular tooth preservation (&lt;10% endogenous DNA). In the remaining skeletons there is no systematic difference between the two substrates. A crude preservation (good/bad) applied to each sample prior to DNA-extraction predicted the above/below 10% endogenous DNA threshold in 80% of the cases. Interestingly, we observe signficantly higher levels of cytosine to thymine deamination damage and lower proportions of mitochondrial/nuclear DNA in petrous bone compared to tooth cementum.

Here, we describe a novel cranial base drilling method (CBDM) for accessing the osseous labyrinth from the cranial base that prevents damaging the surrounding cranial features, making it highly complementary to morphological analyses. We assessed this method by comparing the aDNA results from one petrous bone processed using our novel method to its pair, which was processed using established protocols for sampling disarticulated petrous bones. We show a decrease in endogenous DNA and molecular copy numbers when the drilling method is used; however, we also show that this method produces more endogenous DNA and higher copy numbers than any postcranial bone. Our results demonstrate that this minimally-invasive method reduces the loss of genetic data associated with the use of other skeletal elements and enables the combined craniometric and genetic study of individuals with archeological, cultural, and evolutionary value.",

The new samples include, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide ancient DNA from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, whose genetic material we obtained by extracting from petrous bones, and who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europe's first farmers.

Initially, little attention was paid to these intronic sequences, as they were considered not to contain regulatory information. However, advances in molecular biology, sequencing, and computational tools uncovered that numerous segments within these genomic elements do contribute to the regulation of gene expression. Introns are differentially removed in a cell type-specific manner to produce a range of alternatively-spliced transcripts, and many span tens to hundreds of kilobases. Recent work in human and fruitfly tissues revealed that long introns are extensively processed cotranscriptionally and in a stepwise manner, before their two flanking exons are spliced together. This process, called \"recursive splicing,\" often involves non-canonical splicing elements positioned deep within introns, and different mechanisms for its deployment have been proposed. Still, the very existence and widespread nature of recursive splicing offers a new regulatory layer in the transcript maturation pathway, which may also have implications in human disease.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25800735": "Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism present in eukaryotic cells to obtain a wide range of transcripts and protein isoforms from a relatively small number of genes. The mechanisms regulating (alternative) splicing and the paradigm of consecutive splicing have recently been challenged, especially for genes with a large number of introns. RNA-Seq, a powerful technology using deep sequencing in order to determine transcript structure and expression levels, is usually performed on mature mRNA, therefore not allowing detailed analysis of splicing progression. Sequencing pre-mRNA at different stages of splicing potentially provides insight into mRNA maturation. Although the number of tools that analyze total and cytoplasmic RNA in order to elucidate the transcriptome composition is rapidly growing, there are no tools specifically designed for the analysis of nuclear RNA (which contains mixtures of pre- and mature mRNA). We developed dedicated algorithms to investigate the splicing process. In this paper, we present a new classification of RNA-Seq reads based on three major stages of splicing: pre-, intermediate- and post-splicing. Applying this novel classification we demonstrate the possibility to analyze the order of splicing. Furthermore, we uncover the potential to investigate the multi-step nature of splicing, assessing various types of recursive splicing events. We provide the data that gives biological insight into the order of splicing, show that non-sequential splicing of certain introns is reproducible and coinciding in multiple cell lines. We validated our observations with independent experimental technologies and showed the reliability of our method.

Recursive splicing was first identified in the Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene and only three additional Drosophila genes have since been experimentally shown to undergo recursive splicing. Here we identify 197 zero nucleotide exon ratchet points in 130 introns of 115 Drosophila genes from total RNA sequencing data generated from developmental time points, dissected tissues and cultured cells. The sequential nature of recursive splicing was confirmed by identification of lariat introns generated by splicing to and from the ratchet points. We also show that recursive splicing is a constitutive process, that depletion of U2AF inhibits recursive splicing, and that the sequence and function of ratchet points are evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila. Finally, we identify four recursively spliced human genes, one of which is also recursively spliced in Drosophila. Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25970246": "It is generally believed that splicing removes introns as single units from precursor messenger RNA transcripts. However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing. The extent to which recursive splicing occurs in other species and its mechanistic basis have not been examined. Here we identify highly conserved RS-sites in genes expressed in the mammalian brain that encode proteins functioning in neuronal development. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates. We find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition of an 'RS-exon' that follows the RS-site. The RS-exon is then excluded from the dominant mRNA isoform owing to competition with a reconstituted 5' splice site formed at the RS-site after the first splicing step. Conversely, the RS-exon is included when preceded by cryptic promoters or exons that fail to reconstitute an efficient 5' splice site. Most RS-exons contain a premature stop codon such that their inclusion can decrease mRNA stability. Thus, by establishing a binary splicing switch, RS-sites demarcate different mRNA isoforms emerging from long genes by coupling cryptic elements with inclusion of RS-exons.",

These \"large introns\" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. In invertebrates, especially Drosophila, it has been shown that larger introns can be spliced efficiently through a process known as recursive splicing-a consecutive splicing from the 5'-end at a series of combined donor-acceptor splice sites called RP-sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing. We analyzed over 15,000 non-redundant, large introns from six mammals, 1,600 from chicken and zebrafish, and 560 non-redundant large introns from five invertebrates. Our bioinformatic investigation demonstrates that, unlike the studied invertebrates, the studied vertebrate genomes contain consistently abundant amounts of direct and complementary strand interspersed repetitive elements (mainly SINEs and LINEs) that may form stems with each other in large introns. This examination showed that predicted stems are indeed abundant and stable in the large introns of mammals. We hypothesize that such stems with long loops within large introns allow intron splice sites to find each other more quickly by folding the intronic RNA upon itself at smaller intervals and, thus, reducing the distance between donor and acceptor sites.",

We present bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and experimental evidence in Drosophila for a mechanism that subdivides many large introns by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements and alternative exons. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns &gt;20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns &lt;10 kb. The predicted sites in long introns are highly conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, despite extensive divergence of other sequences within the same introns. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Experimental analyses of in vivo processing intermediates and lariat products from four large introns in the unrelated genes kuzbanian, outspread, and Ultrabithorax confirmed that these introns are removed by a series of recursive splicing steps using the predicted nonexonic sites. Mutation of nonexonic site RP3 within Ultrabithorax also confirmed that recursive splicing is the predominant processing pathway even with a shortened version of the intron. We discuss currently known and potential roles for recursive splicing.",

RGS6 is a member of a subfamily of RGS proteins distinguished by the presence of DEP and GGL domains, the latter a G beta 5-interacting domain. Here we report identification of 36 distinct transcripts of human RGS6 that arise by unusually complex processing of the RGS6 gene, which spans 630 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA in human chromosome 14 and is interrupted by 19 introns. These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found. The role of structural diversity in the N-terminal and GGL domains of RGS6 splice variants in their interaction with G beta 5 and subcellular localization and of G beta 5 on RGS6 protein localization was examined in COS-7 cells expressing various RGS6 splice variant proteins. RGS6 splice variants with complete GGL domains interacted with G beta 5, irrespective of the type of N-terminal domain, while those lacking a complete GGL domain did not. RGS6 protein variants displayed subcellular distribution patterns ranging from an exclusive cytoplasmic to exclusive nuclear/nucleolar localization, and co-expression of G beta 5 promoted nuclear localization of RGS6 proteins. Analysis of our results show that the long N-terminal and GGL domain sequences of RGS6 proteins function as cytoplasmic retention sequences to prevent their nuclear/nucleolar accumulation. These findings provide the first evidence for G beta 5-independent functions of the GGL domain and for a role of G beta 5 in RGS protein localization. This study reveals extraordinary complexity in processing of the human RGS6 gene and provides new insights into how structural diversity in the RGS6 protein family is involved in their localization and likely function(s) in cells.",

The retained introns have common 5' splice site and different 3' splice sites. The detailed mechanism for the special alternative splicing remains largely unclear. In this study, we developed a minigene splicing system to recapitulate natural alternative splicing of the receptors and investigated the effects of 5' and 3' splice sites on intron retention in HeLa cells. Mutating weak 5' and 3' splice sites of the alternatively spliced introns toward the canonical consensus sequences promoted the splicing of the corresponding introns in rat and mouse minigenes. The effect of splice site strength was context-dependent and much more significant for the 3' splice site of the longer alternative intron than for the 3' splice site of the shorter alternative intron and the common 5' splice sites; it was also more significant in the rat minigene than in the mouse minigene. Mutating the 3' splice site of the longer alternative intron resulted in almost complete splicing of the intron and made the corresponding isoform to become the nearly exclusive transcript in the rat minigene.",

Here, we systematically investigated LOX/L expression in primary fibroblasts and epithelial cells under fibrotic conditions, Bleomycin (BLM) induced lung fibrosis and in human IPF tissue. Basal expression of all LOX/L family members was detected in epithelial cells and at higher levels in fibroblasts. Various pro-fibrotic stimuli broadly induced LOX/L expression in fibroblasts, whereas specific induction of LOXL2 and partially LOX was observed in epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissue from 14 IPF patients and healthy donors revealed strong induction of LOX and LOXL2 in bronchial and alveolar epithelium as well as fibroblastic foci. Using siRNA experiments we observed that LOXL2 and LOXL3 were crucial for fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). As FMT could only be reconstituted with an enzymatically active LOXL2 variant, we conclude that LOXL2 enzymatic function is crucial for fibroblast transdifferentiation. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the LOX/L family in fibrotic lung disease and indicates prominent roles for LOXL2/3 in fibroblast activation and LOX/LOXL2 in IPF.",

The distribution of selected components was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In bovine samples, the composition of the equatorial zonule was compared to that of the hyaloid zonule and vitreous humor.

Anti-LOXL2 antibody, control antilysyl oxidase antibody or placebo was administered during thioacetamide (TAA)-induced fibrosis progression or during recovery. Therapeutic efficacy in biliary fibrosis was tested in BALB/c.<i>Mdr2-/-</i> and 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-fed mice. Collagen crosslinking, fibrosis progression and reversal were assessed histologically and biochemically. HPC differentiation was studied in primary EpCAM(+) liver cells in vitro. LOXL2 was virtually absent from healthy but strongly induced in fibrotic liver, with predominant localisation within fibrotic septa. Delayed anti-LOXL2 treatment of active TAA fibrosis significantly reduced collagen crosslinking and histological signs of bridging fibrosis, with a 53% reduction in morphometric collagen deposition. In established TAA fibrosis, LOXL2 inhibition promoted fibrosis reversal, with enhanced splitting and thinning of fibrotic septa, and a 45% decrease in collagen area at 4 weeks of recovery. In the Mdr2-/- and DDC-induced models of biliary fibrosis, anti-LOXL2 antibody similarly achieved significant antifibrotic efficacy and suppressed the ductular reaction, while hepatocyte replication increased. Blocking LOXL2 had a profound direct effect on primary EpCAM(+) HPC behaviour in vitro, promoting their differentiation towards hepatocytes, while inhibiting ductal cell lineage commitment. LOXL2 mediates collagen crosslinking and fibrotic matrix stabilisation during liver fibrosis, and independently promotes fibrogenic HPC differentiation. By blocking these two convergent profibrotic pathways, therapeutic LOXL2 inhibition attenuates both parenchymal and biliary fibrosis and promotes fibrosis reversal.",

We focused on extracellular matrix proteins since these components play an important role in skin regeneration. As a model we analyzed the human dermal substitute denovoDerm and the dermo-epidermal skin substitute denovoSkin.

Metastatic lung cancer cells can undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by various transcription factors, including a double-negative feedback loop between the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and ZEB1, but the precise mechanisms by which ZEB1-dependent EMT promotes malignancy remain largely undefined. Although the cell-intrinsic effects of EMT are important for tumor progression, the reciprocal dynamic crosstalk between mesenchymal cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is equally critical in regulating invasion and metastasis. Investigating the collaborative effect of EMT and ECM in the metastatic process reveals increased collagen deposition in metastatic tumor tissues as a direct consequence of amplified collagen gene expression in ZEB1-activated mesenchymal lung cancer cells. In addition, collagen fibers in metastatic lung tumors exhibit greater linearity and organization as a result of collagen crosslinking by the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes. Expression of the LOX and LOXL2 isoforms is directly regulated by miR-200 and ZEB1, respectively, and their upregulation in metastatic tumors and mesenchymal cell lines is coordinated to that of collagen. Functionally, LOXL2, as opposed to LOX, is the principal isoform that crosslinks and stabilizes insoluble collagen deposition in tumor tissues. In turn, focal adhesion formation and FAK/SRC signaling is activated in mesenchymal tumor cells by crosslinked collagen in the ECM. Our study is the first to validate direct regulation of LOX and LOXL2 by the miR-200/ZEB1 axis, defines a novel mechanism driving tumor metastasis, delineates collagen as a prognostic marker, and identifies LOXL2 as a potential therapeutic target against tumor progression.",

The sternal ZipFix\u2122 (ZF) system consists of a biocompatible poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) cable-tie that surrounds the sternum through the intercostal space and provides a large implant-to-bone contact. Between 1 February 2011 and 31 January 2012, 680 cardiac operations were performed via sternotomy at our institution. After the exclusion of operations for active endocarditis and early mortality within 7 days, 95 patients were exclusively closed with ZF and could be compared with 498 who were closed with conventional wires (CWs) during the same period. A multivariable logistic regression analysis, including body mass index, renal impairment and emergency as suspected confounders and inverse propensity weights was performed on the infection rate. Total infection rate was 6.1%, with a total of 36 diagnosed sternal infections (5 in ZF and 31 in CW). Comparing ZF with CW with regard to sternal infection, there is no statistically significant difference related to the device (odds ratio: 0.067, confidence interval: 0.04-9.16, P=0.72). The propensity modelling provided excellent overlap and the mean propensity was almost the same in both groups. Thus, we have observed no difference in receiving either ZF or CW. No sternal instability was observed with the ZF device, unlike 4/31 patients in the CW group. The overall operation time is reduced by 11 min in the ZF group with identical perfusion and clamping times. Our study underlines a neutral effect of the sternal ZipFix\u2122 system in patients regarding sternal infection. Postoperative complications are similar in both sternal closure methods.

In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells 17\u03b2-oestradiol (E2)-bound oestrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2-upregulated coding genes. These induced eRNAs, as functional transcripts, seem to exert important roles for the observed ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, increasing the strength of specific enhancer-promoter looping initiated by ER-\u03b1 binding. Cohesin, present on many ER-\u03b1-regulated enhancers even before ligand treatment, apparently contributes to E2-dependent gene activation, at least in part by stabilizing E2/ER-\u03b1/eRNA-induced enhancer-promoter looping. Our data indicate that eRNAs are likely to have important functions in many regulated programs of gene transcription.",

The AR-regulated network is activated when AR binds enhancer elements and modulates specific enhancer-promoter looping. Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), which codes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a well-known AR-regulated gene and its upstream enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), termed KLK3e. Here, we demonstrate that KLK3e facilitates the spatial interaction of the KLK3 enhancer and the KLK2 promoter and enhances long-distance KLK2 transcriptional activation. KLK3e carries the core enhancer element derived from the androgen response element III (ARE III), which is required for the interaction of AR and Mediator 1 (Med1). Furthermore, we show that KLK3e processes RNA-dependent enhancer activity depending on the integrity of core enhancer elements.

Very recent evidence has indicted that some eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone \u03b1-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity. Knockdown of the more distal eRNA led to a drop in Cga mRNA levels, initially without effect on the forward eRNA levels. With time, however, the repression on the Cga increased, and the forward eRNA levels were suppressed also. We demonstrate that the interaction of the enhancer with the promoter is lost after eRNA knockdown. Dramatic changes also were seen in the chromatin, with an increase in total histone H3 occupancy throughout this region and a virtual loss of histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation at the promoter following the eRNA knockdown. Moreover, histone H3 Lys 27 (H3K27) acetylation, which was found at both enhancer and promoter in wild-type cells, appeared to have been replaced by H3K27 trimethylation at the enhancer. Thus, the Cga eRNA mediates the physical interaction between these genomic regions and determines the chromatin structure of the proximal promoter to allow gene expression.",

We used XR-seq to produce stranded, nucleotide-resolution maps of repair of two UV-induced DNA damages in human cells: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs]. In wild-type cells, CPD repair was highly associated with transcription, specifically with the template strand. Experiments in cells defective in either transcription-coupled excision repair or general excision repair isolated the contribution of each pathway to the overall repair pattern and showed that transcription-coupled repair of both photoproducts occurs exclusively on the template strand. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. XR-seq data also uncovered the repair characteristics and novel sequence preferences of CPDs and (6-4)PPs.

Using this approach, we have defined a class of primary transcripts (eRNAs) that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from estrogen receptor binding sites (ERBSs) with an average transcription unit length of \u223c3-5 kb. The majority are up-regulated by short treatments with estradiol (i.e., 10, 25, or 40 min) with kinetics that precede or match the induction of the target genes. The production of eRNAs at ERBSs is strongly correlated with the enrichment of a number of genomic features that are associated with enhancers (e.g., H3K4me1, H3K27ac, EP300/CREBBP, RNA polymerase II, open chromatin architecture), as well as enhancer looping to target gene promoters. In the absence of eRNA production, strong enrichment of these features is not observed, even though ESR1 binding is evident. We find that flavopiridol, a CDK9 inhibitor that blocks transcription elongation, inhibits eRNA production but does not affect other molecular indicators of enhancer activity, suggesting that eRNA production occurs after the assembly of active enhancers. Finally, we show that an enhancer transcription \"signature\" based on GRO-seq data can be used for de novo enhancer prediction across cell types.

Similarly, the surveillance systems that respond to such defects in higher eukaryotes are not clear.

However, when ribosomes translate an aberrant mRNA, they stall. Then, ribosomes are rescued from the aberrant mRNA, and the aberrant mRNA is subsequently degraded. In eukaryotes, Pelota (Dom34 in yeast) and Hbs1 are responsible for solving general problems of ribosomal stall in translation. In archaea, aPelota and aEF1\u03b1, homologous to Pelota and Hbs1, respectively, are considered to be involved in that process. In recent years, great progress has been made in determining structures of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1\u03b1. In this review, we focus on the functional roles of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1\u03b1 in ribosome rescue, based on recent structural studies of them.

In eukaryotes, the protein complex of Pelota (yeast Dom34) and Hbs1 translational GTPase recognizes the stalled ribosome containing the defective mRNA. Recently, we found that archaeal Pelota (aPelota) associates with archaeal elongation factor 1\u03b1 (aEF1\u03b1) to act in the mRNA surveillance pathway, which accounts for the lack of an Hbs1 ortholog in archaea. Here we present the complex structure of aPelota and GTP-bound aEF1\u03b1 determined at 2.3-\u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals how GTP-bound aEF1\u03b1 recognizes aPelota and how aPelota in turn stabilizes the GTP form of aEF1\u03b1. Combined with the functional analysis in yeast, the present results provide structural insights into the molecular interaction between eukaryotic Pelota and Hbs1. Strikingly, the aPelota\u00b7aEF1\u03b1 complex structurally resembles the tRNA\u00b7EF-Tu complex bound to the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the molecular mimicry of tRNA in the distorted \"A/T state\" conformation by Pelota enables the complex to efficiently detect and enter the empty A site of the stalled ribosome.",

CXCL7 exists as monomers and dimers, and dimerization (~50 \u03bcM) and CXCR2 binding (~10 nM) constants indicate that CXCL7 is a potent agonist as a monomer. Currently, nothing is known regarding the structural basis by which receptor and GAG interactions mediate CXCL7 function. Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we characterized the binding of CXCL7 monomer to the CXCR2 N-terminal domain (CXCR2Nd) that constitutes a critical docking site and to GAG heparin. We found that CXCR2Nd binds a hydrophobic groove and that ionic interactions also play a role in mediating binding. Heparin binds a set of contiguous basic residues indicating a prominent role for ionic interactions. Modeling studies reveal that the binding interface is dynamic and that GAG adopts different binding geometries. Most importantly, several residues involved in GAG binding are also involved in receptor interactions, suggesting that GAG-bound monomer cannot activate the receptor. Further, this is the first study that describes the structural basis of receptor and GAG interactions of a native monomer of the neutrophil-activating chemokine family.",

However, very little is known regarding heterodimer structural features and receptor and GAG interactions. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics characterization of platelet-derived chemokine CXCL7 heterodimerization with chemokines CXCL1, CXCL4, and CXCL8 indicated that packing interactions promote CXCL7-CXCL1 and CXCL7-CXCL4 heterodimers, and electrostatic repulsive interactions disfavor the CXCL7-CXCL8 heterodimer. As characterizing the native heterodimer is challenging due to interference from monomers and homodimers, we engineered a \"trapped\" disulfide-linked CXCL7-CXCL1 heterodimer. NMR and modeling studies indicated that GAG heparin binding to the heterodimer is distinctly different from the CXCL7 monomer and that the GAG-bound heterodimer is unlikely to bind the receptor. Interestingly, the trapped heterodimer was highly active in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release assay.

Simultaneous measurements of phagosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes and phagosome acidification in macrophages undergoing phagocytosis demonstrated that TRPM2 was required to mediate the efflux of cations and for phagosomal acidification during the process of phagosome maturation.

The transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing channel that is expressed in a number of inflammatory cells and therefore it has been suggested that inhibition of TRPM2 could lead to a beneficial effect in COPD patients. In this study, we have investigated the role of TRPM2 in a variety of mouse models of oxidative stress and COPD using TRPM2-deficent mice. Mice were exposed to ozone (3 ppm for 4 h) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg, intranasaly). In another model, mice were exposed to tobacco smoke (750 \u03bcg/l total wet particulate matter) for 30 min twice a day on three consecutive days. For the exacerbation model, the smoke exposure on the morning of day 3 animals was replaced with intranasal administration of LPS (0.3 mg/kg). Animals were killed 3 and 24 h after the challenge (ozone and LPS model) or 18 h after the last tobacco smoke exposure. In vitro neutrophil chemotaxis and monocyte activation were also studied using cells isolated from wild type and TRPM2-deficient animals. Statistical significance for the in vivo data (P &lt; 0.05) was determined using analysis of variance with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunns multiple comparison test. In all models studied, no difference in the bronchoalveolar lavage inflammation could be evidenced when comparing wild type and TRPM2-deficient mice. In addition, no difference could be seen in the lung inflammation as assessed by the measurement of various cytokines/chemokines. Similarly in various in vitro cellular activation assays using isolated neutrophils and monocytes no significant differences could be observed when comparing wild type and TRPM2-deficient mice. We have shown, in all the models tested, no difference in the development of airway inflammation or cell activation between TRPM2-deficient mice and their wild type counterparts.

Mucosal mast cells (MMCs) play a particularly important role in FA, and the increase in their cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]cyt) is considered to be a principal component of the degranulation process. However, the mechanisms governing Ca(2+) influx remain poorly understood in MMCs. Recent reports have highlighted the functions of the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel in immunocytes, including its role in monocyte chemokine production and macrophage phagocytic activity. Although TRPM2 gene expression has been demonstrated in mast cells, the significance of such expression remains virtually unknown. In this study, we found that antigen-stimulated degranulation was significantly reduced in mucosal-type bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMCs) prepared from TRPM2-knockout (TRPM2-KO) mice (TRPM2-KO mBMMCs) and was suppressed following the administration of three TRPM2 inhibitors with different chemical structures, including econazole, flufenamic acid (FFA), and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. Furthermore, the antigen-stimulated increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt was significantly decreased in TRPM2-KO mBMMCs and was also suppressed by the TRPM2 inhibitors econazole and FFA. In addition, thapsigargin-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt was significantly decreased in TRPM2-KO mBMMCs. These results suggest that TRPM2 may participate in antigen-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx and subsequent degranulation. In addition, TRPM2 inhibitors were shown to improve food allergic reactions in a mouse model. Together, these results suggest that TRPM2 inhibitors suppress MMC degranulation via regulation of the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt.

Since the mechanisms that lead to TRPM2 gating in response to ADPR and H(2)O(2) are not understood in neuronal cells, I summarized previous findings and important recent advances in the understanding of Ca(2+) influx via TRPM2 channels in different neuronal cell types and disease processes. Considering that TRPM2 is activated by oxidative stress, mediated cell death and inflammation, and is highly expressed in brain, the channel has been investigated in the context of central nervous system. TRPM2 plays a role in H(2)O(2) and amyloid \u03b2-peptide induced striatal cell death. Genetic variants of the TRPM2 gene confer a risk of developing Western Pacific amyotropic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia complex and bipolar disorders. TRPM2 also contributes to traumatic brain injury processes such as oxidative stress, inflammation and neuronal death. There are a limited number of TRPM2 channel blockers and they seem to be cell specific. For example, ADPR-induced Ca(2+) influx in rat hippocampal cells was not blocked by N-(p-amylcinnomoyl)anthralic acid (ACA), the IP(3) receptor inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate or PLC inhibitor flufenamic acid (FFA). However, the Ca(2+) entry in rat primary striatal cells was blocked by ACA and FFA. In conclusion TRPM2 channels in neuronal cells can be gated by either ADPR or H(2)O(2). It seems to that the exact relationship between TRPM2 channels activation and neuronal cell death still remains to be determined.",

These alterations of the extracellular milieu change the activity of transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily member 2 (TRPM2), a nonselective cation channel expressed in the central nervous system and the immune system. Our goal was to evaluate the contribution of TRPM2 to the tissue damage after stroke. In accordance with current quality guidelines, we independently characterized Trpm2 in a murine ischemic stroke model in 2 different laboratories. Gene deficiency of Trpm2 resulted in significantly improved neurological outcome and decreased infarct size. Besides an already known moderate neuroprotective effect of Trpm2 deficiency in vitro, ischemic brain invasion by neutrophils and macrophages was particularly reduced in Trpm2-deficient mice. Bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that Trpm2 deficiency in the peripheral immune system is responsible for the protective phenotype. Furthermore, experiments with mixed bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that Trpm2 is essential for the migration of neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, also of macrophages into ischemic hemispheres. Notably, the pharmacological TRPM2 inhibitor, N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid, was equally protective in the stroke model. Although a neuroprotective effect of TRPM2 in vitro is well known, we can show for the first time that the detrimental role of TRPM2 in stroke primarily depends on its role in activating peripheral immune cells.

Although DS is mostly perceived as affecting cognitive abilities and cardiac health, individuals with DS also exhibit dysregulated immune functions. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased, but intrinsic alterations of innate immunity are understudied in DS. Furthermore, elevated Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are well documented in individuals with DS, further exacerbating inflammatory processes. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are often precursors of subsequent tissue destruction and pathologies, which affect a majority of persons with DS. Together with ROS, the second messenger ion Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a central role in immune regulation. TRPM2 (Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ion channel that is activated under conditions of oxidative stress.

We therefore used Lm infection to trigger and characterize immune responsiveness in the DS mouse model Dp10(yey), and to investigate the potential contribution of TRPM2. In comparison to wildtype (WT), Dp10(yey) mice show an increased resistance against Lm infection and higher IFN\u03b3 serum concentrations. Using a gene elimination approach, we show that these effects correlate with Trpm2 gene copy number, supporting the notion that Trpm2 might promote hyperinflammation in DS.",

Therefore, we investigated the expression of TRPM2 channels and their involvement in visceral nociception in normal physiology and under pathological conditions that cause visceral hypersensitivity in rats. TRPM2 immunoreactivities were detected in the mucosa and muscle layer of the rat gastrointestinal tract. TRPM2 immunopositive cell bodies were almost completely co-localized with calretinin- and NeuN-positive cells in the myenteric plexus. We found that the majority of the TRPM2-immunoreactive cells were double-labeled with the retrograde marker fluorogold in lumbar 6/sacral 1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG), indicating that TRPM2 is expressed in spinal primary afferents innervating the distal colon. Subtypes of TRPM2-immunopositive DRG neurons were labeled by the A-fiber marker NF200, the C-fiber marker IB<sub>4</sub>, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or P2X3 receptor. We found that oral administration of the TRPM2 inhibitor econazole (30mg/kg) reduced the visceromotor response (VMR) to noxious colorectal distention (CRD) at 80mmHg in control rats. Expression of TRPM2 in the mucosa of the distal colon was increased in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis model. The VMR to CRD significantly increased in colitis model rats compared with control rats at 40, 60, and 80mmHg. Econazole restored visceral hypersensitivity to the control level. Furthermore, TRPM2-deficient mice showed significantly attenuated trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced visceral hypersensitivity compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, TRPM2 channels contribute to visceral nociception in response to noxious stimuli under normal conditions and visceral hypersensitivity in pathological conditions.",

Here, we describe the computational identification of a melanoma-enriched antisense transcript, TRPM2-AS, mapped within the locus of TRPM2, an ion channel capable of mediating susceptibility to cell death. Analysis of the TRPM2-AS genomic region indicated the presence in the same region of another tumor-enriched TRPM2 transcript, TRPM2-TE, located across a CpG island shared with TRPM2-AS. Quantitative PCR experiments confirmed that TRPM2-AS and TRPM2-TE transcripts were up-regulated in melanoma, and their activation was consistent with the methylation status of the shared CpG island. Functional knock-out of TRPM2-TE, as well as over-expression of wild-type TRPM2, increased melanoma susceptibility to apoptosis and necrosis. Finally, expression analysis in other cancer types indicated that TRPM2-AS and TRPM2-TE over-expression might have an even wider role than anticipated, reinforcing the relevance of our computational approach in identifying new potential therapeutic targets.",

Multiple studies relate these effects to increased oxidative stress and aberrant activity of calcium-permeable cation channels leading to calcium imbalance. The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel activated by oxidative stress, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and more recently in amyloid-induced toxicity. Here we show that the function of TRPM2 is augmented by treatment of cultured neurons with \u03b2-amyloid oligomers. Aged APP/PS1 Alzheimer's mouse model showed increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, protein disulfide isomerase and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1, as well as decreased levels of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. Elimination of TRPM2 in APP/PS1 mice corrected these abnormal responses without affecting plaque burden. These effects of TRPM2 seem to be selective for \u03b2-amyloid toxicity, as ER stress responses to thapsigargin or tunicamycin in TRPM2(-/-) neurons was identical to that of wild-type neurons. Moreover, reduced microglial activation was observed in TRPM2(-/-)/APP/PS1 hippocampus compared with APP/PS1 mice. In addition, age-dependent spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice were reversed in TRPM2(-/-)/APP/PS1 mice. These results reveal the importance of TRPM2 for \u03b2-amyloid neuronal toxicity, suggesting that TRPM2 activity could be potentially targeted to improve outcomes in Alzheimer's disease. Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing calcium-permeable channel that is thought to contribute to calcium dysregulation associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that oligomeric \u03b2-amyloid, the toxic peptide in Alzheimer's disease, facilitates TRPM2 channel activation. In mice designed to model Alzheimer's disease, genetic elimination of TRPM2 normalized deficits in synaptic markers in aged mice. Moreover, the absence of TRPM2 improved age-dependent spatial memory deficits observed in Alzheimer's mice.

Depletion of cellular GSH is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and thereby contributes to the associated oxidative stress and Ca2+ dysregulation. Whether depletion of cellular GSH, associated with neuronal senescence, directly influences Ca2+ permeation pathways is not known. Transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel expressed in several cell types including hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, activation of TRPM2 during oxidative stress has been linked to cell death. Importantly, GSH has been reported to inhibit TRPM2 channels, suggesting they may directly contribute to Ca2+ dysregulation associated with neuronal senescence. Herein, we explore the relation between cellular GSH and TRPM2 channel activity in long-term cultures of hippocampal neurons. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observe that TRPM2 current density increases in cultured pyramidal neurons over time in vitro. The observed increase in current density was prevented by treatment with NAC, a precursor to GSH synthesis. Conversely, treatment of cultures maintained for 2 weeks in vitro with L-BSO, which depletes GSH by inhibiting its synthesis, augments TRPM2 currents. Additionally, we demonstrate that GSH inhibits TRPM2 currents through a thiol-independent mechanism, and produces a 3.5-fold shift in the dose-response curve generated by ADPR, the intracellular agonist for TRPM2. These results indicate that GSH plays a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of TRPM2 currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

Starting from 100 oocytes collected via a novel serum-free hanging drop culture system, we identified 2,154 proteins, whose function indicate that oocytes are largely resting cells with a proteome that is tailored for homeostasis, cellular attachment, and interaction with its environment via secretory factors. In addition, we have identified 158 oocyte-enriched proteins (such as ECAT1, PIWIL3, NLRP7)(1) not observed in high-coverage proteomics studies of other human cell lines or tissues.

Despite great progress in proteomics technologies, thorough interrogation of the proteome from quantity-limited biological samples is hampered by inefficiencies during processing. To address these challenges, here we introduce a novel protocol using paramagnetic beads, termed Single-Pot Solid-Phase-enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3). SP3 provides a rapid and unbiased means of proteomic sample preparation in a single tube that facilitates ultrasensitive analysis by outperforming existing protocols in terms of efficiency, scalability, speed, throughput, and flexibility. To illustrate these benefits, characterization of 1,000 HeLa cells and single Drosophila embryos is used to establish that SP3 provides an enhanced platform for profiling proteomes derived from sub-microgram amounts of material. These data present a first view of developmental stage-specific proteome dynamics in Drosophila at a single-embryo resolution, permitting characterization of inter-individual expression variation. Together, the findings of this work position SP3 as a superior protocol that facilitates exciting new directions in multiple areas of proteomics ranging from developmental biology to clinical applications.",

Here we present a framework for inferring cancer-related gene overexpression resulting from CRE reorganization (e.g., enhancer hijacking) by integrating SCNAs, gene expression data and information on topologically associating domains (TADs). Analysis of 7,416 cancer genomes uncovered several pan-cancer candidate genes, including IRS4, SMARCA1 and TERT. We demonstrate that IRS4 overexpression in lung cancer is associated with recurrent deletions in cis, and we present evidence supporting a tumor-promoting role. We additionally pursued cancer-type-specific analyses and uncovered IGF2 as a target for enhancer hijacking in colorectal cancer. Recurrent tandem duplications intersecting with a TAD boundary mediate de novo formation of a 3D contact domain comprising IGF2 and a lineage-specific super-enhancer, resulting in high-level gene activation. Our framework enables systematic inference of CRE rearrangements mediating dysregulation in cancer.",

Previous studies have been unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes that operate in medulloblastoma subgroups. Here we analyse the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity among 1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify subgroup-specific driver alterations that include previously undiscovered actionable targets. Driver mutations were confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous knowledge. New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and 'enhancer hijacking' events that activate PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an extensive cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer entity revealed a series of cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with medulloblastoma.",

Importantly, such variants could affect enhancer regulation by changing transcription factor bindings or enhancer hijacking, and in turn, make an essential contribution to disease progression. To facilitate better usage of published data and exploring enhancer deregulation in various human diseases, we created DiseaseEnhancer (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/DiseaseEnhancer/), a manually curated database for disease-associated enhancers. As of July 2017, DiseaseEnhancer includes 847 disease-associated enhancers in 143 human diseases. Database features include basic enhancer information (i.e. genomic location and target genes); disease types; associated variants on the enhancer and their mediated phenotypes (i.e. gain/loss of enhancer and the alterations of transcription factor bindings). We also include a feature on our website to export any query results into a file and download the full database. DiseaseEnhancer provides a promising avenue for researchers to facilitate the understanding of enhancer deregulation in disease pathogenesis, and identify new biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapy.",

We used a novel approach called \"pinpointing enhancer-associated rearrangements by chromatin immunoprecipitation,\" or PEAR-ChIP, to simultaneously map enhancer activity and proximal rearrangements in lymphoma cell lines and patient biopsies. This method detects rearrangements involving known cancer genes, including CCND1, BCL2, MYC, PDCD1LG2, NOTCH1, CIITA, and SGK1, as well as novel enhancer duplication events of likely oncogenic significance. We identify lymphoma subtype-specific enhancers in the MYC locus that are silenced in lymphomas with MYC-activating rearrangements and are associated with germline polymorphisms that alter lymphoma risk. We show that BCL6-locus enhancers are acetylated by the BCL6-activating transcription factor MEF2B, and can undergo genomic duplication, or target the MYC promoter for activation in the context of a \"pseudo-double-hit\" t(3;8)(q27;q24) rearrangement linking the BCL6 and MYC loci. Our work provides novel insights regarding enhancer-driven oncogene activation in lymphoma. We demonstrate a novel approach for simultaneous detection of genomic rearrangements and enhancer activity in tumor biopsies. We identify novel mechanisms of enhancer-driven regulation of the oncogenes MYC and BCL6, and show that the BCL6 locus can serve as an enhancer donor in an \"enhancer hijacking\" translocation.",

In most cases, onychomycosis is associated with limited treatment options that are effective in achieving complete clearance in many cases. In addition, recurrence rates are high in the subset of treated patients who have been effectively cleared, usually with an oral antifungal agent. There has been a conspicuous absence of medical therapies approved in the United States since the introduction of topical ciclopirox (8% nail lacquer), with no new effective agents introduced for more than 10 years. Fortunately, newer agents and formulations have been under formal development. While patients might prefer a topical therapy, efficacy with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, the only available agent until the very recent approval of efinaconazole 10% solution, has been disappointing. The poor therapeutic outcomes achieved with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer were not unexpected as the cure rates achieved in the clinical trials were unimpressive, despite concomitant nail debridement, which was an integral part of the pivotal trials with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer. Efinaconazole 10% solution and tavaborole 5% solution are new topical antifungals specifically developed for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis. In Phase 3 clinical trials, both newer agents were applied once daily for 48 weeks without concomitant nail debridement. Mycologic cure rates with efinaconazole 10% solution are markedly superior to what was achieved with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer. To add, they appear to be nearly comparable to those achieved with oral itraconazole in pivotal clinical trials. However, it is important to remember that direct comparisons between different studies are not conclusive, are not generally considered to be scientifically sound, and may not be entirely accurate due to differences in study design and other factors. Well-designed and properly powered head-to-head studies are needed in order to draw definitive conclusions about efficacy comparisons between therapies, at least based on academic and regulatory standards. Although tavaborole 5% solution is in an earlier phase of development for onychomycosis, treatment success rates reported thus far for both efinaconazole 10% solution and tavaborole 5% solution are superior to ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer. As a result, a new era of onychomycosis appears to be upon us that incorporates topical therapy more effectively than in the past. Not only may these newer topical agents provide viable monotherapy alternatives to oral therapy for onychomycosis, topical therapy for onychomycosis that is effective, well tolerated, and easy to use may also find a role in combination therapy, and/or as continued therapy after initial clearance to reduce recurrence or re-infection.",

Although dermatological complaints are frequent among Olympians, there is a scarcity of literature that reviews sports-related dermatoses among Olympic athletes. A comprehensive review of PREMEDLINE and MEDLINE searches of all available literature through to January 2011 was conducted, focusing on sports-related dermatological presentations as well as the key words 'Olympic athletes' and 'skin diseases'. Common skin conditions can be harmful and even prohibitive for competition. Common aetiologies of dermatological conditions related to sports include: skin infections with dermatophytes such as tinea pedis and tinea corporis, bacteria such as pitted keratolysis, and folliculitis and viruses such as herpes gladiatorum. Frictional dermatoses occur commonly and include athlete's nodules, jogger's itch, frictional blisters, callosities and talon noir. Trauma can cause haematomas such as auricular haematomas. Due to long training hours in the sun, many endurance athletes experience high levels of UV radiation and a higher risk for both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Pre-existing dermatoses can also be aggravated with practice and competition; in particular, atopic eczema and physical urticarias. Infrequent dermatoses are susceptible to misdiagnosis, delay in treatment and needless biopsies. This review highlights the diagnosis and management of sports-related dermatoses by the following general categories of Olympic sport: endurance, resistance, team sport, and performing arts.",

These infections include tinea capitis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea manuum and tinea barbae. Tinea versicolor, caused by Malassezia furfur, and candidal infections are also common. Treatment modalities include oral and topical agents. Good personal hygiene is an important adjunct to antifungal therapy. Decisions regarding the appropriateness of therapy in a given patient must take into account the extent and location of the infection, the benefits and risks of each of the treatments, and cost.

It is thought that humoral and cell-mediated immunities play a role in the formation of the clinical types of the disease. We studied twelve patients with acute inflammatory disease, four patients with chronic non-inflammatory disease, and one patient with a black-dot variant of tinea capitis. The composition of inflammatory infiltrates present in lesional skin was analyzed by antibodies to T cells (CD3) and B cells (CD20). Anti-CD3 revealed large numbers of T cells in twelve patients with acute, inflammatory dermatophytosis, whereas anti-CD20 revealed marked infiltrates of both B and T cells in all patients with chronic, non-inflammatory dermatophytosis.

The genus Trichophyton gives rise to most of the tinea dermatophytoses, including tinea capitis, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (onychomycosis). Part of the diagnostic challenge lies in distinguishing the mycotic lesions from those caused by cutaneous diseases such as psoriasis, eczema, dyshidrosis, and contact dermatitis. Because environmental conditions play a major role in fungal infection onset, clinical management should include patient education about conditions conducive to fungal propagation.

These workers are exposed to numerous occupational and environmental risk factors that can result in skin disease. Few data exist on the prevalence of skin disease in this population. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and predictors of skin disease in a sample of Latino farmworkers in North Carolina. A sample of 59 farmworkers was recruited and interviewed at two camps during the 2004 agricultural season. A dermatologist completed a skin exam of each worker and recorded any skin disease present. Forty-two (77.7%) of the 54 men, and all five of the women examined had a diagnosed skin disease. For the men, onychomycosis (nail fungus, 31.5%), tinea pedis (foot fungus, 27.8%), and acne (24.1 %) were the most commonly diagnosed skin diseases, with contact dermatitis diagnosed in 5.6% of the sample. Other diagnoses included scars, sunburn, and atopic dermatitis. Among the women, diagnoses included melasma (dark patches on the face, 2 cases), xerosis (excessively dry skin, 1 case), tinea pedis (2 cases), onychomycosis (1 case), acne (1 case), and insect bites (1 case).

On the contrary, tinea corporis and cruris showed a remarkable decreasing tendency. Patient age distribution of each disease also showed distinctive changes, generally increasing in the older generation and decreasing in the younger. The number of patients with tinea pedis and unguium gradually increased among the middle and older generations, with the peak of the age-distribution curve shifting upward year after year. On the other hand, cases of tinea cruris among the younger generation were few in the latest years, and middle-age patients remained at a low number. In the first stage of this study the kinds of atiologic dermatophytes consisted of multiple species, but after middle period the isolation of Epidermaphyton floccosum decreased. Microsporum canis appeared first in 1976 but in the recent several years has completely disappeared. In the last few years of the period studied Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes were the only isolates found from among all types of dermatophytoses. Infantile candidiasis remarkably increased in 1970-1975 but thereafter decreased rapidlly. Candidial intertrigo also increased in the same period but did not decrease as much thereafter and continued at the same intermediate level. The number of other types of candidiases were not greatly changed throughout the 30-year period.

The practicing allergist may be called upon to treat this disease for various reasons. Sometimes tinea infection may be mistaken for atopic dermatitis or allergic eczema. In other patients, tinea pedis may complicate allergy and asthma and may contribute to refractory atopic disease. Patients with recurrent cellulitis may be referred to the allergist/immunologist for an immune evaluation and discovered to have tinea pedis as a predisposing factor. From a molecular standpoint, superficial fungal infections may induce a type2 T helper cell response (Th2) that can aggravate atopy. Th2 cytokines may induce eosinophil recruitment and immunoglobulin E (IgE) class switching by B cells, thereby leading to exacerbation of atopic conditions. Three groups of fungal pathogens, referred to as dermatophytes, have been shown to cause tinea pedis: Trychophyton sp, Epidermophyton sp, and Microsporum sp. The disease manifests as a pruritic, erythematous, scaly eruption on the foot and depending on its location, three variants have been described: interdigital type, moccasin type, and vesiculobullous type. Tinea pedis may be associated with recurrent cellulitis, as the fungal pathogens provide a portal for bacterial invasion of subcutaneous tissues. In some cases of refractory asthma, treatment of the associated tinea pedis infection may induce remission in airway disease. Very often, protracted topical and/or oral antifungal agents are required to treat this often frustrating and morbid disease.

The most common infections in prepubertal children are tinea corporis and tinea capitis, whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to develop tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (onychomycosis). The clinical diagnosis can be unreliable because tinea infections have many mimics, which can manifest identical lesions. For example, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, tinea capitis can be confused with alopecia areata, and onychomycosis can be confused with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma. Physicians should confirm suspected onychomycosis and tinea capitis with a potassium hydroxide preparation or culture. Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical agents such as terbinafine cream or butenafine cream, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for extensive disease, failed topical treatment, immunocompromised patients, or severe moccasin-type tinea pedis. Oral terbinafine is first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because of its tolerability, high cure rate, and low cost.

Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify the predicted exons of all chromosome 4 genes, and homozygous embryos for each deficiency were identified and their DNA used to test for the presence or absence of these exons. By testing for the inability to amplify various exons along the length of the chromosome, we were able to determine which predicted genes are missing in each deficiency. The five deficiencies, Df(4)G, Df(4)C3, Df(4)C1-10AT, and Df(4)B2-20 (all terminal deletions), and Df(4)M101-62f (a proximal interstitial deletion), enabled us to partition the gene-containing, right arm of chromosome 4 into five regions. Region A [uncovered by Df(4)M101-62f] contains the proximal-most 21 genes; region B [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D] contains the next 12 genes; region C [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D and Df(4)C1-10AT] contains the next 17 genes; region D [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, and Df(4)C3] contains the next 21 genes; and region E [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, Df(4)C3, and Df(4)G] contains the distal-most ten genes. By using Df(4)M101-62f, Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, Df(4)C3, and Df(4)G in complementation tests, we can assign newly induced recessive lethal mutations to one of the five regions on chromosome 4.

On initial screening of Japanese patients with AR-JP, we had found that approximately half of the parkin mutations are deletions occurring between exons 2 and 5, forming a deletion hot spot. In this study, we investigated the deletion breakpoints of the parkin mutations in 22 families with AR-JP and examined the possible association between these deletion events and meiotic recombinations. We identified 18 deletion breakpoints at the DNA nucleotide sequence level. Almost all these deletions were different, indicating that the deletion hot spot was generated by recurrent but independent events. We found no association between the deletions and specific DNA elements. Recent copy number variation (CNV) data from various ethnic groups showed that the deletion hot spot is overlapped by a highly polymorphic CNV region, indicating that the recurrent deletion mutation or CNV is observable worldwide. By comparing Marshfield and deCODE linkage maps, we found that the parkin deletion hot spot may be associated with a meiotic recombination hot spot, although such association was not found on comparison with recent high-resolution genetic maps generated from the International HapMap project. Here, we discuss the possible mechanisms for deletion hot spot formation and its effects on human genomes.",

Hemizygotic deletions or duplications in the large Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD gene responsible for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are routinely identified using multiple ligation probe amplification and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. These methods only map deleted or duplicated exons, without providing the exact location of breakpoints. Commonly used methods for the detection of CNV breakpoints include long-range PCR and primer walking, their success being limited by the deletion size, GC content and presence of DNA repeats. Here, we present a strategy for detecting the breakpoints of medium and large CNVs regardless of their size. The hemizygous deletion of exons 45-50 in the DMD gene and the large autosomal heterozygous PARK2 deletion were used to demonstrate the workflow that relies on real-time quantitative PCR to narrow down the deletion region and Sanger sequencing for breakpoint confirmation. The strategy is fast, reliable and cost-efficient, making it amenable to widespread use in genetic laboratories.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084947": "Gross chromosomal rearrangements (including translocations, deletions, insertions and duplications) are a hallmark of cancer genomes and often create oncogenic fusion genes. An obligate step in the generation of such gross rearrangements is the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Since the genomic distribution of rearrangement breakpoints is non-random, intrinsic cellular factors may predispose certain genomic regions to breakage. Notably, certain DNA sequences with the potential to fold into secondary structures [potential non-B DNA structures (PONDS); e.g. triplexes, quadruplexes, hairpin/cruciforms, Z-DNA and single-stranded looped-out structures with implications in DNA replication and transcription] can stimulate the formation of DNA DSBs. Here, we tested the postulate that these DNA sequences might be found at, or in close proximity to, rearrangement breakpoints. By analyzing the distribution of PONDS-forming sequences within \u00b1500 bases of 19 947 translocation and 46 365 sequence-characterized deletion breakpoints in cancer genomes, we find significant association between PONDS-forming repeats and cancer breakpoints. Specifically, (AT)n, (GAA)n and (GAAA)n constitute the most frequent repeats at translocation breakpoints, whereas A-tracts occur preferentially at deletion breakpoints. Translocation breakpoints near PONDS-forming repeats also recur in different individuals and patient tumor samples. Hence, PONDS-forming sequences represent an intrinsic risk factor for genomic rearrangements in cancer genomes.",

We have tested the possibility of further increasing this resolution using PCR fragments generated from individual BAC clones. Using this approach, we have efficiently defined the proximal and distal breakpoints in two cytogenetic cases, one duplication and one deletion, to within 5-20 kb.

All three deletions are the result of non-homologous recombinations. A fourth mutation, a duplication of exons 2 and 3, is the result of an Alu-mediated homologous recombination between identical 19bp sequences in introns 3 and 1. In toto, two of three germinal HPRT duplication mutations appear to have been caused by Alu-mediated homologous recombination, while only one of six deletion mutations appears to have resulted from this type of recombination mechanism. The other five deletion mutations resulted from non-homologous recombination. With this admittedly limited number of characterized macro-mutations, Alu-mediated unequal homologous recombinations account for at least 8% (3 of 38) of the macro-alterations and 1% (3 of 271) of the total HPRT germinal mutations.",

Genetic linkage mapping studies initially identified linkage between the disease and the microsatellite marker C04107. Subsequently, the deletion of exon 2 of the copper metabolism domain containing 1 (COMMD1) gene (formerly MURR1) was shown to be the major cause of copper toxicosis, although the deletion breakpoints were not defined. In this investigation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and sequencing were used to isolate the deletion breakpoints, utilizing the newly available dog genome sequence. The breakpoints were positioned at 65.3091 and 65.3489 Mb of dog chromosome 10, in intron 1 and intron 2 of COMMD1 respectively, a deletion of 39.7 kb. The two breakpoints share sequence homology suggesting that homologous recombination may have been responsible for the deletion. Using this information, a genomic diagnostic test for the COMMD1 deletion was developed and compared with microsatellite C04107 genotypes of 40 Bedlington terriers. Results from the 40 samples showed allele 2 of C04107 to be in linkage disequilibrium with the COMMD1 deletion.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17351135": "Genomic disorders contribute significantly to genetic disease and, as detection methods improve, greater numbers are being defined. Paralogous low copy repeats (LCRs) mediate many of the chromosomal rearrangements that underlie these disorders, predisposing chromosomes to recombination errors. Deletions of proximal 22q11.2 comprise the most frequently occurring microdeletion syndrome, DiGeorge/Velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS), in which most breakpoints have been localized to a 3 Mb region containing four large LCRs. Immediately distal to this region, there are another four related but smaller LCRs that have not been characterized extensively. We used paralog-specific primers and long-range PCR to clone, sequence, and examine the distal deletion breakpoints from two patients with de novo deletions mapping to these distal LCRs. Our results present definitive evidence of the direct involvement of LCRs in 22q11 deletions and map both breakpoints to the BCRL module, common to most 22q11 LCRs, suggesting a potential region for LCR-mediated rearrangement both in the distal LCRs and in the DGS interval. These are the first reported cases of distal 22q11 deletions in which breakpoints have been characterized at the nucleotide level within LCRs, confirming that distal 22q11 LCRs can and do mediate rearrangements leading to genomic disorders.",

In Southeast Asians and Taiwanese, this mutation is the second most common long-segment deletion of two alpha-globin genes, after the Southeast Asian deletion. To define the Thailand deletion breakpoints, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the normal-sequence DNA fragments across the breakpoints. The amplified products were sequenced directly or after cloning into pGem-3Z or pCR2.1 vectors. Comparison of the normal and mutant sequences revealed that the 5' breakpoint lies between nucleotides 1,269 and 1,290 upstream of the initiator codon adenine of the zeta2-globin gene, and the 3' breakpoint lies between nucleotides 29,387 and 29,408 downstream of it. A total of 30,677 nucleotides were deleted. Both breakpoints mentioned above lie within the Alu repetitive sequences and an extensive sequence homology is present around the two breakpoints. These findings suggest that homologous recombination is the mechanism by which the deletion occurs. Based on our data, we used three oligonucleotide primers to amplify the regions across the deletion and its corresponding normal sequence. The feasibility of PCR diagnosis was confirmed in 20 carriers with this deletion.",

As many lncRNAs regulate nuclear events and thus must localize to nuclei, we analyzed the sequence requirements for nuclear localization in an intergenic lncRNA named BORG (BMP2-OP1-responsive gene), which is both spliced and polyadenylated but is strictly localized in nuclei. Subcellular localization of BORG was not dependent on the context or level of its expression or decay but rather depended on the sequence of the mature, spliced transcript. Mutational analyses indicated that nuclear localization of BORG was mediated through a novel RNA motif consisting of the pentamer sequence AGCCC with sequence restrictions at positions -8 (T or A) and -3 (G or C) relative to the first nucleotide of the pentamer. Mutation of the motif to a scrambled sequence resulted in complete loss of nuclear localization, while addition of even a single copy of the motif to a cytoplasmically localized RNA was sufficient to impart nuclear localization. Further, the presence of this motif in other cellular RNAs showed a direct correlation with nuclear localization, suggesting that the motif may act as a general nuclear localization signal for cellular RNAs.",

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology has significantly advanced our understanding of this structure-to-function relationship. However, all 3C-based methods rely on chemical cross-linking to stabilize spatial interactions. This step remains a \"black box\" as regards the biases it may introduce, and some discrepancies between microscopy and 3C studies have now been reported. To address these concerns, we developed \"i3C\", a novel approach for capturing spatial interactions without a need for cross-linking. We apply i3C to intact nuclei of living cells and exploit native forces that stabilize chromatin folding. Using different cell types and loci, computational modeling, and a methylation-based orthogonal validation method, \"TALE-iD\", we show that native interactions resemble cross-linked ones, but display improved signal-to-noise ratios and are more focal on regulatory elements and CTCF sites, while strictly abiding to topologically associating domain restrictions.",

It is characterised by focal areas of increased and disorganised bone turnover, coupled with increased bone formation. This disease usually appears in the late stages of life, being slightly more frequent in men than in women. It has been reported worldwide, but primarily affects individuals of British descent. Majority of PDB patients are asymptomatic, but clinical manifestations include pain, bone deformity and complications, like pathological fractures and deafness. The causes of the disease are poorly understood and it is considered as a complex trait, combining genetic predisposition with environmental factors. Linkage analysis identified <i>SQSTM1</i>, at chromosome 5q35, as directly related to the disease. A number of mutations in this gene have been reported, pP392L being the most common variant among different populations. Most of these variants affect the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of the protein, which is involved in autophagy processes. Genome-wide association studies enlarged the number of loci associated with PDB, and further fine-mapping studies, combined with functional analysis, identified <i>OPTN</i> and <i>RIN3</i> as causal genes for Paget's disease. A combination of risk alleles identified by genome-wide association studies led to the development of a score to predict disease severity, which could improve the management of the disease. Further studies need to be conducted to elucidate other important aspects of the trait, such as its focal nature and the epidemiological changes found in some populations. In this review, we summarize the clinical characteristics of the disease and the latest genetic advances to identify susceptibility genes.

The condition is characterized by increased bone cell activity, with bone-resorbing osteoclasts often larger and containing more nuclei than normal, and osteoblasts producing increased amounts of disorganized bone. This leads to expanded bone of poor quality possessing both sclerotic and lytic areas. PD of bone has a strong genetic element, with a family history being noted in 10-20% of cases. A number of genetic defects have been found to be associated with the condition. The most common disease-associated variants identified affect the SQSTM1 gene, providing insights into disease aetiology, with the clinical value of knowledge of SQSTM1 mutation status currently under active investigation. The diagnosis may be suggested by an isolated raised total ALP without other identifiable causes. This can be confirmed on plain X-rays and the extent determined by isotope bone scan. The mainstays of treatment are the bisphosphonates, especially i.v. zoledronate, which results in long-term suppression of bone turnover.

However, true esophageal Paget disease (intraepithelial growth of neoplastic cells with glandular differentiation) has only rarely been reported. We encountered 3 endoscopic biopsy specimens containing Paget cells in squamous epithelium associated with adenocarcinomas in Barrett esophagus (BE) and in the esophagogastric junction. To determine the prevalence of Paget cells in the esophagus, we studied 81 endoscopic mucosal resections and 27 esophagectomies from patients with invasive or intramucosal adenocarcinoma, and compared the findings to a control group of 47 endoscopic mucosal resections and 25 esophagectomies from patients with high-grade dysplasia in BE. Paget cells were present in squamous epithelium overlying 5 (4.9%) of 108 adenocarcinomas but in none (0%) of 72 BE with high-grade dysplasia (P=0.16). A computerized search for primary Paget disease using the terms \"Paget's and esophagus\" or \"pagetoid and esophagus\" from 1994 to 2007 did not yield any additional cases. Among the 8 patients with Paget cells (including the 2 index biopsies) there were no differences in either sex distribution (7M:1F) or age (mean 62.4 y) as compared with 103 adenocarcinomas without Paget cells (93M:10F, P=0.58; mean age 69.2 y, P=0.78). Morphologically, all adenocarcinomas with Paget cells contained at least a component of diffuse, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and 1 was a signet ring cell carcinoma. Paget cells involved only squamous epithelium directly above the poorly differentiated tumor foci. Histochemistry for periodic acid-Schiff with diastase (PAS-D) and mucicarmine, and immunohistochemistry for CK7, CK20, p53, and E-cadherin, were performed on 7 Paget cases with the following results: PAS-D+ (7 of 7, 100%), mucicarmine+ (6 of 7, 86%), CK7+ (7 of 7, 100%), CK20+ (5 of 7, 71%), p53 overexpression (3 of 7, 43%), and E-cadherin loss (complete loss in 1 and faint expression in 3, 57%). Overall, PAS-D was the most efficacious stain for highlighting Paget cells. A control group of 19 adenocarcinomas without Paget cells were also stained for E-cadherin; only 1 showed faint expression (5%) and none showed complete loss (P=0.01). These results demonstrate a low but significant prevalence (4.9%) of Paget cells in esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas. Unlike previously described cases of mammary, vulvar, and perianal Paget disease, esophageal Paget cells are almost universally associated with underlying adenocarcinoma and not with high grade dysplasia (\"in situ\" disease) or primary Paget disease. A commonality among cases with Paget cells is the presence of focal or diffuse, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with discohesive cells. E-cadherin alterations seem to play a less significant role.",

There are abnormalities in the stages of osteoclast development, and studies in Paget's disease have suggested a major role for IL-6 in human osteoclast activity. The pathophysiologic basis for these abnormalities is not clearly defined, except that the primary cellular abnormality resides in the osteoclast. Many important questions about the pathophysiology of Paget's disease still remain to be answered, including: (1) What is the identity of the virus in pagetic osteoclasts?; (2) Are Paget's patients in different geographical locales harboring a similar virus in their osteoclasts, or can different paramyxoviruses induce Paget's disease?; (3) How is the virus maintained and propagated for many years, so that it can be expressed in the osteoclast, a cell with a finite lifespan?; and (4) Since Paget's disease has a very high familial tendency, with up to 40% of patients having an affected relative, what is the genetic locus associated with Paget's disease, and does this genotype result in an increased propensity for hematopoietic cells such as the osteoclast to harbor paramyxoviruses?

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2660231": "Paget's disease of bone is characterized by the progressive and extensive replacement, in one or several bones, of normal bone tissue by a bone tissue of rough and irregular structure, the excessive and disorderly renewal of which gradually produces hyperdensity and hypertrophy of the bones involved. The condition results from the action of abnormal and overactive osteoclasts containing virus-like intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The disease profoundly alters the physiology of bones in the region affected. The viral-looking inclusions that enter the osteoclasts seem to induce a loss of control of bone renewal and remodelling, as shown by histology and radiology. The resorption-formation mechanism persists but it is unbalanced, facilitating bone resorption during two to five years, then bone formation. In that way, subjects with Paget's disease, who have reached the age of physiological osteopenia, show an often important increase in bone density and mass. Paget's disease of bone is a disease grafted on the skeleton: it is partly dependent on the skeletal status of the host. The activity of Paget's disease is evaluated by measuring the ratio of plasma alkaline phosphatase levels to the volumes of normal and pagetic bones; the author suggests a mathematical formula for calculating this ratio.",

Our aim was to examine the presence of these molecules in Paget's disease of the vulva and Paget's disease of the breast, and to correlate any differences in their expression with the presence of invasive disease or an underlying carcinoma. Sixty-three archival cases of Paget's disease of the vulva, including eight associated with invasive disease, and 23 archival cases of Paget's disease of breast, which included 10 cases with ductal carcinoma in situ alone, four cases with both ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma, and five cases with underlying invasive carcinoma alone, were analysed immunohistochemically for expression of E-cadherin, plakoglobin and beta-catenin proteins. The respective mRNAs were also detected by in situ hybridisation using digoxigenin-labelled cRNA probes. Seventy-six percent (41/54) of Paget's disease of vulva cases had &gt;50% of Paget cells expressing the E-cadherin protein, compared with 28 % (2/7) of Paget's disease vulva with invasive disease.

However, vulvar Paget disease is in itself a heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplasms that can be similar both clinically and histopathologically. The subtypes of vulvar Paget disease include primary Paget disease arising from a pluripotent stem cell within the epithelium of the vulva, and secondary Paget disease of the vulva. Secondary vulvar Paget disease results from spread of an internal malignancy, most commonly from an anorectal adenocarcinoma or urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or urethra, to the vulvar epithelium. We have recently proposed that these lesions be classified as primary (of cutaneous origin) or secondary (of extracutaneous origin). These subtypes can present similarly as eczematoid skin lesions and may appear similar on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Immunohistochemical studies can help differentiate between them. Our current study includes 17 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of vulvar Paget disease. We performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains, including cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), and uroplakin-III (UP-III). Of these 17 patients, 14 (80%) had primary intraepithelial cutaneous Paget disease, 13 without invasion and 1 with associated invasion. Three patients had urothelial carcinoma with spread to the vulva, manifesting as secondary vulvar Paget disease. Immunohistochemically, primary vulvar Paget disease is immunoreactive for CK 7 and GCDFP-15, but uncommonly for CK 20. Vulvar Paget disease secondary to anorectal carcinoma demonstrates CK 20 immunoreactivity but is usually nonreactive for CK 7 and consistently nonimmunoreactive for GCDFP-15. Vulvar Paget disease secondary to urothelial carcinoma is immunoreactive for CK 7 and CK 20 but nonimmunoreactive for GCDFP-15. In addition, we propose the use of a new, commercially available antibody, UP-III, which is specific for urothelium and, in our experience, is immunoreactive in secondary vulvar Paget disease of urothelial origin. The distinction between these 3 types of Paget and Paget-like lesions is essential in that the specific diagnosis has a significant influence on current treatment. The difference in surgical approach to the subtypes of vulvar Paget disease justifies classifying them into distinct lesions, which may be aided by the use of immunohistochemistry, including UP-III.",

The epidermotropic theory holds that Paget's cells are ductal carcinoma cells that have migrated from the underlying breast parenchyma to the nipple epidermis. According to the in situ transformation theory, the Paget's cells arise as malignant cells in the nipple epidermis independent from any other pathologic process within the breast parenchyma. This theory has been proposed to explain those cases in which there is no underlying mammary carcinoma or when there is a carcinoma remote from the nipple-areola complex. Each of these theories is plausible; however, treatment approaches differ markedly depending on the theory of histogenesis. Mastectomy has been considered the standard of care in the management of patients with Paget's disease of the breast. Nowadays, however, some patients with Paget's disease of the breast are candidates for breast-conserving therapy. Patients must be selected carefully on an individual basis. Until there is a better understanding of the relationship of Paget's disease of the breast to the underlying cancer the surgeon should understand the natural history and behaviour of this lesion and be aware of both the risks of under- and over-treating patients with Paget's disease of the breast.",

To gain structural and mechanistic insights to aid the design of new inhibitors, we have determined the crystal structure of OXA-13 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the apo form and in complex with the carbapenem meropenem. The native form consisted of a dimer displaying an overall organisation similar to that found in the closely related enzyme OXA-10. In the acyl-enzyme complex, the positioning of the antibiotic appeared to be ensured mainly by (i) the covalent acyl bond and (ii) a strong salt-bridge involving the carboxylate moiety of the drug. Comparison of the structures of OXA-13 in the apo form and in complex with meropenem revealed an unsuspected flexibility in the region of the essential serine 115 residue, with possible consequences for the catalytic properties of the enzyme. In the apo form, the Ser115 side-chain is oriented outside the active site, whereas the general base Lys70 adopts a conformation that seems to be incompatible with the activation of the catalytic water molecule required for the deacylation step. In the OXA-13:meropenem complex, a 3.5 A movement of the backbone of the 114-116 loop towards the side-chain of Lys70 was observed, which seems to be driven by a displacement of the neighbouring 91-104 loop and which results in the repositioning of the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser115 toward the catalytic centre. Concomitantly, the side-chain of Lys70 is forced to curve in the direction of the deacylating water molecule, which is then strongly bound and activated by this residue. However, a distance of ca 5 A separates the catalytic water molecule from the acyl carbonyl group of meropenem, a structural feature that accounts for the inhibition of OXA-13 by this drug. Finally, the low level of penicillinase activity revealed by the kinetic analysis of OXA-13 could be related to the specific presence in position 73 of a serine residue located close to the general base Lys70, which results in a decrease of the number of hydrogen-bonding interactions stabilising the catalytic water molecule.",

In this study, we identify three penicillinase-binding peptides, P1 (DHIHRSYRGEFD), P2 (NIYTTPWGSNWS), and P3 (SHSLPASADLRR), using a phage display library. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is utilized for quantitative determination and comparison of the binding specificity of selected peptides to penicillinase. An SPR biosensor functionalized with P3-GGGC (SHSLPASADLRRGGGC) is developed for detection of penicillinase with excellent sensitivity (15.8 RU nM(-1)) and binding affinity (KD = 0.56 nM). To determine if peptides can be good inhibitors for penicillinase, these peptides are mixed with penicillinase and their inhibition efficiency is determined by measuring the hydrolysis of substrate penicillin G using UV-vis spectrophotometry. Peptide P2 (NIYTTPWGSNWS) is found to be a promising penicillinase inhibitor with a Ki of 9.22 \u03bcM and a Ki' of 33.12 \u03bcM, suggesting that the inhibition mechanism is a mixed pattern. This peptide inhibitor (P2) can be used as a lead compound to identify more potent small molecule inhibitors for penicillinase.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19100272": "Molecular evolution has always been a subject of discussions, and researchers are interested in understanding how proteins with similar scaffolds can catalyze different reactions. In the superfamily of serine penicillin-recognizing enzymes, D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidases and beta-lactamases are phylogenetically linked but feature large differences of reactivity towards their respective substrates. In particular, while beta-lactamases hydrolyze penicillins very fast, leading to their inactivation, these molecules inhibit d-alanyl-d-alanine peptidases by forming stable covalent penicilloyl enzymes. In cyanobacteria, we have discovered a new family of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) presenting all the sequence features of class A beta-lactamases but having a six-amino-acid deletion in the conserved Omega-loop and lacking the essential Glu166 known to be involved in the penicillin hydrolysis mechanism. With the aim of evolving a member of this family into a beta-lactamase, PBP-A from Thermosynechococcus elongatus has been chosen because of its thermostability. Based on sequence alignments, introduction of a glutamate in position 158 of the shorter Omega-loop afforded an enzyme with a 50-fold increase in the rate of penicillin hydrolysis. The crystal structures of PBP-A in the free and penicilloylated forms at 1.9 A resolution and of L158E mutant at 1.5 A resolution were also solved, giving insights in the catalytic mechanism of the proteins. Since all the active-site elements of PBP-A-L158E, including an essential water molecule, are almost perfectly superimposed with those of a class A beta-lactamase such as TEM-1, the question why our mutant is still 5 orders of magnitude less active as a penicillinase remains and our results emphasize how far we are from understanding the secrets of enzymes. Based on the few minor differences between the active sites of PBP-A and TEM-1, mutations were introduced in the L158E enzyme, but while activities on D-Ala-D-Ala mimicking substrates were severely impaired, further improvement in penicillinase activity was unsuccessful.",

However, they are ineffective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, due to the production of a beta-lactamase enzyme encoded on the chromosome of M. tuberculosis that degrades these antibiotics. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that deletion of the blaC gene, the only gene encoding a beta-lactamase in M. tuberculosis, or inhibition of the encoded enzyme resulted in significantly increased sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. In this paper we present a biochemical and structural characterization of M. tuberculosis BlaC. Recombinant BlaC shows a broad range of specificity with almost equal penicillinase and cepholothinase activity. While clavulanate is a mechanism-based inhibitor to class A beta-lactamase with high potency (typically K(i) &lt; 0.1 microM), it is a relatively poor inhibitor of the M. tuberculosis BlaC (K(i) = 2.4 microM). The crystal structure of the enzyme, determined at a resolution of 1.7 A, shows that the overall fold of the M. tuberculosis enzyme is similar to other class A beta-lactamases. There are, however, several distinct features of the active site, such as the amino acid substitutions N132G, R164A, R244A, and R276E, that explain the broad specificity of the enzyme, relatively low penicillinase activity, and resistance to clavulanate.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16772461": "The dentition, sense of taste and meal patterning of domestic dogs and cats can be interpreted in terms of their descent from members of the order Carnivora. The dog is typical of its genus, Canis, in its relatively unspecialized dentition, and a taste system that is rather insensitive to salt. The preference of many dogs for large infrequent meals reflects the competitive feeding behavior of its pack-hunting ancestor, the wolf Canis lupus. However, its long history of domestication, possibly 100,000 years, has resulted in great intraspecific diversity of conformation and behavior, including feeding. Morphologically and physiologically domestic cats are highly specialized carnivores, as indicated by their dentition, nutritional requirements, and sense of taste, which is insensitive to both salt and sugars. Their preference for several small meals each day reflects a daily pattern of multiple kills of small prey items in their ancestor, the solitary territorial predator Felis silvestris. Although in the wild much of their food selection behavior must focus on what to hunt, rather than what to eat, cats do modify their food preferences based on experience. For example, the \"monotony effect\" reduces the perceived palatability of foods that have recently formed a large proportion of the diet, in favor of foods with contrasting sensory characteristics, thereby tending to compensate for any incipient nutritional deficiencies. Food preferences in kittens during weaning are strongly influenced by those of their mother, but can change considerably during at least the first year of life.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9591631": "The cellular protooncogene MYC encodes a nuclear transcription factor that is involved in regulating important cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Dysregulated MYC expression appears critical to the development of various types of malignancies, and thus factors involved in regulating MYC expression may also play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers. We have cloned one such MYC regulatory factor, termed CTCF, which is a highly evolutionarily conserved-11-zinc finger transcriptional factor possessing multiple DNA sequence specificity. CTCF binds to a number of important regulatory regions within the 5' noncoding sequence of the human MYC oncogene, and it can regulate its transcription in several experimental systems. CTCF mRNA is expressed in cells of multiple different lineages. Enforced ectopic expression of CTCF inhibits cell growth in culture. Southern blot analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with normal human metaphase chromosomes showed that the human CTCF is a single-copy gene situated at chromosome locus 16q22. Cytogenetic studies have pointed out that chromosome abnormalities (deletions) at this locus frequently occur in many different human malignancies, suggesting the presence of one or more tumor suppressor genes in the region. To narrow down their localization, several loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies of chromosome arm 16q in sporadic breast and prostate cancers have been carried out to define the most recurrent and smallest region(s) of overlap (SRO) for commonly deleted chromosome arm 16q material. For CTCF to be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene associated with tumorigenesis, it should localize within one of the SROs at 16q. Fine-mapping of CTCF has enabled us to assign the CTCF gene to about a 2 centiMorgan (cM) interval of 16q22.1 between the somatic cell hybrid breakpoints CY130(D) and CY4, which is between markers D16S186 (16AC16-101) and D16S496 (AFM214zg5). This relatively small region, containing the CTCF gene, overlaps the most frequently observed SROs for common chromosomal deletions found in sporadic breast and prostate tumors. In one of four analyzed paired DNA samples from primary breast cancer patients, we have detected a tumor-specific rearrangement of CTCF exons encoding the 11-zinc-finger domain. Therefore, taken together with other CTCF properties, localization of CTCF to a narrow cancer-associated chromosome region suggests that CTCF is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene at 16q22.1.",

To determine how these varying effects would integrate in vivo, we engineered a variety of expression systems to study effects of CTCF on cell growth. Here we show that ectopic expression of CTCF in many cell types inhibits cell clonogenicity by causing profound growth retardation without apoptosis. In asynchronous cultures, the cell-cycle profile of CTCF-expressing cells remained unaltered, which suggested that progression through the cycle was slowed at multiple points. Although conditionally induced CTCF caused the S-phase block, CTCF can also arrest cell division. Viable CTCF-expressing cells could be maintained without dividing for several days. While MYC is the well-characterized CTCF target, the inhibitory effects of CTCF on cell growth could not be ascribed solely to repression of MYC, suggesting that additional CTS-driven genes involved in growth-regulatory circuits, such as p19ARF, are likely to contribute to CTCF-induced growth arrest. These findings indicate that CTCF may regulate cell-cycle progression at multiple steps within the cycle, and add to the growing evidence for the function of CTCF as a tumor suppressor gene.",

We have investigated the subcellular localization of CTCF in detail. Interestingly, we observe that CTCF shows a dynamic cell cycle-dependent distribution. Immunofluorescent staining reveals that in interphase CTCF is a nuclear protein, which is mainly excluded from the nucleolus. Strikingly, CTCF is associated with the centrosome during mitosis, especially from metaphase to anaphase. At telophase, CTCF dissociates from the centrosome and localizes to the midbody and the reformed nuclei. The association of CTCF with centrosomes and the midbody is further confirmed by biochemical fractionation. Moreover, subcellular fractions of CTCF show cell cycle and organelle-specific posttranslational modifications, suggesting different roles for CTCF at different stages of the cell cycle.",

Moreover, we discussed common features of CTCF at each tumor-related DNA-binding sequence, such as protein-partners, post-translational modifications, and distinctive epigenetic marks establishment. The investigation of the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate tumor-related genes emphasizes the cell-type dependency of its tumor suppressor role.

Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. In contrast to the single-motif CTCF target sites (1xCTSes), the 2xCTS elements are preferentially found at active promoters and enhancers, both in cancer and germ cells. 2xCTSes are also enriched in genomic regions that escape histone to protamine replacement in human and mouse sperm. Depletion of the BORIS gene leads to altered transcription of a large number of genes and the differentiation of K562 cells, while the ectopic expression of this CTCF paralog leads to specific changes in transcription in MCF7 cells. We discover two functionally and structurally different classes of CTCF binding regions, 2xCTSes and 1xCTSes, revealed by their predisposition to bind BORIS.

It was found five CTCF sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21 occupancy was reduced in the \u03b2-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293 cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2.

A major latency control region has been identified upstream of the divergent promoters for the multicistronic transcripts encoding LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72), and vFLIP (ORF71) and for the complementary strand transcript encoding K14 and vGPCR (ORF74). Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex. Deletion of the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral genome instability. We now show that the KSHV genes regulated by CTCF-cohesin are under cell cycle control and that mutation of the CTCF binding sites abolished cell cycle-regulated transcription. Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of Rad21 repressed CTCF-regulated transcription of KSHV lytic genes, and a Rad21-CTCF chimeric protein converted CTCF into an efficient transcriptional repressor of KSHV genes normally activated in the G(2) phase. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival.",

The two clinical groups showed impairments in all measures, most of which survived covariation with executive functions. However, the key finding concerned asymptomatic mutation carriers. While these subjects showed intact executive, semantic, and action-verb production skills, they evinced deficits in a syntactic test with minimal working memory load. We propose that this sui generis disturbance may constitute a prodromal sign anticipating eventual development of PD.

Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), currently the only gene associated with DBA, is mutated in 25% of DBA patients, but its role in erythropoiesis is unknown. We attempted to elucidate the importance of RPS19 in translation in relation to the pathogenesis of DBA. We measured translation and proliferation rates in unstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes isolated from DBA patients, as well as in K562 cells expressing several RPS19 mutants to directly test the effect of RPS19 mutations on translation. The effect of leucine on overall translation was also studied. We found that the level of translation was on average 48-73% of controls in both unstimulated and PHA-activated DBA lymphocytes irrespective of mutations in RPS19. The addition of leucine increased the translational level in RPS19-non-mutated DBA cells, but not in cells with an RPS19 mutation. In unstimulated DBA cells, proliferation was significantly impaired in both RPS19-mutated and non-mutated cells, but in both groups could be efficiently activated by PHA. Studies on K562 cells showed that RPS19 mutations affecting RPS19 conserved arginines R56Q and R62Q could significantly inhibit the rate of protein synthesis, indicating the importance of RPS19 in translation. Our results indicate that inefficient translation may be the main cause of DBA, and administration of leucine may be beneficial for at least some DBA patients.",

Since some patients with DBA develop a reduction in thrombocytes and granulocytes with age, we asked whether multipotent hematopoietic progenitors from DBA patients had normal proliferative capacity in liquid expansion cultures. CD34(+) cells derived from DBA patients showed deficient proliferation in liquid culture containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Single CD34(+) CD38(-) cells from DBA patients exhibited deficient proliferation recruitment in a limiting dilution assay containing IL-3, IL-6, SCF, Tpo, FL, and G-CSF or containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Our findings suggest that the underlying hematopoietic defect in DBA may not be limited to the erythroid lineage. Since a fraction of DBA patients have a deficiency in ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), we constructed lentiviral vectors containing the RPS19 gene for overexpression in hematopoietic progenitors from RPS19-deficient DBA patients. Enforced expression of the RPS19 transgene improved the proliferation of CD34(+) cells from DBA patients with RPS19 mutation. Similarly, enforced expression of RPS19 improved erythroid development of RPS19-deficient hematopoietic progenitors as determined by colony assays and erythroid differentiation cultures.

DBA is a heterogeneous disorder, caused in about 25% of cases by heterozygous mutations in the RPS19 gene (DBA1). Mutation analysis in our cases did not show an RPS19 mutation, and 2 alleles were present in each. Segregation analysis for DBA1 on chromosome 19 and DBA2 on 8p23 was not consistent with linkage.

Mechanistic understanding of the role of RPS19 in normal erythropoiesis and in the Diamond-Blackfan anemia defect is still poor. However, defective ribosome biogenesis and, in particular, impaired 18S ribosomal RNA maturation have been documented in association with various identified RPS19 mutations. Recently, new genes, all encoding ribosomal proteins, have been found to be mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, adding further support to the concept that ribosome biogenesis plays an important role in regulating erythropoiesis. We previously showed variability in the levels of expression and subcellular localization of a subset of RPS19 mutant proteins. To define the mechanistic basis for this variability better, we studied a large number of mutant proteins and characterized both RPS19 expression level using a specific antibody against RPS19 and RPS19 subcellular localization after transfection of Cos-7 cells with various green fluorescent protein-RPS19 mutants. To investigate the role of the proteasome in RPS19 degradation, we examined the effect of various proteasome inhibitors, namely lactacystin, MG132, and bortezomib on RPS19 expression and subcellular localization We found two distinct classes of RPS19 protein defects in Diamond-Blackfan anemia based on the stability of the mutant proteins: (i) slightly decreased to normal levels of expression and normal nucleolar localization and (ii) markedly deficient expression and failure to localize to the nucleolus. All the proteasome inhibitors tested were able to restore the expression levels and normal subcellular localization of several unstable mutant proteins. Our findings demonstrate an important role for the proteasomal degradation pathway in regulating the expression levels and nucleolar localization of certain mutant RPS19 proteins in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.",

In these cases DBA is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and RPS19 haploinsufficiency is thought to cause the disease. To study the molecular pathogenesis of DBA we used siRNA to decrease the level of RPS19 in two human cell lines, HeLa cells and U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells. Cells with reduced RPS19 levels showed a dramatic reduction in the amounts of small 40S ribosome subunits and mature 80S ribosomes and an excess of large 60S subunits. These cells were defective in 18S rRNA production and accumulated 21S and 20S nuclear pre-rRNA molecules, suggesting that RPS19 is required for specific steps in rRNA processing. RPS19 depletion produced a reduction in steady-state levels of RPS6 and RPS16 via a post-transcriptional mechanism while the levels of RPL7 and RPL26 were unaltered, indicating that levels of ribosomal proteins are determined by subunit assembly. This has interesting implications for the pathogenesis of DBA suggesting that deficiency of any of the RPS proteins might have a similar effect and thus may be responsible for causing DBA. Finally in cell lines from DBA patients with mutations we find increased levels of 21S rRNA precursors but no abnormality in the ribosome profile on sucrose gradients or in the steady-state levels of RPS19 suggesting that some cells can partially compensate for the loss of one allele of RPS19. We conclude that defects in ribosome biogenesis may underlie the pathology of Diamond Blackfan Anemia.",

It has been proven that defects of ribosomal proteins can lead to this disease and that RPS19 is the most frequently mutated gene in DBA patients. Previous studies suggest that p53-dependent genes and pathways play important roles in RPS19-deficient embryos. However, whether there are other vital factors linked to DBA has not been fully clarified. In this study, we compared the whole genome RNA-Seq data of zebrafish embryos injected with RPS19 morpholino (RPS19 MO), RPS19 and p53 morpholino simultaneously (RPS19+p53 MO) and control morpholino (control). We found that genes enriched in the functions of hematological systems, nervous system development and skeletal and muscular disorders had significant differential expression in RPS19 MO embryos compared with controls. Co-inhibition of p53 partially alleviates the abnormalities for RPS19-deficient embryos. However, the hematopoietic genes, which were down-regulated significantly in RPS19 MO embryos, were not completely recovered by the co-inhibition of p53. Furthermore, we identified the genome-wide p53-dependent and -independent genes and pathways. These results indicate that not only p53 family members but also other factors have important impacts on RPS19-deficient embryos.

Various mutations have been identified in the RPS19 gene, but no investigations regarding the effect of these alterations on RPS19 mRNA levels have been performed. It is well established that mutated mRNA containing a premature stop codon (PTC) or lacking a stop codon can be rapidly degraded by specific mechanisms called nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and nonstop decay. To study the involvement of such mechanisms in DBA, we analyzed immortalized lymphoblastoid cells and primary fibroblasts from patients presenting different kinds of mutations in the RPS19 gene, generating allelic deletion, missense, nonsense, and nonstop messengers. We found that RPS19 mRNA levels are decreased in the cells with allelic deletion and, to a variable extent, also in all the cell lines with PTC or nonstop mutations. Further analysis showed that translation inhibition causes a stabilization of the mutated RPS19 mRNA. Our findings indicate that NMD and nonstop decay affect the expression of mutated RPS19 genes; this may help to clarify genotype-phenotype correlations in DBA.",

The consequence of these mutations on the onset of the disease remains obscure. Here, we show that RPS19 plays an essential role in biogenesis of the 40S small ribosomal subunit in human cells. Knockdown of RPS19 expression by siRNAs impairs 18S rRNA synthesis and formation of 40S subunits and induces apoptosis in HeLa cells. Pre-rRNA processing is altered, which leads to an arrest in the maturation of precursors to the 18S rRNA. Under these conditions, pre-40S particles are not exported to the cytoplasm and accumulate in the nucleoplasm of the cells in perinuclear dots. Consistently, we find that ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization is altered in skin fibroblasts from DBA patients bearing mutations in the RPS19 gene. In addition, maturation of the 18S rRNA is also perturbed in cells from a patient bearing no RPS19-related mutation. These results support the hypothesis that DBA is directly related to a defect in ribosome biogenesis and indicate that yet to be discovered DBA-related genes may be involved in the synthesis of the ribosomal subunits.",

Currently no information is available on the subcellular localization of normal RPS19 and the potential effects of various RPS19 mutations on cellular localization. In the present study, using wild-type and mutant RPS19 cDNA, we explored the subcellular distribution of normal and mutant proteins in a fibroblast cell line (Cos-7 cells). RPS19 was detected primarily in the nucleus, and more specifically in the nucleoli, where RPS19 colocalized with the nucleolar protein nucleolin. Using various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs, we identified 2 nucleolar localization signals (NoSs) in RPS19: the first comprising amino acids Met1 to Arg16 in the NH2-terminus and the second comprising Gly120 to Asn142 in the COOH-terminus. Importantly, 2 mutations identified in DBA patients, Val15Phe and Gly127Gln, each of which localized to 1 of the 2 NoS, failed to localize RPS19 to the nucleolus. In addition to their mislocalization, there was a dramatic decrease in the expression of the 2 mutant proteins compared to the wild type. This decrease in protein expression was specific for the mutant RPS19, since expression of other proteins was normal. The present findings enable us to document the nucleolar localization signals in RPS19 and help define the phenotypic consequences of some mutations in RPS19 in DBA.",

Moreover, ChIPseq data analysis also demonstrates that several RP genes are enriched as potential GATA1 and PU.1 gene targets in mouse and human erythroid cells, with GATA1 binding showing an association with higher ribosomal protein gene expression levels during terminal erythroid differentiation in human and mouse.

Mutations in RPS19, RPS26 and RPS17 were detected in four, two and one patient, respectively. Among the mutations detected in RPS19, two mutations were novel (c.26T&gt;A, c.357-2A&gt;G). For the mutation-negative cases, array-CGH analysis was performed to identify copy-number variations, and no deletions involving the known DBA gene regions were identified. The relative mRNA expression of RPS19 estimated using real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed two- to fourfold reductions in RPS19 mRNA expression in three patients with RPS19 mutations, and p53 protein expression analysis by immunohistochemistry showed variable but significant nuclear staining in the DBA patients. In conclusion, heterozygous mutations in the known DBA genes RPS19, RPS26 and RPS17 were detected in seven out of nine Korean DBA patients.

Changes in the nucleotide sequences of enhancers may therefore lead to changes in gene expression, representing a central mechanism by which organisms evolve. With the development of the experimental technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in which discrete regions of the genome bound by specific proteins can be identified, it is now possible to identify transcription factor binding events (putative cis-regulatory elements) in entire genomes. Comparing protein-DNA binding maps allows us, for the first time, to attempt to identify regulatory differences and infer global patterns of change in gene expression across species. Here, we review studies that used genome-wide ChIP to study the evolution of enhancers. The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes. We speculate on the meaning of the differences observed and discuss that although ChIP experiments identify the biochemical event of protein-DNA interaction, it cannot determine whether the event results in a biological function, and therefore more studies are required to establish the effect of divergence of binding events on species-specific gene expression.",

Most of the recently evolved enhancers arise from ancestral DNA exaptation, rather than lineage-specific expansions of repeat elements. In contrast, almost all liver promoters are partially or fully conserved across these species.

However, constraints acting on evolving transcriptional regulatory sequences, e.g. enhancers, are largely unknown. Recently, we elucidated how a novel expression pattern of the Neprilysin-1 (Nep1) gene in the optic lobe of Drosophila santomea evolved via co-option of existing enhancer activities. Drosophila santomea, which has diverged from Drosophila yakuba by approximately 400 000 years has accumulated four fixed mutations that each contribute to the full activity of this enhancer. Recreating and testing the optic lobe enhancer of the ancestor of D. santomea and D. yakuba revealed that the strong D. santomea enhancer activity evolved from a weak ancestral activity. Because each mutation on the path from the D. yakuba/santomea ancestor to modern-day D. santomea contributes to the newly derived optic lobe enhancer activity, we sought here to use this system to study the path of evolution of enhancer sequences. We inferred likely paths of evolution of this enhancer by observing the transcriptional output of all possible intermediate steps between the ancestral D. yakuba/santomea enhancer and the modern D. santomea enhancer. Many possible paths had epistatic and cooperative effects. Furthermore, we found that several paths significantly increased ectopic transcriptional activity or affected existing enhancer activities from which the novel activity was co-opted. We suggest that these attributes highlight constraints that guide the path of evolution of enhancers.",

Surgery was performed in patients with severe electrodiagnostic CTS findings, CTS duration &gt;1 year and flattening along with hypervascularization in median nerve. All patients were assessed by visual analog scale, two-point discrimination test as well as subjective and objective findings at baseline and on the months 1, 3, and 6 after surgery. The mean age was 58.3 years (42-75 years) in 38 patients who underwent an epineurectomy, whereas it was 61.5 years (41-82 years) in 34 patients who did not have an epineurectomy. The groups were similar with regard to age, gender, duration of symptoms, and preoperative physical findings. Mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores were 1.7 in Group A and 1.8 in Group B. Again, these differences were not significant, on physical examination, the average two-point discrimination in the distribution of the median nerve was 4.9 mm (range: 3-11 mm) in Group A and 5.3 mm (range: 3-10 mm) in Group B. In postoperative evaluations, there was a better improvement in visual analog scale scores, two-point discrimination test and subjective symptoms including dysesthesia, pain and nocturnal pain within first 3 months; however, there was no marked difference in objective and subjective findings on the 6th month.

In this study, we assess the progression of cardiovascular remodeling from the compensatory to decompensatory phase, with a focus on the change in LOX expression and activity as it relates to alterations in ECM composition and changes in cardiac function. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied after 4, 14, or 21weeks of aortocaval fistula-induced volume overload (VO). Progressive increases in the left and right ventricular mass indicated biventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography revealed significant increases in the posterior wall thickness and internal diameter of the left ventricle as early as 3weeks, which persisted until the 21week endpoint. There were also significant decreases in eccentric index and fractional shortening in VO animals. Hemodynamic measurements showed progressive decreases in contractility, indicative of systolic dysfunction. There were progressive VO-induced increases in LOX expression and activity, collagen, and collagen cross-linking during the course of these experiments. We observed a negative correlation between LOX activity and cardiac function. Additional rats were treated with an inhibitor of LOX activity starting at 2weeks post-surgery and continued to 14weeks. LOX inhibition prevented the cardiac dysfunction and collagen accumulation caused by VO. Overall these data suggest a detrimental role for the chronic increase of cardiac LOX expression and activity in the transition from compensated remodeling to decompensated failure.",

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of LOX inhibition to prevent adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and dysfunction using an experimental model of HF. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to surgically induced volume overload (VO) by creation of aortocaval fistula (ACF). A LOX inhibitor, beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN; 100 mg/kg/day), was administered to rats with ACF or sham surgery at eight weeks postsurgery. Echocardiography was used to assess progressive alterations in cardiac ventricular structure and function. Left ventricular (LV) catheterization was used to assess alterations in contractility, stiffness, LV pressure and volume, and other indices of cardiac function. The LV ECM alterations were assessed by: (a) histological staining of collagen, (b) protein expression of collagen types I and III, (c) hydroxyproline assay, and (d) cross-linking assay. LOX inhibition attenuated VO-induced increases in cardiac stress, and attenuated increases in interstitial myocardial collagen, total collagen, and protein levels of collagens I and III. Both echocardiography and catheterization measurements indicated improved cardiac function post-VO in BAPN treated rats vs. untreated. Inhibition of LOX attenuated VO-induced decreases in LV stiffness and cardiac function. Overall, our data indicate that LOX inhibition was cardioprotective in the volume overloaded heart.",

We explore the impact of LOX inhibition in ECM alterations induced by obesity in the cardiovascular system. LOX is overexpressed in the heart and aorta from rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). \u03b2-Aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of LOX activity, significantly attenuated the increase in body weight and cardiac hypertrophy observed in HFD rats. No significant differences were found in cardiac function or blood pressure among any group. However, HFD rats showed cardiac and vascular fibrosis and enhanced levels of superoxide anion (O2(-)), collagen I and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in heart and aorta and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in aorta, effects that were attenuated by LOX inhibition. Interestingly, BAPN also prevented the increase in circulating leptin levels detected in HFD fed animals. Leptin increased protein levels of collagen I, TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF, Akt phosphorylation and O2(-) production in both cardiac myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells in culture, while LOX inhibition ameliorated these alterations. LOX knockdown also attenuated leptin-induced collagen I production in cardiovascular cells. Our findings indicate that LOX inhibition attenuates the fibrosis and the oxidative stress induced by a HFD on the cardiovascular system. The reduction of leptin levels by BAPN in vivo and the ability of this compound to inhibit leptin-induced profibrotic mediators and ROS production in cardiac and vascular cells suggest that interactions between leptin and LOX regulate downstream events responsible for myocardial and vascular fibrosis in obesity.",

The best-studied role of LOX enzymes is the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in animals by cross-linking collagens and elastin, although intracellular functions have been reported as well. Five different LOX enzymes have been identified in mammals, LOX and LOX-like (LOXL) 1 to 4, showing a highly conserved catalytic carboxy terminal domain and more divergence in the rest of the sequence. Here we have surveyed a wide selection of genomes in order to infer the evolutionary history of LOX. We identified LOX proteins not only in animals, but also in many other eukaryotes, as well as in bacteria and archaea - which reveals a pre-metazoan origin for this gene family. LOX genes expanded during metazoan evolution resulting in two superfamilies, LOXL2/L3/L4 and LOX/L1/L5. Considering the current knowledge on the function of mammalian LOX isoforms in ECM remodeling, we propose that LOXL2/L3/L4 members might have preferentially been involved in making cross-linked collagen IV-based basement membrane, whereas the diversification of LOX/L1/L5 forms contributed to chordate/vertebrate-specific ECM innovations, such as elastin and fibronectin. Our work provides a novel view on the evolution of this family of enzymes.",

It addresses many unmet needs of currently available anti-herpesvirus therapies. Valaciclovir extends the efficacy of aciclovir in the treatment of herpes zoster and genital HSV infections, using less frequent dose regimens but retaining the highly acceptable safety profile established for aciclovir. The potential for valaciclovir in CMV prophylaxis has now been proven, and further refining to identify the optimal dose regimen is ongoing. After oral administration, valaciclovir is rapidly absorbed and extensively converted to aciclovir and L-valine, the essential amino acid. The mode of action and spectrum of antiviral activity of valaciclovir are thus identical to aciclovir. The bioavailability of aciclovir after valaciclovir, characterised from studies in healthy adult volunteers, is similar in a wide range of patient populations, including the elderly, those with advanced HIV disease, patients with impaired liver or renal function, or undergoing bone marrow transplantation. No clinically significant drug interactions with valaciclovir have so far been identified. Dosage reductions in clinical use of valaciclovir are only necessary when renal function is severely impaired. In controlled clinical trials in herpes zoster, valaciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) is superior to aciclovir in speeding the resolution of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. It is as effective as aciclovir in hastening rash healing. In patients with ophthalmic zoster, no differences were evident between valaciclovir and aciclovir treatment on zoster-associated pain or the occurrence of ocular complications. The safety profiles of valaciclovir, aciclovir and placebo were not different in this study programme. In a series of controlled, randomised trials of valaciclovir, aciclovir and placebo for the acute treatment of genital HSV infections in approximately 3000 patients, twice daily valaciclovir was proven as effective as the standard 5 times daily aciclovir regimen in resolving the clinical signs and symptoms of lesional disease. Early patient-initiated valaciclovir therapy (500 mg twice daily) of recurrent genital herpes episodes was shown significantly to increase the chance of prevention of vesicular or ulcerative lesions, a valuable clinical advantage not prospectively proven for aciclovir. When used for periods of up to one year, valaciclovir (500 mg once daily) effectively suppresses genital herpes recurrences. Long-term studies of valaciclovir for HSV suppression, evaluating doses of up to 1000 mg daily in approximately 3000 patients, about 25% of whom were HIV seropositive (CD+ &gt; 100 cells/microl), revealed a highly acceptable clinical tolerability profile for valaciclovir that did not differ from aciclovir or placebo. There were no cases resembling thrombotic microangiopathy in these long-term studies. The aciclovir safety heritage and pharmacokinetic rationale for the development of valaciclovir have been realised through the clinical research programmes in the zoster and HSV indications. Further studies in these and related areas, including CMV prophylaxis, are in progress and aim to expand further the clinical potential of valaciclovir in the future.",

While sometimes mild in severity, it can be a distressing and painful chronic condition. Likewise, herpes labialis and herpes zoster can be both physically and psychologically painful. While there is no cure for these conditions, treatment to alleviate symptoms, suppress recurrences and reduce transmission has been drastically improved over the past 20 years with the use of guanine nucleoside antivirals, such as valacyclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex), GlaxoSmithKline) the highly bioavailable prodrug of acyclovir (Zovirax((R)), GlaxoSmithKline), and famciclovir (Famvir, Novartis), a highly bioavailable prodrug of penciclovir (Denavir, Novartis). Clinical trials involving approximately 10,000 patients (including patients from nongenital herpes studies, such as herpes zoster) have assessed the safety and efficacy of valacyclovir in the treatment of initial genital herpes outbreaks, episodic treatment of recurrent episodes and daily suppressive therapy. It was shown that valacyclovir has similar efficacy to acyclovir in the episodic and suppressive treatment of genital herpes. Valacyclovir is the only antiviral drug approved for a once-daily dose of suppressive therapy for genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral drug US FDA approved for a 3-day regimen of episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes. In addition, valacyclovir is also indicated in the reduction of the sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus infection and for the treatment of herpes labialis. In herpes zoster, valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir or placebo (and as equally effective as famciclovir) in shortening the length and severity of herpes zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia. Valacyclovir has an acceptable safety profile in patients with herpes simplex and herpes zoster.

Topical and oral antiviral use have shown modest but statistically significant efficacy in treating herpes labialis with most studies demonstrating a significant reduction in episode length and/or healing time. Oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir are efficacious and safe for the treatment of the first episode and recurrent genital herpes and are useful as suppressive therapy for individuals with frequent genital herpes recurrences. In addition, high doses of oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir have been shown to speed the healing of herpes zoster, and data suggests that these agents also decrease associated acute and chronic pain in people of 50 years of age or older. Further research is required to clarify the safety of these agents in pregnant women with genital herpes, the role of antiviral therapy in decreasing the sexual transmission of genital herpes, and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these agents in treating herpes zoster in people below the age of 50 years.",

The absolute bioavailability of acyclovir from valaciclovir and the metabolic disposition of valaciclovir were investigated with healthy volunteers in two separate studies. In a randomized, crossover study, 12 fasting healthy volunteers each received 1,000 mg of oral valaciclovir and a 1-h intravenous infusion of 350 mg of acyclovir. The mean absolute bioavailability of acyclovir was 54.2%, a value three to five times that obtained previously with oral acyclovir. A similar estimate of 51.3% was made from urinary recovery of acyclovir. In the second study, four fasting volunteers received a single oral dose of 1,000 mg of [14C]valaciclovir. The majority of plasma radioactivity was accounted for by acyclovir, with very low plasma valaciclovir concentrations (mean maximum concentration of drug in plasma = 0.19 microM), which were undetectable after 3 h postdose. By 168 h, more than 90% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered, with approximately 45% in urine and 475 in feces. More than 99% of the radioactivity recovered in urine corresponded to acyclovir and its known metabolites, 9-(carboxymethoxymethyl)guanine and 8-hydroxy-9- [(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine, with valaciclovir accounting for less than 0.5% of the dose. Acyclovir, but no valaciclovir, was detected in fecal samples. These studies show that after oral administration to humans, valaciclovir is rapidly and virtually completely converted to acyclovir to provide a high level of acyclovir bioavailability in comparison with that following oral administration of acyclovir. The plasma acyclovir exposure obtained following oral administration of valaciclovir is similar to that achieved with doses of intravenous acyclovir, which are effective in the treatment and suppression of the less susceptible herpesviral diseases.",

Five days before admission, he visited an ophthalmologist with inflammation of the right palpebra and conjunctiva and began taking valacyclovir at a dose of 3,000 mg for the treatment of herpes zoster. Two days before admission, he was prescribed loxoprofen at a dose of 180 mg for a headache. One day prior to admission, he developed dysarthria, wandering and loss of appetite. He was subsequently admitted to our hospital with progressive deterioration of consciousness (Japan Coma Scale: II-20). On admission, he exhibited renal dysfunction, with a serum creatinine level of 5.11 mg/dl (eGFR: 9.16 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Based on his diverse symptoms and current treatment with valacyclovir, the patient was diagnosed with acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and his symptoms rapidly improved after hemodialysis. The serum acyclovir level on admission was found to be 9.25 \u03bcg/ml. Although acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity is commonly seen in elderly patients with renal dysfunction, there are also reports of this condition in patients with a normal renal function. Valacyclovir is frequently prescribed to the elderly to treat diseases such as herpes zoster. As valacyclovir induces renal dysfunction, which raises the serum acyclovir level to the toxic range, special attention must be paid when administering this drug in elderly subjects.",

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open clinical trial in order to evaluate the extent of pain relief afforded by these two antiviral drugs during the acute disease phase of herpes zoster. The study group comprised 86 immunocompetent adult patients suffering from herpes zoster, who were treated with either famciclovir or valacyclovir for 7 days. Of these, 55 patients enrolled in this study within 72 h of the onset of the rash and 31 patients after 72 h of the onset. There was a significant reduction in acute herpes zoster pain with famciclovir on day 7 and at 2-3 weeks in both of these patient groups, while with valacyclovir, there was not significant reduction in pain on day 7. Of patients aged 50 years or older, there was a significantly earlier reduction in pain with famciclovir than with valacyclovir. In addition, a significant reduction in the number of patients with pain was observed as early as days 3-4 with famciclovir treatment as compared with valacyclovir treatment. We conclude that famciclovir was superior to valacyclovir in the relief of acute pain of herpes zoster.

There are two types of melanin, the red phaeomelanin and the black eumelanin, both of which are present in human skin. Eumelanin is photoprotective whereas phaeomelanin, because of its potential to generate free radicals in response to UVR, may contribute to UV-induced skin damage. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of phaeomelain in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from UVR. In mammals the relative proportions of phaeomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), which acts via its receptor (MC1R), on melanocytes, to increase the synthesis of eumelanin and the product of the agouti locus which antagonises this action. In mice, mutations at either the MC1R gene or agouti affect the pattern of melanogenesis resulting in changes in coat colour. We now report the presence of MC1R gene sequence variants in humans. These were found in over 80% of individuals with red hair and/or fair skin that tans poorly but in fewer than 20% of individuals with brown or black hair and in less than 4% of those who showed a good tanning response. Our findings suggest that in humans, as in other mammals, the MC1R is a control point in the regulation of pigmentation phenotype and, more importantly, that variations in this protein are associated with a poor tanning response.",

In the mouse, variants of this receptor, which differ in their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase, are associated with different coat colors. In humans, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are associated with red hair and fair skin, and work in progress from our laboratory suggests that certain melanocortin 1 receptor variants may preferentially be associated with hair color rather than skin type.

Carriers of two variant alleles were at increased risk for developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (odds ratio 3.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.11-6.78), nodular basal cell carcinoma (odds ratio 2.26; 95% CI 1.45-3.52), and superficial multifocal basal cell carcinoma (odds ratio 3.43; 95% CI 1.92-6.15), compared with carriers of two wild-type alleles. Carriers of one variant allele had half the risk. The highest relative risks of nonmelanoma skin cancer were found in carriers of the Asp84Glu, His260Pro, and Asp294His variant alleles, and the risk was only slightly lower for carriers of the Val60Leu, Val92Met, Arg142His, Arg151Cys, and Arg160Trp variant alleles. When subjects were stratified by skin type and hair color, analysis showed that these factors did not materially change the relative risks. These findings indicate that MC1R gene variants are important independent risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer.",

A minisequencing profile which shows homozygosity for one of these mutations or the presence of two different mutations would strongly indicate that the sample donor is red haired. The absence of any red hair causing mutations would indicate that the sample donor does not have red hair. We report the frequencies of MC1R variants in the British red haired population.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10885670": "The melanocortin 1 receptor, a seven pass transmembrane G protein coupled receptor, is a key control point in melanogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations at the MC1R are associated with a switch from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production, resulting in a red or yellow coat colour. Activating mutations, in animals at least, lead to enhanced eumelanin synthesis. In man, a number of loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R have been described. The majority of red-heads (red-haired persons) are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for up to five frequent loss-of-function mutations. A minority of redheads are, however, only heterozygote. The MC1R is, therefore, a major determinant of sun sensitivity and a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Recent work suggests that the MC1R also shows a clear heterozygote effect on skin type, with up to 30% of the population harbouring loss-of-function mutations. Activating mutations of the MC1R in man have not been described. The MC1R is particularly informative and a tractable gene for studies of human evolution and migration. In particular, study of the MC1R may provide insights into the lightening of skin colour observed in most European populations. The world wide pattern of MC1R diversity is compatible with functional constraint operating in Africa, whereas the greater allelic diversity seen in non-African populations is consistent with neutral predictions rather than selection. Whether this conclusion is as a result of weakness in the statistical testing procedures applied, or whether it will be seen in other pigment genes will be of great interest for studies of human skin colour evolution.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15972726": "The human melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R) encodes a G-protein coupled receptor that is primarily expressed on melanocytes, where it plays a key role in pigmentation regulation. Variant alleles are associated with red hair colour and fair skin, known as the RHC phenotype, as well as skin cancer risk. The R151C, R160W and D294H alleles, designated 'R', are strongly associated with the RHC phenotype and have been proposed to result in loss of function receptors due to impaired G-protein coupling. We recently provided evidence that the R151C and R160W variants can efficiently couple to G-proteins in response to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone. The possibility that altered cellular localization of the R151C and R160W variant receptors could underlie their association with RHC was therefore considered. Using immunofluorescence and ligand binding studies, we found that melanocytic cells exogenously or endogenously expressing MC1R show strong surface localization of the wild-type and D294H alleles but markedly reduced cell surface expression of the R151C and R160W receptors. In additional exogenous expression studies, the R variant D84E and the rare I155T variant, also demonstrated a significant reduction in plasma membrane receptor numbers. The V60L, V92M and R163Q weakly associated RHC alleles, designated 'r', were expressed with normal or intermediate cell surface receptor levels. These results indicate that reduced receptor coupling activity may not be the only contributing factor to the genetic association between the MC1R variants and the RHC phenotype, with MC1R polymorphisms now linked to a change in receptor localization.",

The MC1R gene has many polymorphisms, some of which have been linked to variation in pigmentation phenotypes within human populations. In particular, the p.D84E, p.R151C, p.R160W and p.D294 H alleles have been strongly associated with red hair, fair skin and increased skin cancer risk. These red hair colour (RHC) variants are relatively well described and are thought to result in altered receptor function, while still retaining varying levels of signaling ability in vitro. The mouse Mc1r null phenotype is yellow fur colour, the p.R151C, p.R160W and p.D294 H alleles were able to partially rescue this phenotype, leading to the question of what the true null phenotype of MC1R would be in humans. Due to the rarity of MC1R null alleles in human populations, they have only been found in the heterozygous state until now. We report here the first case of a homozygous MC1R null individual, phenotypic analysis indicates that red hair and fair skin is found in the absence of MC1R function.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22140526": "Multiple loss-of-function (LOF) alleles at the same gene may influence a phenotype not only in the homozygote state when alleles are considered individually, but also in the compound heterozygote (CH) state. Such LOF alleles typically have low frequencies and moderate to large effects. Detecting such variants is of interest to the genetics community, and relevant statistical methods for detecting and quantifying their effects are sorely needed. We present a collapsed double heterozygosity (CDH) test to detect the presence of multiple LOF alleles at a gene. When causal SNPs are available, which may be the case in next generation genome sequencing studies, this CDH test has overwhelmingly higher power than single SNP analysis. When causal SNPs are not directly available such as in current GWA settings, we show the CDH test has higher power than standard single SNP analysis if tagging SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with the underlying causal SNPs to at least a moderate degree (r\u00b2&gt;0.1). The test is implemented for genome-wide analysis in the publically available software package GenABEL which is based on a sliding window approach. We provide the proof of principle by conducting a genome-wide CDH analysis of red hair color, a trait known to be influenced by multiple loss-of-function alleles, in a total of 7,732 Dutch individuals with hair color ascertained. The association signals at the MC1R gene locus from CDH were uniformly more significant than traditional GWA analyses (the most significant P for CDH = 3.11\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2074\u00b2 vs. P for rs258322 = 1.33\u00d710\u207b\u2076\u2076). The CDH test will contribute towards finding rare LOF variants in GWAS and sequencing studies.",

Loss-of-function MC1R variants, which impair protein function, are associated with red hair color (RHC) phenotype and increased skin cancer risk. Cultured cutaneous cells bearing loss-of-function MC1R variants show a distinct gene expression profile compared to wild-type MC1R cultured cutaneous cells. We analysed the gene signature associated with RHC co-cultured melanocytes and keratinocytes by Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to identify genes related with non-functional MC1R variants. From two detected networks, we selected 23 nodes as hub genes based on topological parameters. Differential expression of hub genes was then evaluated in healthy skin biopsies from RHC and black hair color (BHC) individuals. We also compared gene expression in melanoma tumors from individuals with RHC versus BHC. Gene expression in normal skin from RHC cutaneous cells showed dysregulation in 8 out of 23 hub genes (CLN3, ATG10, WIPI2, SNX2, GABARAPL2, YWHA, PCNA and GBAS). Hub genes did not differ between melanoma tumors in RHC versus BHC individuals. The study suggests that healthy skin cells from RHC individuals present a constitutive genomic deregulation associated with the red hair phenotype and identify novel genes involved in melanocyte biology.",

The receptor gene is highly polymorphic, which accounts for the association of several of its single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an increased risk of melanoma. The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution of melanocortin 1 receptor gene variants R151C, R160W, and D294H within the Russian population of Eastern Siberia and its association with melanoma development. Melanoma patients (n=95) admitted to Krasnoyarsk Territorial Oncological Center and healthy controls (n=334) were enrolled in the study. A clinical examination of patients was performed to evaluate the phenotypic features of melanoma patients. SNPs were analyzed by real-time PCR. Clinical examination indicated a more frequent occurrence of fair skin type, blue eyes, blonde and red hair, and more frequent localization of freckles on the neck, trunk, and extremities in the melanoma group of patients. The R151C melanocortin 1 receptor gene variant was found in 18% of melanoma patients and associated with an increased likelihood of melanoma development (odds ratio=6.4; 95% confidence interval: 2.8-14.3; P=0.0001). The two remaining variant alleles of the melanocortin 1 receptor gene occurred with low frequency both in controls and in the melanoma group. The R160W SNP was identified neither in controls nor in melanoma patients. The D294H heterozygous variant was observed in 0.3% of individuals in the control group and in 1.1% of the patients in the melanoma group. Such an asymmetric distribution of the melanocortin 1 receptor within red hair color genotypes in the population under study compared with other populations may be because of Russian genetic homogeneity. Carriers of the mutant R151C allele should exercise caution in terms of exposure to the sun to avoid the risk of melanoma development.",

Mutations of at least 11 loci produce this phenotype. The majority of affected individuals develop some cutaneous melanin; this is predominantly seen as yellow/blond hair, whereas fewer have brown hair. The OCA phenotype is dependent on the constitutional pigmentation background of the family, with more OCA pigmentation found in families with darker constitutional pigmentation, which indicates that other genes may modify the OCA phenotype. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in OCA. We identified eight probands with OCA who had red hair at birth. Mutations in the P gene were responsible for classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in all eight, and mutations in the MC1R gene were responsible for the red (rather than yellow/blond) hair in the six of eight who continued to have red hair after birth. This is the first demonstration of a gene modifying the OCA phenotype in humans.",

In humans, loss-of-function MC1R mutations cause fair skin, freckling, red hair, and increased predisposition to melanoma; in mice, Mc1r loss-of-function is responsible for the recessive yellow mutation, associated with pheomelanic hair and a decreased number of epidermal melanocytes. To better understand how Mc1r signaling affects different cutaneous phenotypes, we examined large-scale patterns of gene expression in different skin components (whole epidermal sheets, basal epidermal cells and whole skins) of neonatal (P2.5) normal and recessive yellow mice, starting with a 26K mouse cDNA microarray. From c. 17 000 genes whose levels could be accurately measured in neonatal skin, we identified 883, 2097 and 552 genes that were uniquely expressed in the suprabasal epidermis, basal epidermis and dermis, respectively; specific biologic roles could be assigned for each class. Comparison of normal and recessive yellow mice revealed 69 differentially expressed genes, of which the majority had not been previously implicated in Mc1r signaling. Surprisingly, many of the Mc1r-dependent genes are expressed in cells other than melanocytes, even though Mc1r expression in the skin is confined almost exclusively to epidermal melanocytes. These results reveal new targets for Mc1r signaling, and point to a previously unappreciated role for a Mc1r-dependent paracrine effect of melanocytes on other components of the skin.",

We show that a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) which contains Mc1r will efficiently rescue loss of Mc1r in transgenic mice, and that overexpression of the receptor suppresses the effect of the endogenous antagonist, agouti protein. We engineered the BAC to replace the mouse coding region with the human MC1R sequence and used this in the transgenic assay. The human receptor also efficiently rescued Mc1r deficiency, and in addition, appeared to be completely resistant to the effects of agouti, suggesting agouti protein may not play a role in human pigmentary variation. Three human variant alleles account for 60% of all cases of red hair. We engineered each of these in turn into the BAC and find that they have reduced, but not completely absent, function in transgenic mice.

We have investigated 174 individuals from 11 large kindreds with a preponderance of red hair and an additional 99 unrelated redheads, for MC1R variants and have confirmed that red hair is usually inherited as a recessive characteristic with the R151C, R160W, D294H, R142H, 86insA and 537insC alleles at this locus. The V60L variant, which is common in the population may act as a partially penetrant recessive allele. These individuals plus 167 randomly ascertained Caucasians demonstrate that heterozygotes for two alleles, R151C and 537insC, have a significantly elevated risk of red hair. The shade of red hair frequently differs in heterozygotes from that in homozygotes/compound heterozygotes and there is also evidence for a heterozygote effect on beard hair colour, skin type and freckling.

A specific variant of MC1R gene (R allele) is responsible for the red hair. The gene encodes a receptor for melanocortins. These substances stimulate melanocytes to product melanin- a dye of the skin which is transported to keratinocytes. It protects a cellular nucleus from ultraviolet radiation. Melanin has two types: eumelanin which is dark brown or even black and red/orange pheomelanin. The second one is mostly observed in red-headed which is caused by R allele. The DNA damage occurs more easily because of worse protecting ability of pheomelanin. Moreover this allele is connected with inefficient DNA repair. People with R allele have not only flaming red hairstyle but also very fair skin (often with freckles) and blue eyes. Unfortunately this phenotype is more exposed to harmful effects of UV rays. It means that too extensive exposition to solar light leads to sunburn and development of cancerous skin diseases with melanoma as the worst. R allele is a recessive variant of the gene so only in homozygous persons this characteristic phenotype is observed. Nevertheless blond- or auburn-haired carriers of this allele are also more prone to develop carcinomas. The red-headed also differ from the others in sensitivity to anaesthetics, what is shown by increased MAC. On the other hand these persons less often suffer from vitamin D deficiency.

The authors tested the hypothesis that having natural red hair color, a MC1R gene variant or both could predict a patient's experiencing dental care-related anxiety and dental care avoidance. The authors enrolled 144 participants (67 natural red-haired and 77 dark-haired) aged 18 to 41 years in a cross-sectional observational study. Participants completed validated survey instruments designed to measure general and dental care-specific anxiety, fear of dental pain and previous dental care avoidance. The authors genotyped participants' blood samples to detect variants associated with natural red hair color. Eighty-five participants had MC1R gene variants (65 of the 67 red-haired participants and 20 of the 77 dark-haired participants) (P &lt; .001). Participants with MC1R gene variants reported significantly more dental care-related anxiety and fear of dental pain than did participants with no MC1R gene variants. They were more than twice as likely to avoid dental care as were the participants with no MC1R gene variants, even after the authors controlled for general trait anxiety and sex. Dental care-related anxiety, fear of dental pain and avoidance of dental care may be influenced by genetic variations.

A single polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region occurred at a frequency of 0.2 in African-Americans. Variants of the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) gene have been found to be associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. Red hair individuals are usually compound heterozygotes or homozygous for one of a number of MC1R polymorphisms associated with red hair. Some individuals however are heterozygous for only one of these polymorphisms and dizygotic twins can be concordant for MC1R variants but discordant for hair colour. A recent study has also identified rare redheads carrying no MC1R variants indicating that polymorphisms of the human MC1R gene are required but not sufficient for the red hair phenotype. To address the question of whether ASP also contributes to the red hair phenotype, individuals previously identified as having unexpected MC1R genotypes were screened for polymorphisms at the ASP locus. No polymorphisms were found in any of these individuals. Results indicate that the human ASP gene is unlikely to function in normal human pigmentation in the same way as MC1R.",

We reviewed abstracts from the following relevant conferences: International AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. We searched reference lists for all primary and other pertinent articles identified. We attempted to contact experts in the field, particularly primary authors of included studies, to better ensure completeness of included studies. We also approached pharmaceutical companies for any available and relevant unpublished data. The time period searched was from 1980 to August 2004. We placed no language restrictions on the search. Key words used include: meningitis, cryptococcal, cryptococcus, cryptococcosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, prophylaxis, chemoprevention, antifungal agents, and the Cochrane screen for randomized controlled trials. Randomized controlled trials using antifungal interventions for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults with HIV were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. Trial authors, experts, and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for additional and/or missing information.

Patients were predominantly male; mean age was 35.9 years; AIDS was practically the only underlying disease, reported in 61.2% of cases; case-fatality was 51.8%. No decline in incidence was observed during the study period. AIDS is the main predisposing condition for cryptococcal meningitis, and thus the profile of most patients mirrors that of HIV infection. Missing information prevented the evaluation of other underlying diseases.",

There is little information specifically addressing cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients from North India. To determine clinical presentation, hospital course, response to treatment, complications developed, in-hospital mortality, any recurrence of cryptococcal meningitis and reasons of recurrence during follow-up. A retrospective observational study undertaken in a large tertiary care center. Patient's demographic data, presenting clinical symptomatology, physical findings, laboratory parameters, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination findings, side-effects of treatment, development of any complications and hospital outcome were analyzed. During follow-up any recurrence of cryptococcal meningitis, possible reasons of recurrence, type of treatment received, complications developed and outcome was recorded as well. Forty patients diagnosed to have cryptococcal meningitis were analyzed. Twenty-two (55%) patients had acute/ subacute presentation. Thirty-six (90%) patients presented with headache and 18 (45%) had altered sensorium. Twenty (50%) patients had no cells in the CSF. Hypoglycorrhchia was seen in 30 (75%) patients. Cryptococcal meningitis was the first acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness in 30 (75%) patients. Thirty-five patients developed some adverse effects to amphotericin-B. Thirty-three patients improved with treatment while three patients died. Four patients had recurrence of cryptococcal meningitis within six months of first episode. Non-compliance of fluconazole therapy was the reason for recurrence in all of these patients. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common initial AIDS-defining illness. Acute and/or subacute presentation of cryptococcal meningitis is not uncommon in HIV-infected individuals. An early diagnosis of HIV infection might reduce the incidence of this infection.",

The study was performed at a metropolitan hospital with a large indigent population and an incidence of seven cases of cryptococcal disease per 1000 persons with AIDS. Bivariate analysis, matched on CD4 count, revealed that both HAART use [odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.99] and azole use (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06-0.34) had a protective effect.

We conducted a genome-wide study of 1,000,000 genetic variants in 46 Tibetans (TBN) and 92 Han Chinese (HAN) for identifying the signals of high-altitude adaptations (HAAs) in Tibetan genomes. We discovered the most differentiated variants between TBN and HAN at chromosome 1q42.2 and 2p21. EGLN1 (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. Strong positive correlations were also observed between the frequency of TBN-dominant haplotypes in the two gene regions and altitude in East Asian populations. Linkage disequilibrium and further haplotype network analyses of world-wide populations suggested the antiquity of the TBN-dominant haplotypes and long-term persistence of the natural selection. Finally, a \"dominant haplotype carrier\" hypothesis could describe the role of the two genes in HAA. All of our population genomic and statistical analyses indicate that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are most likely responsible for HAA of Tibetans. Interestingly, one each but not both of the two genes were also identified by three recent studies. We reanalyzed the available data and found the escaped top signal (EPAS1) could be recaptured with data quality control and our approaches. Based on this experience, we call for more attention to be paid to controlling data quality and batch effects introduced in public data integration. Our results also suggest limitations of extended haplotype homozygosity-based method due to its compromised power in case the natural selection initiated long time ago and particularly in genomic regions with recombination hotspots.",

Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. The mechanisms that afford adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, however, remain unclear. Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, the putatively advantageous PPARA haplotype is correlated with serum free fatty acid concentrations, suggesting a possible decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation. Although further studies are required to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns, these associations suggest that genetic adaptation to high altitude involves alteration in energy utilization pathways.",

Both behavioral and biological adaptations have contributed to their success in surviving the rigors of climatic extremes, including cold, strong ultraviolet radiation, and high altitude. Among these environmental stresses, high-altitude hypoxia is the only condition in which traditional technology is incapable of mediating its effects. Inhabiting at &gt;3,000-m high plateau, the Tibetan population provides a widely studied example of high-altitude adaptation. Yet, the genetic mechanisms underpinning long-term survival in this environmental extreme remain unknown. We performed an analysis of genome-wide sequence variations in Tibetans. In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1. For these two genes, Tibetans show unusually high divergence from the non-Tibetan lowlanders (Han Chinese and Japanese) and possess high frequencies of many linked sequence variations as reflected by the Tibetan-specific haplotypes. Further analysis in seven Tibetan populations (1,334 individuals) indicates the prevalence of selective sweep across the Himalayan region. The observed indicators of natural selection on EPAS1 and EGLN1 suggest that during the long-term occupation of high-altitude areas, the functional sequence variations for acquiring biological adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia have been enriched in Tibetan populations.",

Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions. Uncovering the molecular basis of hypoxic adaptation should have implications for understanding hematological and other adaptations involved in hypoxia tolerance. Because the hypoxia response involves a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic functions, this knowledge would improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and could ultimately be translated into targeted therapies for oxygen deprivation, cardiopulmonary and cerebral pathologies, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity.",

However, the limited sequence variations analyzed in previous studies would not be sufficient to identify causal mutations. Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region (59.4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the genome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including 13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion). There is a nonsynonymous mutation (rs186996510, D4E) showing surprisingly deep divergence between Tibetans and lowlander populations (Fst = 0.709 between Tibetans and Han Chinese). It is highly prevalent in Tibetans (70.9% on average) but extremely rare in Han Chinese, Japanese, Europeans, and Africans (0.56-2.27%), suggesting that it might be the causal mutation of EGLN1 contributing to high-altitude hypoxic adaptation. Neutrality test confirmed the signal of Darwinian positive selection on EGLN1 in Tibetans. Haplotype network analysis revealed a Tibetan-specific haplotype, which is absent in other world populations. The estimated selective intensity (0.029 for the C allele of rs186996510) puts EGLN1 among the known genes that have undergone the strongest selection in human populations, and the onset of selection was estimated to have started at the early Neolithic (\u223c8,400 years ago). Finally, we detected a significant association between rs186996510 and hemoglobin levels in Tibetans, suggesting that EGLN1 contributes to the adaptively low hemoglobin level of Tibetans compared with acclimatized lowlanders at high altitude.",

It demonstrated that the C allele of rs56721780:G&gt;C decreased the binding of IKZF1, leading to the attenuated transcriptional repression of EPAS1 gene. The insertion at -742 indel provided a new binding site for Sp1 and was related to the activation of EPAS1 promoter. Further functional analysis revealed that lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene, which was reported to be responsible for extracellular matrix protein cross-linking of amnion previously, was a direct target of EPAS1. The CC genotype at rs56721780:G&gt;C and the insertion genotype at -742 indel were found associated with higher EPAS1 and LOX expression levels in amnion, as well as higher birth weight of Tibetan newborns, suggesting that EPAS1 gene might play important roles in the development of amnion, fetus growth and high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26053282": "What is the topic of this review? The topic of this review is how Tibetans have adapted genetically to high altitude, particularly with reference to altitude-induced changes in metabolism. What advances does it highlight? It highlights recent work on metabolic phenotyping in Tibetans and demonstrates that selected genetic haplotypes influence their metabolism of fats and glucose. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude. Consistent with the phenotype, EGLN1 in Tibetans has a gain-of-function mutation that confers a higher affinity for oxygen, hence less sensitivity to hypoxia. Considering the demands imposed upon metabolism in meeting energy demands despite limitations on fuel oxidation, we hypothesized that other selected genes might alter metabolism to allow adaptation to altitude despite the desensitization of the upstream hypoxia sensing caused by the EGLN1 mutation that results in the failure to sense hypoxia. A shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would provide adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Measurements of serum metabolites from Tibetans living at high altitude are consistent with this hypothesis; the EPAS1 haplotype is significantly associated with increased lactate levels (suggesting increased anaerobic metabolism), and the PPARA haplotype and serum free fatty acids are positively related (suggesting decreased fat oxidation). These data suggest that the high-altitude adaptations may offer protection from diabetes at high altitude but increase the risk of diabetes at lower elevations and/or with adoption of a non-traditional diet. It should also be considered in future work in the field that because iron is a cofactor for EGLN1, there may be significant associations of phenotypes with the significant degrees of variation seen in tissue iron among human populations.",

Among the adaptive traits in Tibetans, the relatively low hemoglobin level is considered a blunted erythropoietic response to hypoxic challenge. Previously, EPAS1 and EGLN1, the major upstream regulators in the hypoxic pathway, were reportedly involved in the hemoglobin regulation in Tibetans. In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans. We first resequenced the entire genomic region (45.6 kb) of HMOX2 in Tibetans, which confirmed the previously suspected signal of positive selection on HMOX2 in Tibetans. Subsequent association analyses of hemoglobin levels in two independent Tibetan populations (a total of 1,250 individuals) showed a male-specific association between the HMOX2 variants and hemoglobin levels. Tibetan males with the derived C allele at rs4786504:T&gt;C displayed lower hemoglobin level as compared with the T allele carriers. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments indicated that the C allele of rs4786504 could increase the expression of HMOX2, presumably leading to a more efficient breakdown of heme that may help maintain a relatively low hemoglobin level at high altitude. Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism.",

However, the history of these variants or that of Tibetans remains poorly understood. Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Accordingly, the Sherpa and Tibetans share adaptive haemoglobin traits. This admixture-mediated adaptation shares important features with adaptive introgression. Therefore, we identify a novel mechanism, beyond selection on new mutations or on standing variation, through which populations can adapt to local environments.",

The results found that Hb concentration in Himalayan highlanders was systemically lower than those reported for Andean natives and lowland immigrants. These comparative data demonstrated that a healthy native population may successfully reside at high altitude without a significant elevation in Hb, and the lower Hb levels of Himalayan highlanders than those of migrated lowlanders and Andean natives are an example of favourable adaptation over the generations. In addition, excessive polycythemia has frequently been used as a marker of chronic mountain sickness (CMS). Altitude populations who have a higher Hb concentration also have a higher incidence of CMS. The low Hb in Himalayans suggested as showing adaptation over many generations in Tibetan stock. Recent work in Tibet, suggested that Tibetans there may have adapted to high altitude as a result of evolutionary pressure selecting for genes which give an advantage at altitude. All of the population genomic and statistical analysis indicated that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are mostly likely responsible for high altitude adaptation and closely related to low Hb concentration in Tibetans. These data supported the hypothesis that Himalayan highlanders have evolved a genetically different erythropoietic response to chronic hypoxia by virtue of their much longer exposure to high altitude.",

Two high-altitude regions where humans have lived for millennia are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. Populations living in these regions exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude. Although these responses have been well characterized physiologically, their underlying genetic basis remains unknown. We performed a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition, groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations (Andeans and Tibetans) separately. The Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. However, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Our results indicate that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaption and provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.",

EGLN1/PHD2 and EPAS1/HIF-2\u03b1, both crucial components of hypoxia sensing, are the two best-established loci contributing to high altitude adaptation. The co-adapted Tibetan-specific haplotype encoding for PHD2:p.[D4E/C127S] promotes increased HIF degradation under hypoxic conditions. The Tibetan-specific 200 kb EPAS1 haplotype introgressed from an archaic human population related to Denisovans which underwent evolutionary decay; however, the functional variant(s) responsible for high-altitude adaptation at EPAS1/HIF-2\u03b1 have not yet been identified. Since HIF modulates the behavior of cancer cells, we hypothesized that these Tibetan selected genomic variants may modify cancer risk predisposition. Here, we ascertained the frequencies of EGLN1D4E/C127S and EGLN1C127S variants and ten EPAS1/HIF-2\u03b1 variants in lung cancer patients and controls in Nepal, whose population consists of people with Indo-Aryan origin and Tibetan-related Mongoloid origin. We observed a significant association between the selected Tibetan EGLN1/PHD2 haplotype and lung cancer (p=0.0012 for D4E, p=0.0002 for C127S), corresponding to a two-fold increase in lung cancer risk. We also observed a two-fold or greater increased risk for two of the ten EPAS1/HIF-2\u03b1 variants, although the association was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (p=0.12). Although these data cannot address the role of these genetic variants on lung cancer initiation or progression, we conclude that some selected Tibetan variants are strongly associated with a modified risk of lung cancer.",

The recent discovery that adult humans have metabolically active BAT has rekindled an interest in this intriguing tissue, with the overarching aim of manipulating BAT function to augment energy expenditure as a countermeasure for obesity and the metabolic abnormalities it incurs. Subsequently, there has been heightened interest in quantifying BAT function and more specifically, determining UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT specimens - including in those obtained from humans. In this article, BAT mitochondrial bioenergetics will be described and compared with more conventional mitochondria in other tissues.

Both brown adipose tissue (BAT) (<i>i.e.</i> uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-based) and skeletal muscle (<i>i.e.</i> sarcolipin (SLN)-based) thermogenesis processes play important roles in temperature homeostasis, but their relative contributions differ from small to large mammals. In this study, we investigated the functional interplay between skeletal muscle- and BAT-based thermogenesis under mild <i>versus</i> severe cold adaptation by employing UCP1<sup>-/-</sup> and SLN<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Interestingly, adaptation of SLN<sup>-/-</sup> mice to mild cold conditions (16 \u00b0C) significantly increased UCP1 expression, suggesting increased reliance on BAT-based thermogenesis. This was also evident from structural alterations in BAT morphology, including mitochondrial architecture, increased expression of electron transport chain proteins, and depletion of fat droplets. Similarly, UCP1<sup>-/-</sup> mice adapted to mild cold up-regulated muscle-based thermogenesis, indicated by increases in muscle succinate dehydrogenase activity, SLN expression, mitochondrial content, and neovascularization, compared with WT mice. These results further confirm that SLN-based thermogenesis is a key player in muscle non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) and can compensate for loss of BAT activity. We also present evidence that the increased reliance on BAT-based NST depends on increased autonomic input, as indicated by abundant levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y. Our findings demonstrate that both BAT and muscle-based NST are equally recruited during mild and severe cold adaptation and that loss of heat production from one thermogenic pathway leads to increased recruitment of the other, indicating a functional interplay between these two thermogenic processes.",

Because UCP3 properties regarding transport of protons are qualitatively identical to those of UCP1, its expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) alongside UCP1 requires justification. In this work, we tested whether any correlation exists between the expression of UCP1 and UCP3 in BAT by quantification of protein amounts in mouse tissues at physiological conditions, in cold-acclimated and UCP1 knockout mice. Quantification using recombinant UCP3 revealed that the UCP3 amount in BAT (0.51ng/(\u03bcg total tissue protein)) was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that in muscles and heart. Cold-acclimated mice showed an approximate three-fold increase in UCP3 abundance in BAT in comparison to mice in thermoneutral conditions. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease of UCP3 in BAT of UCP1 knockout mice, whereas the protein amount in skeletal and heart muscles remained constant. UCP3 abundance decreased even more in cold-acclimated UCP1 knockout mice. Protein quantification in UCP3 knockout mice revealed no compensatory increase in UCP1 or UCP2 expression. Our results do not support the participation of UCP3 in thermogenesis in the absence of UCP1 in BAT, but clearly demonstrate the correlation in abundance between both proteins. The latter is important for understanding UCP3's function in BAT.",

The molecular mechanisms regulating this activation have not been fully elucidated. The Janus kinase (JAK) - signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway mediates the signal transduction of numerous hormones and growth factors that regulate adipose tissue development and function, and may play a role in adaptive thermogenesis. We analysed mRNA and protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and JAK2 in different adipose depots in response to metabolic and thermal stress. The in vivo role of JAK2 in adaptive thermogenesis was examined using mice with adipocyte-specific Jak2 deficiency (A-Jak2 KO). We show in murine brown adipose tissue (BAT) that JAK2 is upregulated together with UCP1 in response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and cold exposure. In contrast to white adipose tissue, where JAK2 was dispensable for UCP1 induction, we identified an essential role for BAT JAK2 in diet- and cold-induced thermogenesis via mediating the thermogenic response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Accordingly, A-Jak2 KO mice were unable to upregulate BAT UCP1 following a HFD or after cold exposure. Therefore, A-Jak2 KO mice were cold intolerant and susceptible to HFD-induced obesity and diabetes. Taken together, our results suggest that JAK2 plays a critical role in BAT function and adaptive thermogenesis. Targeting the JAK-STAT pathway may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

We further identified mRNAs encoding novel markers, orphan GPCRs, and many receptors that bind the classic neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, chemokines, cytokines, and hormones. The transcriptome variability between BAs suggests a much larger range of responsiveness of BAT than previously recognized and that not all BAs function identically. We examined the in vivo functional expression of 12 selected receptors by microinjecting agonists into live mouse BAT and analyzing the metabolic response. In this manner, we expanded the number of known receptors on BAs at least 25-fold, while showing that the expression of classic BA markers is more complex and variable than previously thought.",

Among healthy males, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genetic variants linked to low in vitro transcription (MAOA-L) are associated with structural abnormalities of the amygdala and OFC. However, it is currently unknown whether amygdala and OFC morphology in ASPD relate to MAO-A genetic polymorphisms. We studied 18 ASPD males with a history of violent offending and 20 healthy male controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes to determine MAO-A genetic polymorphisms. Subjects underwent a T1-weighted MRI anatomical brain scan that provided vertex-wise measures of amygdala shape and surface area and OFC cortical thickness. We found that ASPD + PP subjects with MAOA-L exhibited decreased surface area in the right basolateral amygdala nucleus and increased surface area in the right anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus versus healthy MAOA-L carriers. This study is the first to describe genotype-related morphological differences of the amygdala in a population marked by high aggression. Deficits in emotional regulation that contribute to the violence of ASPD + PP may relate to morphological changes of the amygdala under genetic control.",

The interaction of the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA-L) gene and early childhood adversity has been shown to predict aggression in clinical and non-clinical populations. Although impulsivity is a risk factor for aggression in BPD and ASPD, little research has investigated potential gene-environment (G\u00d7E) influences impacting its expression in these conditions. Moreover, G\u00d7E interactions may differ by diagnosis. Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals: 20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. A group\u00d7genotype\u00d7abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, <i>p</i>=0.018), such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11 motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11 attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, <i>p</i>=0.025). These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD.",

All subjects were female. Severe BPD was associated with greater PFC and ACC MAO-A VT compared with moderate BPD, MDE, and healthy control subjects (multivariate analysis of variance group effect: F6,102 = 5.6, p &lt; .001).

Due to the X-chromosomal localization of the MAOA gene, psychobiological traits were compared separately for both genders of 298 male and 66 female alcoholics. In males, 30 of 59 alcoholics with antisocial personality disorder carried the low-activity 3-repeat allele in contrast to only 7 of 31 anxious-depressive alcoholics (51% vs. 23%; p = 0.02). Likewise, female anxious-depressive alcoholics showed a trend towards a low frequency of genotypes with the 3 repeat allele compared to female alcoholics without these symptoms (29% vs. 53%; p = 0.09).

Here, we assessed the low (MAOA-L) activity variant in relation to both brain function and a behavioral index of antisocial traits. From an initial sample of 290 healthy participants, 210 had low (MAOA-L) or high (MAOA-H) activity variants. Participants underwent a brief assessment of personality traits and event-related potential (ERP) recording during an emotion-processing task. Genotype differences in ERPs were localized using LORETA. The MAOA-L genotype was distinguished by elevated scores on the index of antisocial traits. These traits were related to altered ERPs elicited 120-280ms post-stimulus, particularly for negative emotion. Altered neural processing of anger in MAOA-L genotypes was localized to medial frontal, parietal, and superior temporo-occipital regions in males, but only to the superior occipital cortex in females. The MAOA low activity variant may increase susceptibility to antisocial traits through alterations to the neural systems for processing threat-related emotion, especially for males. Monoamines such as noradrenalin and serotonin may modulate these relationships, given that their metabolism varies according to MAOA variants, and that they modulate both emotional brain systems and antisocial aggression.",

Participants were 86 incarcerated participants with ASPD and 73 healthy controls. MAOA promoter methylation was compared between case and control groups. We explored the functional impact of MAOA promoter methylation on gene expression in vitro and blood 5-HT levels in a subset of the case group. Results suggest that MAOA promoter hypermethylation is associated with ASPD and may contribute to downregulation of MAOA gene expression, as indicated by functional assays in vitro, and regression analysis with whole-blood serotonin levels in offenders with ASPD. These results are consistent with prior literature suggesting MAOA and serotonergic dysregulation in antisocial populations.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17347351": "The physiological changes of adolescence may promote risk-taking behaviors, including binge drinking. Approximately 40% of alcoholics were already drinking heavily in late adolescence. Most cases of alcoholism are established by the age of 30 years with the peak prevalence at 18-23 years of age. Therefore the key time frame for the development, and prevention, of alcoholism lies in adolescence and young adulthood. Severe childhood stressors have been associated with increased vulnerability to addiction, however, not all stress-exposed children go on to develop alcoholism. Origins of resilience can be both genetic (variation in alcohol-metabolizing genes, increased susceptibility to alcohol's sedative effects) and environmental (lack of alcohol availability, positive peer and parental support). Genetic vulnerability is likely to be conferred by multiple genes of small to modest effects, possibly only apparent in gene-environment interactions. For example, it has been shown that childhood maltreatment interacts with a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene variant to predict antisocial behavior that is often associated with alcoholism, and an interaction between early life stress and a serotonin transporter promoter variant predicts alcohol abuse in nonhuman primates and depression in humans. In addition, a common Met158 variant in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene can confer both risk and resilience to alcoholism in different drinking environments. It is likely that a complex mix of gene(s)-environment(s) interactions underlie addiction vulnerability and development. Risk-resilience factors can best be determined in longitudinal studies, preferably starting during pregnancy. This kind of research is important for planning future measures to prevent harmful drinking in adolescence.",

Forty-five unrelated male monkeys raised with or without their mothers were tested for competitive and social group aggression. Functional activity of the MAOA gene promoter polymorphism was determined and genotypes scored for assessing genetic and environmental influences on aggression. Transcription of the MAOA gene in rhesus monkeys is modulated by an orthologous polymorphism (rhMAOA-LPR) in its upstream regulatory region. High- and low-activity alleles of the rhMAOA-LPR show a genotype x environment interaction effect on aggressive behavior, such that mother-reared male monkeys with the low-activity-associated allele had higher aggression scores.

Here, we have analyzed the presence and variability of this MAOA promoter repeat in several species of nonhuman primates. Sequence analysis of MAOA's transcriptional control region revealed the presence of the VNTR in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and Gelada baboon (Theropithecus gelada). The majority of P. troglodytes and P. paniscus showed a single repeat with a sequence identical to the VNTR sequence in humans.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of platelet MAO-B activity, MAOB rs1799836 polymorphism and MAOA uVNTR polymorphism with severe agitation in 363 subjects with schizophrenia and conduct disorder. The results demonstrated significant association of severe agitation and smoking, but not diagnosis or age, with platelet MAO-B activity. Higher platelet MAO-B activity was found in subjects with severe agitation compared to non-agitated subjects. Platelet MAO-B activity was not associated with MAOB rs1799836 polymorphism. These results suggested the association between increased platelet MAO-B activity and severe agitation. No significant association was found between severe agitation and MAOA uVNTR or MAOB rs1799836 polymorphism, revealing that these individual polymorphisms in MAO genes are not related to severe agitation in subjects with schizophrenia and conduct disorder.

In prefrontal cortex, low MAOA binding is associated with aggression and high binding is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and also risk for recurrence of depressive episodes. In rodent models, low MAOA levels are associated with increased aggression and fear conditioning, and decreased social and exploratory investigative behaviors. Our objective was to measure MAOA binding in prefrontal cortex and concurrently evaluate a broad range of validated personality traits. We hypothesized that prefrontal MAOA binding would correlate negatively with angry-hostility, a trait related to aggression/anger, and positively with traits intuitively related to adaptive investigative behavior. Participants were aged 19-49 years, healthy and non-smoking. MAOA binding was measured with [11C]harmine positron emission tomography (PET) in prefrontal brain regions and personality traits were measured with the NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO PI-R). Prefrontal MAOA binding correlated negatively with angry-hostility (r=-0.515, p=0.001) and positively with deliberation (r=0.514, p=0.001). In a two-factor regression model, these facets explained 38% of variance in prefrontal MAOA binding. A similar relationship was found in prefrontal cortex subregions. We propose a new continuum describing the relationship between personality and MAOA: deliberate/thoughtful contrasting aggressive/impulsive. Additionally, the association between high MAOA binding and greater deliberation may explain why some people have moderately high levels of MAOA, although very high levels occur during MDD. In health, higher MAOA binding is associated with an adaptive personality facet.",

However, although HDAC proteins have shown to be expressed in the developing vertebrate neural tube, their specific role in CNS neural progenitor fate specification remains unclear. Prior work from our lab showed that the Tcf7l2/Tcf4 transcription factor plays a key role in ventral progenitor lineage segregation by differential repression of two key specification factors, Nkx2.2 and Olig2. In this study, we found that administration of HDAC inhibitors (Valproic Acid (VPA), Trichostatin-A (TSA), or sodium butyrate) in chick embryos in ovo disrupted normal progenitor gene segregation in the developing neural tube, indicating that HDAC activity is required for this process. Further, using functional and pharmacological approaches in vivo, we found that HDAC activity is required for the differential repression of Nkx2.2 and Olig2 by Tcf7l2/Tcf4. Finally, using dominant-negative functional assays, we provide evidence that Tcf7l2/Tcf4 repression also requires Gro/TLE/Grg co-repressor factors. Together, our data support a model where the transcriptional repressor activity of Tcf7l2/Tcf4 involves functional interactions with both HDAC and Gro/TLE/Grg co-factors at specific target gene regulatory elements in the developing neural tube, and that this activity is required for the proper segregation of the Nkx2.2 (p3) and Olig2 (pMN) expressing cells from a common progenitor pool.",

This probe, designated SAHA-BPyne, contains structural elements of the general HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), as well as benzophenone and alkyne moieties to effect covalent modification and enrichment of HDACs, respectively. Both class I and II HDACs were identified as specific targets of SAHA-BPyne in proteomes. Interestingly, multiple HDAC-associated proteins were also enriched by SAHA-BPyne, even after denaturation of probe-labeled proteomes. These data indicate that certain HDAC-associated proteins are directly modified by SAHA-BPyne, placing them in close proximity to HDAC active sites where they would be primed to regulate substrate recognition and activity. We further show that SAHA-BPyne can be used to measure differences in HDAC content and complex assembly in human disease models.

These can be categorized into two classes: the first class represented by yeast Rpd3-like proteins and the second by yeast Hda1-like proteins. Human HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 proteins are members of the first class, whereas no class II human HDAC proteins had been identified. The amino acid sequence of Hda1p was used to search the GenBank/expressed sequence tag databases to identify partial sequences from three putative class II human HDAC proteins. The corresponding full-length cDNAs were cloned and defined as HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC6. These proteins possess certain features present in the conserved catalytic domains of class I human HDACs, but also contain additional sequence domains. Interestingly, HDAC6 contains an internal duplication of two catalytic domains, which appear to function independently of each other. These class II HDAC proteins have differential mRNA expression in human tissues and possess in vitro HDAC activity that is inhibited by trichostatin A. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that these HDAC proteins are not components of the previously identified HDAC1 and HDAC2 NRD and mSin3A complexes. However, HDAC4 and HDAC5 associate with HDAC3 in vivo. This finding suggests that the human class II HDAC enzymes may function in cellular processes distinct from those of HDAC1 and HDAC2.",

This liberates positive charges on the histone tail and allows for tighter winding of DNA, preventing transcription factor binding and gene activation. Although the functions of HDAC proteins are becoming apparent both biochemically and clinically, how this class of proteins is regulated remains poorly understood. We identified a novel interaction between nuclear actin and HDAC 1 and HDAC 2. Nuclear actin has been previously shown to interact with a growing list of nuclear proteins including chromatin remodeling complexes, transcription factors and RNA polymerases. We find that monomeric actin is able to bind the class I HDAC complex. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of actin in HeLa nuclear extracts was able to suppress overall HDAC function. Conversely, polymerizing nuclear actin increased HDAC activity and decreased histone acetylation. Moreover, the interaction between class I HDACs and nuclear actin was found to be activity dependent. Together, our data suggest nuclear actin is able to regulate HDAC 1 and 2 activity.",

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl transferases catalyze the reversible acetylation of histones and nonhistone substrates to control the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of normal and tumor cells. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors results in the hyperacetylation of chaperones including heat shock protein (hsp)90, hsp70, hsp40, and the ER-resident hsp70 homolog, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which affects their function. HDAC inhibitor-mediated deregulation of chaperone function, in turn, deregulates protein homeostasis and induces protein misfolding and proteotoxic stress. In the context of tumors which are particularly dependent on functional chaperones for maintaining protein homeostasis, HDAC inhibitors tip the balance toward lethal proteotoxic and ER stress. In this chapter, we describe HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation of major chaperones and its implication for the use of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of solid and hematologic tumors.",

Recent studies indicate that some HDACs can act on non-histone proteins as well. Interest in these enzymes is growing because HDAC inhibitors appear to be promising therapeutic agents against cancer and a variety of other diseases. Thus far, 11 members of the HDAC family have been identified in humans, but few have been characterized in detail. To better define the biological function of these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1, class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group \"class 4\" to distinguish it from the unrelated \"class 3\" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC proteins. All three HDAC classes (including class 4) exist in eubacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial HDAC relatives suggests that all three HDAC classes precede the evolution of histone proteins and raises the possibility that the primary activity of some \"histone deacetylase\" enzymes is directed against non-histone substrates.",

The latter process is mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Previous analysis of the regulation of HDAC activity in transcription has focused primarily on the recruitment of HDAC proteins to specific promoters or chromosomal domains by association with DNA-binding proteins. To characterize the cellular function of the recently identified HDAC4 and HDAC5 proteins, complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Both HDACs were found to interact with14-3-3 proteins at three phosphorylation sites. The association of 14-3-3 with HDAC4 and HDAC5 results in the sequestration of these proteins in the cytoplasm. Loss of this interaction allows HDAC4 and HDAC5 to translocate to the nucleus, interact with HDAC3, and repress gene expression. Regulation of the cellular localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by 14-3-3 represents a mechanism for controlling the transcriptional activity of these class II HDAC proteins.",

Regulation of chromatin structure is controlled by histone modifications that directly influence chromatin architecture and genome function. Specifically, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of proteins modulate chromatin compaction and are commonly dysregulated in many tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role of HDAC proteins in early colorectal carcinogenesis has not been previously reported. We found HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC5, and HDAC7 all to be up-regulated in the field of human CRC. Furthermore, we observed that HDAC2 up-regulation is one of the earliest events in CRC carcinogenesis and observed this in human field carcinogenesis, the azoxymethane-treated rat model, and in more aggressive colon cancer cell lines. The universality of HDAC2 up-regulation suggests that HDAC2 up-regulation is a novel and important early event in CRC, which may serve as a biomarker. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) interfere with tumorigenic HDAC activity; however, the precise mechanisms involved in this process remain to be elucidated. We confirmed that HDAC inhibition by valproic acid (VPA) targeted the more aggressive cell line. Using nuclease digestion assays and transmission electron microscopy imaging, we observed that VPA treatment induced greater changes in chromatin structure in the more aggressive cell line. Furthermore, we used the novel imaging technique partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) to quantify nanoscale alterations in chromatin. We noted that the PWS results are consistent with the biological assays, indicating a greater effect of VPA treatment in the more aggressive cell type. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of HDAC activity in early carcinogenic events and the unique role of higher-order chromatin structure in determining cell tumorigenicity.",

Specifically, histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins repress transcription by deacetylating histones. To date, the only known regulatory mechanism of HDAC1 function is via interaction with associated proteins. Although the control of HDAC1 function by protein interaction and recruitment is well precedented, we were interested in exploring HDAC1 regulation by post-translational modification. Human HDAC1 protein was analyzed by ion trap mass spectrometry, and two phosphorylated serine residues, Ser(421) and Ser(423), were unambiguously identified. Loss of phosphorylation at Ser(421) and Ser(423) due to mutation to alanine or disruption of the casein kinase 2 consensus sequence directing phosphorylation reduced the enzymatic activity and complex formation of HDAC1. Deletion of the highly charged carboxyl-terminal region of HDAC1 also decreased its deacetylase activity and protein associations, revealing its requirement in maintaining HDAC1 function. Our results reinforce the importance of protein associations in modulating HDAC1 function and provide the first step toward characterizing the role of post-translational modifications in regulating HDAC activity in vivo.",

To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide, we used H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which revealed that 5% of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric histone-DNA interactions. These asymmetric interactions are enriched at nucleosome positions that flank promoters. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in MNase protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of DNA contacts around H4S47 is accompanied by protection of the DNA from MNase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation mapping of selected nucleosome remodelers indicated that asymmetric nucleosomes are bound by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, which is required for maintaining nucleosomes at asymmetric positions. These results imply that the asymmetric nucleosome-RSC complex is a metastable intermediate representing partial unwrapping and protection of nucleosomal DNA on one side of the dyad axis during chromatin remodeling.",

To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages, as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence.

H3 nucleosomes are nearly absent from the central domain, which is occupied by centromere-specific H3 (cenH3 or CENP-A) nucleosomes with two H4s per particle that are mostly unpositioned and are more widely spaced than nucleosomes elsewhere. Inner kinetochore proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-T, CENP-I, and Scm3 are highly enriched throughout the central domain except at tRNA genes, with no evidence for preferred kinetochore assembly sites. These proteins are weakly enriched and less stably incorporated in H3-rich heterochromatin. CENP-A nucleosomes protect less DNA from nuclease digestion than H3 nucleosomes, while CENP-T protects a range of fragment sizes. Our results suggest that CENP-T particles occupy linkers between CENP-A nucleosomes and that classical regional centromeres differ from other centromeres by the absence of CENP-A nucleosome positioning.",

Pol \u03b8 is the defining enzyme for a pathway of DSB repair termed \"alternative end-joining\" (altEJ) or \"theta-mediated end-joining.\" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events. Pol \u03b8 is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures of pol \u03b8 bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol \u03b8 (2590 residues in humans) and unusual juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase, separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize work on the expression and purification of the full-length protein, and then focus on the design, expression, and purification of an active C-terminal polymerase fragment. The generation of this active construct was nontrivial and time consuming. Almost all published biochemical work to date has been performed with this domain fragment. Strategies to obtain and improve crystals of a ternary pol \u03b8 complex (enzyme:DNA:nucleotide) are also presented, along with key elements of the structure.",

Pol \u03b8 is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol \u03b8 is important in the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol \u03b8 participates in a route of DSB repair termed \"alternative end-joining\" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex and requires DNA end resection. Pol \u03b8 is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. \"Signatures\" of Pol \u03b8 action during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining employs the ability of Pol \u03b8 to tightly grasp a 3' terminus through unique contacts in the active site, allowing extension from minimally paired primers. Pol \u03b8 is involved in controlling the frequency of chromosome translocations and preserves genome integrity by limiting large deletions. It may also play a backup role in DNA base excision repair.

However, potential of the therapy for DMD at different stages of the disease progression is not understood. In this study, we examined the effect of peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO)-mediated exon skipping on disease progression of utrophin-dystrophin-deficient mice (dko) of four age groups (21-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50+ days), representing diseases from early stage to advanced stage with severe kyphosis. Biweekly intravenous (i.v.) administration of the PPMO restored the dystrophin expression in nearly 100% skeletal muscle fibers in all age groups. This was associated with the restoration of dystrophin-associated proteins including functional glycosylated dystroglycan and neuronal nitric synthase. However, therapeutic outcomes clearly depended on severity of the disease at the time the treatment started. The PPMO treatment alleviated the disease pathology and significantly prolonged the life span of the mice receiving treatment at younger age with mild phenotype. However, restoration of high levels of dystrophin expression failed to prevent disease progression to the mice receiving treatment when disease was already at advanced stage. The results could be critical for design of clinical trials with antisense therapy to DMD.",

Few studies have examined the pathophysiological changes that occur in humans during YFV infection due to the sporadic nature and remote locations of outbreaks. Rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to YFV infection, providing a robust animal model to investigate host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we characterized disease progression as well as alterations in immune system homeostasis, cytokine production and gene expression in rhesus macaques infected with the virulent YFV strain DakH1279 (YFV-DakH1279). Following infection, YFV-DakH1279 replicated to high titers resulting in viscerotropic disease with \u223c72% mortality. Data presented in this manuscript demonstrate for the first time that lethal YFV infection results in profound lymphopenia that precedes the hallmark changes in liver enzymes and that although tissue damage was noted in liver, kidneys, and lymphoid tissues, viral antigen was only detected in the liver. These observations suggest that additional tissue damage could be due to indirect effects of viral replication. Indeed, circulating levels of several cytokines peaked shortly before euthanasia. Our study also includes the first description of YFV-DakH1279-induced changes in gene expression within peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3 days post-infection prior to any clinical signs. These data show that infection with wild type YFV-DakH1279 or live-attenuated vaccine strain YFV-17D, resulted in 765 and 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. DEGs detected after YFV-17D infection were mostly associated with innate immunity, whereas YFV-DakH1279 infection resulted in dysregulation of genes associated with the development of immune response, ion metabolism, and apoptosis.

Due to the heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), further identification of tumor cell types should be accompanied with CTCs isolation from blood cells in peripheral blood sample. Both negative enrichment and recollection of isolated CTCs are required in the downstream analysis, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and massive equipment required. To solve these limitations, we have developed a simple and disposable spiral shape microfluidic channel that can separate all CTCs from blood cells, and at the same time, can identify the types of CTCs based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression level. Two different types of tumor cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, both from the same origin of breast carcinoma cells, were used to demonstrate the functionality of the developed system. The spiral channel system could capture the EpCAM positive and negative CTCs with 96.3% and 81.2% purity, respectively, while both EpCAM positive and negative CTCs were differently positioned along the microfluidic channel. The average selectivity of EpCAM positive and negative CTCs is 6.1:4.8. In addition, the throughput of the system was optimized at a sample flow rate of 150\u00b5l/min. The developed system successfully demonstrated its potential to identify biomarkers, including EpCAM, for detecting the heterogenic CTCs.",

Greater than 95% of breast malignancies are of epithelial origin; the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to initiate the metastatic process in breast carcinoma and remains the key target for drug development. Here, we examine the anti-metastatic potential of pterostilbene in modulating EMT process in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The differential invasive ability among MCF7, Hs578t and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were closely correlated with the expression of EMT markers, determined by Western blots and Matrigel-coated transwells assay. Pterostilbene inhibited the migratory and invasive potential of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t cells, accompanied by the up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of Snail, Slug, vimentin and ZEB1. Mechanistic investigations revealed a significant up-regulation of miR-205, which resulted in the reduction of Src expression in pterostilbene-treated breast cancer cells. Importantly, pterostilbene suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in MDA-MB-231-bearing NOD/SCID mice by reducing Src/Fak signaling; this observation was consistent with the negative correlations between miR-205 and Src expression in both normal and malignant breast tissues. Our findings provide supports for the usage of pterostilbene as an inhibitor of EMT process and potential candidate for adjuvant therapy.",

Although fibrocytes promote collagen production by fibroblasts, little is known about signaling from fibroblasts to fibrocytes. In this report, we show that fibroblasts stimulated with the fibrocyte-secreted inflammatory signal tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 secrete the small leucine-rich proteoglycan lumican, and that lumican, but not the related proteoglycan decorin, promotes human fibrocyte differentiation. Lumican competes with the serum fibrocyte differentiation inhibitor serum amyloid P, but dominates over the fibroblast-secreted fibrocyte inhibitor Slit2. Lumican acts directly on monocytes, and unlike other factors that affect fibrocyte differentiation, lumican has no detectable effect on macrophage differentiation or polarization. \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b1M\u03b22, and \u03b1X\u03b22 integrins are needed for lumican-induced fibrocyte differentiation. In lung tissue from pulmonary fibrosis patients with relatively normal lung function, lumican is present at low levels throughout the tissue, whereas patients with advanced disease have pronounced lumican expression in the fibrotic lesions. These data may explain why fibrocytes are increased in fibrotic tissues, suggest that the levels of lumican in tissues may have a significant effect on the decision of monocytes to differentiate into fibrocytes, and indicate that modulating lumican signaling may be useful as a therapeutic for fibrosis.",

Lumican-transfected PANC-1 cells secreted a 70-kDa lumican protein and had an active ERK pathway. Transfection stimulated PANC-1 cell growth, increased cell adhesion to laminin, inhibited cell invasion, and decreased active matrix metalloproteinase-9. Down-regulation of lumican using siRNA resulted in opposite cell behavior. Thus, the 70-kDa lumican secreted by PDAC cells plays important roles in cell growth and invasion.",

Lumican, a small extracellular matrix leucine-rich proteoglycan, has been shown to inhibit human melanoma cell migration by binding to \u03b12\u03b21 integrin and affecting actin cytoskeleton organization. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lumican overexpression on the migration ability of human colon adenocarcinoma LS180 cells. The cells stably transfected with plasmid containing lumican cDNA were characterized by the increased chemotactic migration measured on Transwell filters. Lumican-overexpressing cells presented the elevated filamentous to monomeric actin ratio and gelsolin up-regulation. This was accompanied by a distinct cytoskeletal actin rearrangement and gelsolin subcellular relocation, as observed under laser scaning confocal microscope. Moreover, LS180 cells overexpressing lumican tend to form podosome-like structures as indicated by vinculin redistribution and its colocalization with gelsolin and actin at the submembrane region of the cells. In conclusion, the elevated level of lumican secretion to extracellular space leads to actin cytoskeletal remodeling followed by an increase in migration capacity of human colon LS180 cells. These data suggest that lumican expression and its presence in ECM has an impact on colon cancer cells motility and may modulate invasiveness of colon cancer.",

Within the PDAC tumor microenvironment, activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) are the dominant stromal cell type and responsible for collagen deposition. Lumican is a secreted proteoglycan that regulates collagen fibril assembly. We have previously identified that the presence of lumican in the ECM surrounding PDAC cells is associated with improved patient outcome after multimodal therapy and surgical removal of localized PDAC. Lumican expression in PDAC from 27 patients was determined by IHC and quantitatively analyzed for colocalization with PSCs. In vitro studies examined the molecular mechanisms of lumican transcription and secretion from PSCs (HPSCs and HPaSteC), and cell adhesion and migration assays examined the effect of lumican on PSCs in a collagen-rich environment. Here we identify PSCs as a significant source of extracellular lumican production through quantitative IHC analysis. We demonstrate that the cytokine, TGF-\u03b2, negatively regulates lumican gene transcription within HPSCs through its canonical signaling pathway and binding of SMAD4 to novel SBEs identified within the promoter region. In addition, we found that the ability of HPSCs to produce and secrete extracellular lumican significantly enhances HPSCs adhesion and mobility on collagen. Our results demonstrate that activated pancreatic stellate cells within PDAC secrete lumican under the negative control of TGF-\u03b2; once secreted, the extracellular lumican enhances stellate cell adhesion and mobility in a collagen-rich environment.

The role of a keratan sulphate SLRP lumican, has recently been investigated in the growth and metastasis of several cancers. In this study, the expression of lumican was studied in two human melanoma cell lines (WM9, M5) as well as in normal neonatal human melanocytes (HEMN) using real time PCR, western blotting with antibodies against the protein core and keratan sulfate, and treatments with specific enzymes. Both human metastatic melanoma cell lines were found to express lumican mRNA and effectively secrete lumican in a proteoglycan form, characterized to be substituted mostly with keratan sulfate chains. Lumican mRNA was not detected in normal melanocytes. This is the first time that the synthesis and secretion of lumican in human melanoma cell lines is reported.

Considering the importance of combining antiretrovirals for their optimal use in treating HIV, a number of drug-drug interactions with etravirine and other antiretrovirals have been evaluated. Etravirine is a weak inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9/CYP2C19 and P-glycoprotein, and although etravirine is metabolized by the CYP enzyme system, the extent of clinically relevant interactions with other antiretrovirals is limited. Etravirine can be combined with all currently available nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors without dose adjustments, but not with other NNRTIs. Available data indicate that etravirine can be coadministered with most of the currently available ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors. Coadministration with tipranavir/ritonavir or unboosted HIV protease inhibitors is not recommended because of clinically relevant changes in exposure to etravirine or the coadministered HIV protease inhibitor, respectively. Etravirine can be coadministered with the integrase inhibitors elvitegravir/ritonavir or raltegravir, and with the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, without dose adjustments. Dose adjustment of the C-C chemokine receptor type-5 antagonist maraviroc is required, with the type of adjustment depending on whether a boosted HIV protease inhibitor is included in the regimen.

These regions are highly copy number polymorphic between and within species, and copy number differences involving hundreds of copies can be accurately estimated by assaying read-depth of next-generation sequencing data sets. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses suggest that the structures have arisen largely independently in the two lineages with the exception of a few seed sequences present in the common ancestor of humans and African apes. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin.

This has been confirmed by chromosome banding and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with human chromosome-2-specific DNA libraries. In this study, the order of 38 cosmid clones derived from the human chromosome region 2q12-q14 was exactly determined by high-resolution FISH in human chromosome 2 and its homologous chromosomes in chimpanzees (Pan trogrodydes, 2n=48) and cynomolgus monkeys (Macacafascicularis, 2n = 42). This region includes the telomere-to-telomere fusion point of two ancestral ape-type chromosomes. As a result of comparative mapping, human chromosome region 2q12-q14 was found to correspond to the short arms of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13 and cynomolgus monkey chromosomes 9 and 15. It is noted that no difference was detected in the relative order of the cosmid clones between human and chimpanzee chromosomes. This suggests that two ancestral ape-type chromosomes fused tandemly at telomeres to form human chromosome 2, and the genomic organization of this region is thought to be considerably conserved. In the cynomolgus monkey, however, the order of clones in each homologue was inverted. In addition to cosmid mapping, two chromosome-2-specific yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones containing the fusion point were identified by FISH.",

Unlike the site of fusion, which is enriched for sequences that are shared elsewhere in the human genome, the region of the nonfunctioning and degenerate ancestral centromere appears to share limited similarity with other sites in the human genome, thereby providing an opportunity to study this genomic arrangement in short, fragmented ancient DNA genomic datasets. Here, chromosome-assigned satellite DNAs are used to study shared centromere sequence organization in Denisovan and Neandertal genomes. By doing so, one is able to provide evidence for the presence of both active and degenerate centromeric satellite profiles on chromosome 2 in these archaic genomes, supporting the hypothesis that the chromosomal fusion event took place prior to our last common ancestor with Denisovan and Neandertal hominins and presenting a genomic reference for predicting karyotype in ancient genomic datasets.",

Due to the presence of two primary constrictions, they are inherently unstable and overcome their instability by epigenetically inactivating and/or deleting one of the two centromeres, thus resulting in functionally monocentric chromosomes that segregate normally during cell division. Our understanding to date of dicentric chromosome formation, behavior and fate has been largely inferred from observational studies in plants and humans as well as artificially produced de novo dicentrics in yeast and in human cells. We investigate the most recent product of a chromosome fusion event fixed in the human lineage, human chromosome 2, whose stability was acquired by the suppression of one centromere, resulting in a unique difference in chromosome number between humans (46 chromosomes) and our most closely related ape relatives (48 chromosomes). Using molecular cytogenetics, sequencing, and comparative sequence data, we deeply characterize the relicts of the chromosome 2q ancestral centromere and its flanking regions, gaining insight into the ancestral organization that can be easily broadened to all acrocentric chromosome centromeres. Moreover, our analyses offered the opportunity to trace the evolutionary history of rDNA and satellite III sequences among great apes, thus suggesting a new hypothesis for the preferential inactivation of some human centromeres, including IIq. Our results suggest two possible centromere inactivation models to explain the evolutionarily stabilization of human chromosome 2 over the last 5-6 million years.

In contrast to several intrachromosomal rearrangements, only two evolutionary translocations have been identified by cytogenetic analyses of humans and greater apes. Human chromosome 2 arose as a result of a telomeric fusion between acrocentric chromosomes, whereas chromosomes 4 and 19 in Gorilla gorilla are the products of a reciprocal translocation between ancestral chromosomes, syntenic to human chromosomes 5 and 17, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to characterize the breakpoints of the latter translocation at the molecular level. We identified three BAC clones that span translocation breakpoints. One breakpoint occurred in the region syntenic to human chromosome 5q13.3, between the HMG-CoA reductase gene (HMGCR) and RAS p21 protein activator 1 gene (RASA1). The second breakpoint was in a region syntenic to human chromosome 17p12 containing the 24 kb region-specific low-copy repeat-proximal CMT1A-REP. Moreover, we found that the t(4;19) is associated with a submicroscopic chromosome duplication involving a 19p chromosome fragment homologous to the human chromosome region surrounding the proximal CMT1A-REP.

Furthermore, we examined which cell-surface proteins are suitable as a target for non-invasive tumor-specific imaging of ovarian metastases from invasive breast cancer. Using the nationwide database of the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), we identified a cohort of 46 women with primary invasive breast cancer and ovarian metastases. The localization and morphology of ovarian metastases were determined on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. The following cell-surface markers were immunohistochemically analyzed: E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), human epidermal growth receptor type 2 (Her2/neu), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The majority of ovarian metastases (71%) consisted of a solitary metastasis or multiple distinct nodules separated by uninvolved ovarian tissue, suggesting that ovarian metastases might be overlooked by the current detection approach. Combining the targets E-cadherin, EMA and Her2/neu resulted in nearly 100% detection of ductal ovarian metastases, whereas the combination of EMA, Her2/neu and EpCAM was most suitable to detect lobular ovarian metastases. Examination of the actual ovarian transplants is recommended. A combination of targets is most appropriate to detect ovarian metastases by tumor-specific imaging.",

The present review focuses on the role of EpCAM in physiology and homeostasis of epithelia. Recent research pointed to a close interaction of EpCAM with other cell-cell contact molecules like E-cadherin and claudins and an intimate crosstalk with Wnt and TGF-beta signaling in the regulation of cell growth. Moreover, EpCAM has been shown to modulate trans-epithelial migration processes of white blood cells. Mutations of the EpCAM gene lead to disturbances of epithelial homeostasis and cellular differentiation from the stem cell compartment. In the intestinal tract EpCAM mutations contribute to congenital tufting enteropathy. Regarding tumorigenesis EpCAM can act as an oncogene still depending on additional driver mutations and epithelial phenotype of tumor cells. Tumor cells display increased EpCAM expression that often correlates with the loss of strict basolateral localization. Many tumors show enhanced regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of EpCAM and loose EpCAM expression under conditions of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The resulting extracellular EpEX and intracellular EpICD fragments mediate proliferative signals to the cell. Resulting fragments can be validated either by sensitive enzyme-linked immune-sandwich assays (EpEX) or by immunohistochemistry (EpICD).

In all of the 24 cases of papillary hyperplasia, EpCAM was located on the cell membrane, while in the 91 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma studied, EpCAM was located within the cytoplasm, with 36.3% (33/91) showing nuclear localization as well. In all the papillary hyperplasia cases studied, E-cadherin showed membranous expression. E-cadherin expression was reduced in 84.6% (77/91) of papillary thyroid carcinoma, as compared with the surrounding native thyroid parenchyma. Amongst the 33 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma which showed nuclear localization of EpCAM, 30 cases also showed reduced E-cadherin expression. There was a positive correlation between nuclear expression of EpCAM and loss of E-cadherin expression (P = 0.000; Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.857). Nuclear expression of EpCAM correlated with follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma and presence of extrathyroidal extension ( P = 0.037 and 0.033, respectively). Loss of E-cadherin expression correlated with age of patients and presence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.018 and 0.010, respectively). E-cadherin expression is reduced in papillary thyroid carcinoma, as compared with native thyroid parenchyma and papillary hyperplasia. Papillary thyroid carcinoma shows loss of EpCAM membranous expression and increased cytoplasmic/nuclear accumulation.

EpCAM accumulated on the lateral interfaces of human colon carcinoma and normal intestinal epithelial cells but did not co-localize with TJ. Knockdown of EpCAM in T84 and Caco-2 cells using shRNAs led to changes in morphology and adhesiveness. TJ formed readily after EpCAM knockdown; the acquisition of trans-epithelial electroresistance was enhanced, and TJ showed increased resistance to disruption by calcium chelation. Preparative immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EpCAM bound tightly to claudin-7. Co-immunoprecipitation documented associations of EpCAM with claudin-7 and claudin-1 but not claudin-2 or claudin-4. Claudin-1 associated with claudin-7 in co-transfection experiments, and claudin-7 was required for association of claudin-1 with EpCAM. EpCAM knockdown resulted in decreases in claudin-7 and claudin-1 proteins that were reversed with lysosome inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that claudin-7 and claudin-1 continually trafficked into lysosomes. Although EpCAM knockdown decreased claudin-1 and claudin-7 protein levels overall, accumulations of claudin-1 and claudin-7 in TJ increased. Physical interactions between EpCAM and claudins were required for claudin stabilization. These findings suggest that EpCAM modulates adhesion and TJ function by regulating intracellular localization and degradation of selected claudins.",

During liver development, EpCAM demonstrates a dynamic expression, since it can be detected in fetal liver, including cells of the parenchyma, whereas mature hepatocytes are devoid of EpCAM. Liver regeneration is associated with a population of EpCAM-positive cells within ductular reactions, which gradually lose the expression of EpCAM along with maturation into hepatocytes. EpCAM can be switched on and off through a wide panel of strategies to fine-tune EpCAM-dependent functional and differentiative traits. EpCAM-associated functions relate to cell-cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of a pluripotent state, regulation of differentiation, migration, and invasion. These functions can be conferred by the full-length protein and/or EpCAM-derived fragments, which are generated upon regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Control by EpCAM therefore not only depends on the presence of full-length EpCAM at cellular membranes but also on varying rates of the formation of EpCAM-derived fragments that have their own regulatory properties and on changes in the association of EpCAM with interaction partners. Thus spatiotemporal localization of EpCAM in immature liver progenitors, transit-amplifying cells, and mature liver cells will decisively impact the regulation of EpCAM functions and might be one of the triggers that contributes to the adaptive processes in stem/progenitor cell lineages. This review will summarize EpCAM-related molecular events and how they relate to hepatobiliary differentiation and regeneration.",

An immunotoxin (scFv2A9-PE or APE) was constructed by genetically fusing a truncated form (PE38KDEL) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin with an anti-EpCAM single-chain variable fragment (scFv). ELISA and flow cytometry were performed to verify immunotoxin (scFv2A9-PE or APE) antigen-binding activity with EpCAM. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay. Confocal microscopy was used to observe its cellular localization. The results of ELISA and flow cytometry revealed that the immunotoxin efficiently recognized recombinant and natural EpCAM. Its antigen-binding activity was relatively lower than 2A9. MTT assay confirmed potent reduction in EpCAM-positive HHCC (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cell viability (IC50 50 pM). Immunofluorescence revealed that the immunotoxin localized to endoplasmic reticulum 24 h later.

Trypsin-like serine proteases exhibit a highly similar tertiary folding pattern, especially for the region near the substrate binding pocket that includes the conserved catalytic triad consisting of histidine 57, aspartic acid 102, and serine 195. A rich collection of X-ray structures for many trypsin-like serine proteases is available, which greatly facilitated the optimization of small organic inhibitors as therapeutic agents. The present review surveyed those inhibitors disclosed in peer-reviewed scientific journals and patent publications with a special focus on structural features and protein-inhibitor interactions that implicated the inhibitor optimization process. The role played by the residue 190 of trypsin-like serine proteases is critical. While many inhibitors without a basic group have progressed into the clinic for ones with alanine 190, the task for those with serine 190 remains extremely challenging, if not impossible. In addition to warfarin, heparin, and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), treatment options have expanded with the development and approval of the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The NOACs are superior to vitamin K antagonists in terms of rapid onset, pharmacokinetics, drug/food interactions, and regular coagulation monitoring; but one serious drawback is the lack of an effective antidote at this time. Apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. FDA and are in current clinical practice. These drugs bind to the active site of factor Xa (fXa) which prevents the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. In addition, dabigatran etexikate (Pradaxa), the direct thrombin inhibitor (fIIa) is also now widely prescribed.",

In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke, apixaban recipients were significantly less likely than warfarin recipients to experience stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding or death; the beneficial effects of treatment with apixaban versus warfarin were generally maintained across various patient subgroups. Apixaban recipients also had a significantly lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage than warfarin recipients. In the AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients who have Failed or are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Therapy) trial in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable, apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism than aspirin, without an increase in the risk of major bleeding. In conclusion, although longer-term efficacy and safety data are needed, apixaban is an important new option for use in patients with nonvalvular AF to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism.",

Anticoagulation therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism is critical in patients with AF who are at risk of stroke. Warfarin has been an efficacious anticoagulant for this purpose, but its use has been limited by frequent laboratory monitoring, drug interactions, unpredictable individual response, delayed onset of action, and bleeding. Apixaban is the second oral direct selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. It was significantly better than aspirin in reducing stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism without increasing the risk of major bleeding in patients with AF who were at increased risk of stroke and for whom warfarin was unsuitable. In a randomized, double-blind trial that was originally designed to test for noninferiority, apixaban was superior to warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2-3) in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality in patients with AF. Apixaban has a half-life of about 12 hours, and the normal dosage is 5 mg orally twice daily. However, it may be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily based on individual factors of the patient (age, renal function, and body weight) and the concomitant use of potent dual inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Similar to other novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran and rivaroxaban), apixaban has no reversal agent for its anticoagulant effect.

New orally active anticoagulants have been available for a few years now. These specific substances directly block either thrombin (e.g., dabigatran etexilate) or Factor Xa (e.g., apixaban). It is not clear whether there are any efficacy differences between these two substances because there have never been any head-to-head studies carried out. We have carried out a study comparing two new orally active anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa<sup>\u00ae</sup>) and apixaban (Eliquis<sup>\u00ae</sup>) that were each given to two groups of 200 patients respectively, who had undergone elective hip or knee arthroplasty (100 each). Each patient was assessed for pre- and post-operative hemoglobin concentrations, post-operative blood loss, the number of transfused erythrocyte concentrates, the duration of wound secretion, clinical thromboembolic complications (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarct), as well as gastrointestinal, intracranial or wound-related bleeding complications. Dabigatran etexilate treatment led to a significant increase in the duration of wound secretion in both arthroplasty groups when compared to apixaban: wound secretion lasted 1.2 days longer on average in the dabigatran etexilate group than in the apixaban group (4.1 \u00b1 2.1 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 1.8 days). There were no significant differences observed between the two anticoagulant groups when comparing pre- and post-operative Hb values, post-operative blood loss and the other clinical parameters.

Previous studies have shown that mice lacking the dopamine D3 receptor (D3RKO) exhibit hypoalgesia, indicating a role of the D3 receptor in modulation of nociception. Given that there are sex differences in pain perception, there may be differences in responses to nociceptive stimuli between male and female D3RKO mice. In the current study, we examined the role of the D3 receptor in modulating nociception in male and female D3RKO mice. Acute thermal pain was modeled by hot-plate test. This test was performed at different temperatures including 52\u00b0C, 55\u00b0C, and 58\u00b0C. The von Frey hair test was applied to evaluate mechanical pain. And persistent pain produced by peripheral tissue injury and inflammation was modeled by formalin test. In the hot-plate test, compared with wild-type (WT) mice, D3RKO mice generally exhibited longer latencies at each of the three temperatures. Specially, male D3RKO mice showed hypoalgesia compared with male WT mice when the temperature was 55\u00b0C, while for the female mice, there was a statistical difference between genotypes when the test condition was 52\u00b0C. In the von Frey hair test, both male and female D3RKO mice exhibited hypoalgesia. In the formalin test, the male D3RKO mice displayed a similar nociceptive behavior as their sex-matched WT littermates, whereas significantly depressed late-phase formalin-induced nociceptive behaviors were observed in the female mutants. These findings indicated that the D3 receptor affects nociceptive behaviors in a sex-specific manner and that its absence induces more analgesic behavior in the female knockout mice. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Moreover, by using selective antagonists, the role of 5-HT1B/1D serotonergic receptors was investigated in the antinociception induced by these antimigraine drugs. The formalin test was used to assess the nociceptive activity. Overt pain-like behavior (flinching, 1h) and evoked nociception (long-lasting secondary mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, 6 days) were determined in the same rat. Ipsilateral, but not contralateral, pre-treatment (in \u03bcg/paw) with sumatriptan (10-300), methysergide (1-30) or dihydroergotamine (1-30) significantly prevented flinching behavior (at 1h) as well as secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia (at day 6) induced by formalin. Interestingly, the antinociceptive (flinching), antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of sumatriptan were completely prevented by peripheral pre-treatment with selective antagonists at the 5-HT1B (SB 224289; 100) or 5-HT1D (BRL 15572; 100) receptors. In contrast, the acute antinociceptive effects of methysergide and dihydroergotamine were partially prevented by SB 224289 and BRL 15572. The antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of both drugs were completely prevented by BRL 15572 and partially prevented by SB 224289. Given alone, SB 224289 or BRL 15572 did not modify per se the long-lasting secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia. The above findings suggest that: (i) the antimigraine drugs sumatriptan, methysergide and dihydroergotamine reduce the acute and chronic nociception induced by formalin; and (ii) this antinociceptive effect results from activation of peripheral 5-HT1B/1D serotonergic receptors.",

In this study, we examined the effect of systemic morphine on Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) evoked in the formalin test, a widely used model of persistent pain. Awake rats received a subcutaneous 150 microliters injection of 5% formalin into the plantar aspect of the right hindpaw. The pattern of nuclear FLI was consistent with the known nociceptive primary afferent input from the hindpaw. Dense labeling was recorded in the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I and IIo) and in the neck of the dorsal horn (laminae V and VI), areas that contain large populations of nociceptive neurons. Sparse labeling was noted in lamina IIi and in the nucleus proprius (laminae III and IV), generally considered to be nonnociceptive areas of the cord. Fos immunoreactivity was also evoked in the ventromedial gray, including laminae VII, VIII, and X. There was no labeling in lamina IX of the ventral horn. Since FLI was time dependent and distributed over several spinal segments, we focused our analysis where maximal staining was found (L3-L5) and at the earliest time point of the peak Fos immunoreactivity (2 hr). Twenty minutes prior to the formalin injection, the rats received morphine (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline vehicle. Two hours later, the rats were killed, their spinal cords removed, and 50 microns transverse sections of the lumbar enlargement were immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against Fos. Prior treatment with morphine sulfate profoundly suppressed formalin-evoked FLI in a dose-dependent and naloxone-reversible manner. The dose-response relationship of morphine-induced suppression of FLI varied in different laminae. To quantify the effect of morphine on FLI, labeled neurons in sections taken from the L4/5 level of each rat were plotted with a camera lucida and counted. Staining in the neck of the dorsal horn (laminae V and VI) and in more ventral laminae VII, VIII, and X, was profoundly suppressed by doses of morphine which also suppress formalin-evoked behavior. Although the labeling was also significantly reduced in laminae I and II, at the highest doses of morphine there was substantial residual labeling in the superficial dorsal horn. These data indicate that analgesia from systemic opiates involves differential regulation of nociceptive processing in subpopulations of spinal nociceptive neurons.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9431444": "The formalin test for nociception, predominantly used with rodents, is characterized by continuous pain due to tissue injury induced by formalin. In addition to the pain generated by formalin itself, the classical formalin test for nociception comprises a number of additional strong stressful events such as restraint and injury caused by needle insertion. These events have hampered its use as a model of stress employing continuous pain as a stress stimulus. We describe here a new, simple method of a subcutaneous application of formalin in conscious rats without restraint and needle insertion. Formalin or physiological saline (controls) was injected subcutaneously through a chronically implanted catheter in the region of the lower leg. In most animals, the cardiovascular and behavioural responses to subcutaneously injected formalin were biphasic. The early phase was quantitatively characterized. Formalin (2.5%, 50 microL) induced a marked increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Maximal increases occurred during the first 3 min after formalin injection and were followed by a gradual decline of both cardiovascular parameters to levels higher than the preinjection baseline. Subcutaneous saline injection did not induce any changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The behavioural response to formalin featured intensive licking and biting of the injection site. The behavioural response to subcutaneous saline did not differ from the spontaneous behavioural activity recorded in noninjected rats. Subcutaneously injected formalin induced an immediate increase in plasma corticotrophin (ACTH), corticosterone, noradrenaline, and adrenaline levels, and all hormones remained increased during the whole observation period (60 min). Adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in plasma were slightly, but significantly, elevated during the initial 5 min after subcutaneous saline application but returned to basal values after 15 min. The magnitude of the hormonal responses characterizes the described formalin test as a moderate stress stimulus. The complex response pattern to formalin injected through the subcutaneous catheter is brought about exclusively by pain generated by formalin-induced tissue injury. The described technique of subcutaneous formalin injection represents a new tool to study mechanisms activating brain neuronal circuits that generate the cardiovascular, endocrine, and behavioural responses of the reaction to pain.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15172765": "The subcutaneous injection of formalin into the rat upper lip generates behavioral responses that last several minutes. The time course of the response is similar to what is observed following formalin injection into the paw, i.e. biphasic, with an early and short-lasting first phase followed, after a quiescent period by a second, prolonged (tonic) phase. The applied chemical stimulus (formalin) can be qualified as noxious since it produces tissue injury, activates Adelta and C nociceptors as well as trigeminal and spinal nociceptive neurons and is felt as painful in man. In addition, increasing the concentration of formalin causes a parallel aggravation of histological signs of tissue inflammation and injury. The measured behavioral response (face rubbing) is a relevant end-point: prolonged face rubbing is evoked by formalin but not saline injection and a positive relationship between the amplitude of the response and the formalin concentration is observed, at least up to 2.5%. At higher formalin concentrations, the use of other or additional end-points should be considered. Finally, the behavioral response in the orofacial formalin test is sensitive to various opioid and non-opioid analgesics. The orofacial formalin test can then be considered as a reliable way of producing and quantifying nociception in the trigeminal region of the rat.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168051": "The formalin test is used as a primary behavioural screen for assaying the antinociceptive activity of compounds in laboratory rodents. After hindpaw formalin injection, nociceptive behaviours are expressed in a biphasic pattern and correlate closely with the concentration of formalin injected. Here, the antinociceptive efficacy of six compounds used in the clinical treatment of chronic pain was compared in rats injected with either 1% or 5% formalin. Predictably, the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (30-300 mg/kg) attenuated second phase (16-40 min) nociceptive behaviours in 5% formalin-injected rats; 1% formalin-injected rats were unaffected. The anti-epileptic drugs gabapentin (50-200 mg/kg) and lamotrigine (10-60 mg/kg) were antinociceptive only during second phase in both 1% and 5% tests. Notably, they were 2-4 times more potent in 1% vs 5% formalin-injected rats. The dual monoamine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine (3-60 mg/kg) consistently attenuated nociceptive behaviours during first phase and interphase in both tests. However second phase nociception was only attenuated in 5% formalin-injected rats giving rise to a 6 fold increase in potency compared with 1% formalin-injected rats. The micro-opioid receptor agonist morphine (1-6 mg/kg) and the combined micro-opioid receptor agonist/monoamine reuptake inhibitor tramadol (5-50 mg/kg) both attenuated nociceptive behaviours throughout the duration of both the 1% and 5% tests; no difference in antinociceptive potency occurred for either compound during second phase. Thus, for mechanistically-distinct compounds the predictive antinociceptive capacity of the formalin test can vary with the concentration of formalin injected, likely as a result of peripheral and central nociceptive signalling mechanisms being differentially engaged.",

These phases are separated with a quiet phase named interphase, in which the nociceptive responses are decreased or completely disappeared. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effects of swim stress at different heights of water on different phases of the formalin test in male rats. Swim stress decreased nociceptive behaviors in first phase and prolonged interphase or delayed the start of second phase in a water height dependent manner. Swim stress in 25 and 50cm completely abolished the nociceptive behaviors in phase 1. The present results showed different pain modulation during different phases of the formalin test and elucidated the impact of swim stress on duration of interphase. Interphase considered as an inactive period, but a recent research has shown that active inhibitory mechanisms are involved in the modulation of pain during this period. Therefore, swim stress may be considered as a useful tool for study of the basic inhibitory mechanisms underlying attenuation of nociceptive behaviors between phase 1 and 2 of the formalin test.",

In the previous study we demonstrated that temporal inactivation of RVM by lidocaine potentiated stress-induced analgesia. In this study, we investigated the effect of permanent lesion of the RVM on SIA by using formalin test as a model of acute inflammatory pain. Three sets of experiments were conducted: (1) Application of stress protocol (2) Formalin injection after exposing the animals to the swim stress (3) Either the relevant vehicle or dopamine receptor 1 (D1) agonist R-SKF38393 was injected into the RVM to cause a lesion. For permanent lesion of RVM, R-SKF38393 was injected into the RVM. Forced swim stress in water was employed in adult male rats. Nociceptive responses were measured by formalin test (50\u00b5l injection of formalin 2% subcutaneously into hind paw) and pain related behaviors were monitored for 90 min. In the unstressed rats, permanent lesion of the RVM by R-SKF38393 decreased formalin-induced nociceptive behaviors in phase 1, while in stressed rats, injection of R-SKF38393 into the RVM potentiated swim stress-induced antinociception in phase 1 and interphase, phase 2A of formalin test. Furthermore, R-SKF38393 had pronociceptive effects in phase2B whereas injections of R-SKF38393 resulted in significant difference in nociceptive bahaviours in all phases of formalin test (P&lt;0.05). The result of the present study demonstrated that permanent inactivation of RVM can potentiate stress-induced analgesia in formalin test.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436084": " Formalin injection induces nociceptive bahaviour in phase I and II, with a quiescent phase between them. While active inhibitory mechanisms are proposed to be responsible for initiation of interphase, the exact mechanisms which lead to termination of nociceptive response in phase II are not clear yet. Phase II is a consequence of peripheral and central sensitization processes, which can lead to termination of the noxious stimuli responses; 45-60 minutes after formalin injection via possible recruitment of active inhibitory mechanisms which we have investigated in this study. To test our hypothesis, in the first set of experiments, we evaluated nociceptive response after two consecutive injection of formalin (50\u00b5L, 2%), with intervals of 5 or 60 minutes. In the next set, formalin tests were carried out in companion with injection of Naloxone Hydrochloride, a non-selective antagonist of opioid receptors, pre-formalin injection and 30 and 45 minutes post formalin injection. While normal nociceptive behaviour was observed in the group receiving one injection of formalin, a diminished response was observed in phases I and II of those receiving consequent injection of formalin, 60 minute after first injection. While second injection of formalin, 5 minute after first injection, had no effect. Administration of naloxone (1mg/kg) decreased nociception in phase 2A; but had no effect on delayed termination of formalin test. The results of this study suggest the existence of an active inhibitory mechanism, other than the endogenous opioids, that is responsible for termination of nociceptive behaviour at the end of formalin test.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8628579": "The rat paw formalin test is a model of prolonged pain due to mild tissue injury. There is some evidence suggesting that morphine does not produce antinociception in the formalin test via the brain-stem and spinal cord circuitry normally associated with antinociception. Furthermore, morphine appears to require an intact forebrain in order to function as an analgesic for formalin pain. In the 2 experiments reported here, we investigated the possibility that the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) contributes to the production of morphine antinociception (MA) in the formalin test. Nociception in this test occurs in 2 phases, with the 1st phase occurring 0-5 min after formalin injection and the 2nd phase beginning 10-15 min after injection and continuing for approximately 1 h. In Exp. 1, bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the Ce, but not lesions of the adjacent basolateral nucleus (BL), reliably attenuated MA (7 mg/kg morphine sulfate) during the 2nd phase of the formalin test without affecting baseline nociception. These results were obtained regardless of whether the rating scale method or flinch-frequency method of nociceptive scoring was used. During the 1st phase, Ce lesions reliably attenuated MA as measured by the flinch-frequency method, but not as measured by the rating scale method. In Exp. 2, Ce lesions also reliably attenuated the antinociception produced by 12 mg/kg morphine sulfate during the 2nd phase of the formalin test. Antinociception appeared to be almost completely re-instated, however, if the dose of morphine was raised to 20 mg/kg. The results indicate that neurons originating from the Ce contribute to the production of MA during the 2nd phase, and possibly the 1st phase, of the formalin test, especially at relatively lower doses of morphine. This suggests that in addition to coordinating conditioned antinociceptive responses, the amygdala may be a component of endogenous antinociceptive circuitry. These and other issues are discussed with reference to the spino-ponto-amygdaloid nociceptive pathway, and the proposed role of the amygdala in the mediation of defense reactions.",

However, little is known about the effects of low formalin concentrations on related behavioural responses. To examine this, rat pups were subjected to various concentrations of formalin at four developmental stages: 7, 13, 22, and 82 days of age. At postnatal day (PND) 7, sex differences in flinching but not licking responses were observed with 0.5% formalin evoking higher flinching in males than in females. A dose response was evident in that 0.5% formalin also produced higher licking responses compared to 0.3% or 0.4% formalin. At PND 13, a concentration of 0.8% formalin evoked a biphasic response. At PND 22, a concentration of 1.1% evoked higher flinching and licking responses during the late phase (10-30 min) in both males and females. During the early phase (0-5 min), 1.1% evoked higher licking responses compared to 0.9% or 1% formalin. 1.1% formalin produced a biphasic response that was not evident with 0.9 or 1%. At PND 82, rats displayed a biphasic pattern in response to three formalin concentrations (1.25%, 1.75% and 2.25%) with the presence of an interphase for both 1.75% and 2.25% but not for 1.25%. These data suggest that low formalin concentrations induce fine-tuned responses that are not apparent with the high formalin concentration commonly used in the formalin test. These data also show that the developing nociceptive system is very sensitive to subtle changes in formalin concentrations.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20832171": "Although the formalin test is a widely used model of persistent pain, the primary afferent fiber types that underlie the cellular and behavioral responses to formalin injection are largely unknown. Here we used a combined genetic and pharmacological approach to investigate the effect of ablating subsets of primary afferent nociceptors on formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors and spinal cord Fos protein expression. Intrathecal capsaicin-induced ablation of the central terminals of TRPV1+neurons greatly reduced the behavioral responses and Fos elicited by low-dose (0.5%) formalin. In contrast, genetic ablation of the MrgprD-expressing subset of non-peptidergic unmyelinated afferents, which constitute a largely non-overlapping population, altered neither the behavior nor the Fos induced by low-dose formalin. Remarkably, nocifensive behavior following high-dose (2%) formalin was unchanged in mice lacking either afferent population, or even in mice lacking both populations, which together make up the great majority of C-fiber nociceptors. Thus, at high doses, which are routinely used in the formalin test, formalin-induced \"pain\" behavior persists in the absence of the vast majority of C-fiber nociceptors, which points to a contribution of a large spectrum of afferents secondary to non-specific formalin-induced tissue and nerve damage.",

The study aims to evaluate the effect of clove oil on experimental models of pain and cognition in mice. To observe the acute effects of clove oil at different doses, the elevated plus maze was used for the assessment of cognition, and the tail flick and formalin tests were used for the study of pain. The formalin test showed that clove oil (0.1 ml/kg, i.p.) demonstrated significantly reduced pain response in both the phases. The lower doses (0.025 and 0.05 ml/kg, i.p.) reduced the formalin-induced pain response significantly in the second phase only. The tail-flick test showed variable response. The dose 0.1 ml/kg, clove oil, significantly decreased the tail-flick latency at 30 min and this effect was reversed by naloxone (1 mg/kg). On the contrary, the dose 0.025 ml/kg of clove oil, at 30 and 60 min increased the mean tail-flick latency compared to control group, but this effect was not statistically significant. Yet naloxone significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reversed the effect of clove oil 0.025 ml/kg at 30 min. Clove oil (0.025 and 0.05 ml/kg, i.p.) significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced retention memory deficit induced by scopolamine, but clove oil (0.1 ml/kg, i.p.) significantly reversed both acquisition as well as retention deficits in elevated plus maze induced by the scopolamine. Clove oil exhibits reduced pain response by a predominantly peripheral action as evidenced by formalin test and the tail flick test showed the involvement of opioid receptors.

Formalin (2.5%, 50 microliters) was injected either directly in or adjacent to the mechanical receptive fields of single C-fibers isolated from the saphenous nerve of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The average formalin-evoked response in C-fibers (n = 29) over time was biphasic. This biphasic time course of the C-fiber response to formalin is similar to that of the behavioral response in the awake animal and is compatible with the hypothesis that increased C-fiber activity contributes to the behavioral response in phase 2, as well as in phase 1 of the formalin test.",

Rats with transections of the brain rostral or caudal to the pons show behavioral reactions to formalin similar to those of normal rats, although the temporary abatement of pain 10-15 min after formalin is absent in transected animals. Doses of morphine that suppress the behavioral response to formalin in normal rats are not antinociceptive in the formalin test in decerebrate rats although sedation, catalepsy and inhibition of the tail-flick reflex still occur. These results suggest that the response to formalin is organized in the brain stem but the antinociceptive effect of morphine in this test is mediated by the diencephalon or forebrain.",

Most of them are spontaneous due to anticoagulant therapy and called spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas (SSEHs). Laminectomy or hemilaminectomy for affected levels is still the first choice in the operative treatment of an SSEH. We describe a new less invasive surgical technique, performing single-level laminectomy and washing with 0.9% sodium chloride through a thin soft catheter for a 12-level thoracic-cervical SSEH in a patient under anticoagulant therapy. <b>Patient and Operative Technique</b> A 55-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with a rapid onset of pain in her upper back and both legs with weakness of her lower extremities. An urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine showed a SEH. During the operation, after T2 laminectomy, a thin soft catheter was epidurally placed under the T1 lamina and gently pushed forward rostrally. Then continuous saline irrigation was utilized and aspiration made via the catheter to wash out the hematoma. Drainage of blood was observed. The procedure was performed for 15 minutes. Then the catheter was epidurally placed under the T3 lamina, and the procedure for the hematoma in the lower segment was repeated. Decompression of spinal cord and nerve roots was observed. <b>Result</b> Postoperative early MRI of the thoracic-cervical spine showed gross total evacuation of the SEH. Accordingly, the patient's muscle strength improved. <b>Conclusion</b> Although multiple laminectomy or hemilaminectomy for affected levels to evacuate the hematoma and decompress the spinal cord is the main choice of surgical treatment, single-level laminectomy and irrigation plus aspiration via a thin soft catheter can be performed successfully with good results in SSEH.",

A variant named atypical DISH-like with SEH is reported. To describe the management, diagnosis, and treatment of an unusual SEH case in a patient causing delayed neurologic deficit with rigid atypical DISH-like spine.

Using a midline posterior approach, an urgent intervention and a left multiple partial unilateral decompressive laminectomy at T4-T7 and a long instrumented fusion at T3-T9 were performed for achieving spinal stability and neurological improvement, both of which were observed. Patients with rigid spine who sustain low-energy injuries may be prone to have a fracture and epidural hematoma, especially if they take anticoagulant medications.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed characteristic findings at the thoracolumbar spine, and surgical evacuation successfully treated this condition. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient gradually recovered from paraparesis and was discharged 4 weeks after operation. We report an extremely rare case of chronic spinal subdural hematoma associated with antiplatelet therapy.

A 76-year-old man with a history of cerebral infarction had been taking antiplatelet agents for one year. He suddenly developed severe back pain which woke him from sleep, and numbness of his lower extremities was then noted. He was hospitalized 15 hours later. Neurological examination revealed flaccid paralysis of both lower extremities with negative Babinski's reflex, and sensory disturbance below the level of L1. The bleeding time and prothrombin time were prolonged. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a biconvex, relatively hyperdense mass in the posterior spinal canal at the level of T12. Metrizamide myelography disclosed an incomplete blockage caused by an epidural mass at the level of T11. Post-myelographic CT scan demonstrated a sharply demarcated extradural filling defect at the level of T11. Seventeen hours after the onset of symptoms, an emergency laminectomy was performed extending from T12 to L3, and the epidural clot was totally evacuated. Histological examination of the capsule of the hematoma revealed no vascular anomalies. The patient made a good postoperative recovery. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous intraspinal hemorrhage in a patient taking antiplatelet drugs. Acute onset of persistent pain anywhere along the spinal axis and the development of spinal neurological deficits in a patient on antiplatelet therapy should raise the suspicion of a spinal epidural hematoma. It should be stressed that prompt neuroradiological diagnosis and rapid surgical decompression are essential to allow good recovery.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12520314": "Spinal hematoma has been described in autopsies since 1682 and as a clinical diagnosis since 1867. It is a rare and usually severe neurological disorder that, without adequate treatment, often leads to death or permanent neurological deficit. Epidural as well as subdural and subarachnoid hematomas have been investigated. Some cases of subarachnoid spinal hematoma may present with symptoms similar to those of cerebral hemorrhage. The literature offers no reliable estimates of the incidence of spinal hematoma, perhaps due to the rarity of this disorder. In the present work, 613 case studies published between 1826 and 1996 have been evaluated, which represents the largest review on this topic to date. Most cases of spinal hematoma have a multifactorial etiology whose individual components are not all understood in detail. In up to a third of cases (29.7%) of spinal hematoma, no etiological factor can be identified as the cause of the bleeding. Following idiopathic spinal hematoma, cases related to anticoagulant therapy and vascular malformations represent the second and third most common categories. Spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures in combination with anticoagulant therapy represent the fifth most common etiological group and spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures alone represent the tenth most common cause of spinal hematoma. Anticoagulant therapy alone probably does not trigger spinal hemorrhage. It is likely that there must additionally be a \"locus minoris resistentiae\" together with increased pressure in the interior vertebral venous plexus in order to cause spinal hemorrhage. The latter two factors are thought to be sufficient to cause spontaneous spinal hematoma. Physicians should require strict indications for the use of spinal anesthetic procedures in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy, even if the incidence of spinal hematoma following this combination is low. If spinal anesthetic procedures are performed before, during, or after anticoagulant treatment, close monitoring of the neurological status of the patient is warranted. Time limits regarding the use of anticoagulant therapy before or after spinal anesthetic procedures have been proposed and are thought to be safe for patients. Investigation of the coagulation status alone does not necessarily provide an accurate estimate of the risk of hemorrhage. The most important measure for recognizing patients at high risk is a thorough clinical history. Most spinal hematomas are localized dorsally to the spinal cord at the level of the cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar regions. Subarachnoid hematomas can extend along the entire length of the subarachnoid space. Epidural and subdural spinal hematoma present with intense, knife-like pain at the location of the hemorrhage (\"coup de poignard\") that may be followed in some cases by a pain-free interval of minutes to days, after which there is progressive paralysis below the affected spinal level. Subarachnoid hematoma can be associated with meningitis symptoms, disturbances of consciousness, and epileptic seizures and is often misdiagnosed as cerebral hemorrhage based on these symptoms. Most patients are between 55 and 70 years old. Of all patients with spinal hemorrhage, 63.9% are men. The examination of first choice is magnetic resonance imaging. The treatment of choice is surgical decompression. Of the patients investigated in the present work, 39.6% experienced complete recovery. The less severe the preoperative symptoms are and the more quickly surgical decompression can be performed, the better are the chances for complete recovery. It is therefore essential to recognize the relatively typical clinical presentation of spinal hematoma in a timely manner to allow correct diagnostic and therapeutic measures to be taken to maximize the patient's chance of complete recovery.",

The result is a progressively worsening triad of cognitive, emotional, and motor alterations that typically begin in adulthood and end in death 10-20 years later. Autopsy of HD patients indicates massive cell loss in the striatum and its main source of input, the cerebral cortex. Further studies of HD patients and transgenic animal models of HD indicate that corticostriatal neuronal processing is altered long before neuronal death takes place. In fact, altered neuronal function appears to be the primary driver of the HD behavioral phenotype, and dysregulation of glutamate, the excitatory amino acid released by corticostriatal afferents, is believed to play a critical role. Although mutant HTT interferes with the operation of multiple proteins related to glutamate transmission, consistent evidence links the expression of mutant HTT with reduced activity of glutamate transporter 1 (rodent GLT1 or human EAAT2), the astrocytic protein responsible for the bulk of glutamate uptake. Here, we review corticostriatal dysfunction in HD and focus on GLT1 and its expression in astrocytes as a possible therapeutic target.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common of these disorders and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is very similar to HD, but is caused by mutation in a different gene, making them good models to study. In this review, we will concentrate on the roles of protein aggregation, nuclear localization and proteolytic processing in disease pathogenesis. In cell model studies of HD, we have found that truncated N-terminal portions of huntingtin (the HD gene product) with expanded repeats form more aggregates than longer or full length huntingtin polypeptides. These shorter fragments are also more prone to aggregate in the nucleus and cause more cell toxicity. Further experiments with huntingtin constructs harbouring exogenous nuclear import and nuclear export signals have implicated the nucleus in direct cell toxicity. We have made mouse models of HD and DRPLA using an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin (N171) and full-length atrophin-1 (the DRPLA gene product), respectively. In both models, diffuse neuronal nuclear staining and nuclear inclusion bodies are observed in animals expressing the expanded glutamine repeat protein, further implicating the nucleus as a primary site of neuronal dysfunction. Neuritic pathology is also observed in the HD mice. In the DRPLA mouse model, we have found that truncated fragments of atrophin-1 containing the glutamine repeat accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that proteolysis may be critical for disease progression. Taken together, these data lead towards a model whereby proteolytic processing, nuclear localization and protein aggregation all contribute to pathogenesis.",

Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. By comparison of mouse and human lamina interaction maps, we find that the sizes and genomic positions of cLADs are strongly conserved. Moreover, cLADs are depleted of synteny breakpoints, pointing to evolutionary selective pressure to keep cLADs intact. Paradoxically, the overall sequence conservation is low for cLADs. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this \"A/T rule\" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level. Taken together, these results reveal that the spatial organization of mammalian genomes is highly conserved and tightly linked to local nucleotide composition.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22704991": " Signaling by transmembrane receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) occurs at the cell surface and throughout the endocytic pathway, and signaling from the cell surface may differ in magnitude and downstream output from intracellular signaling. As a result, the rate at which signaling molecules traverse the endocytic pathway makes a significant contribution to downstream output. Modulation of the core endocytic machinery facilitates differential uptake of individual cargoes. Clathrin-coated pits are a major entry portal where assembled clathrin forms a lattice around invaginating buds that have captured endocytic cargo. Clathrin assembles into triskelia composed of three clathrin heavy chains and associated clathrin light chains (CLCs). Despite the identification of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface over 30 years ago, the functions of CLCs in endocytosis have been elusive. In this work, we identify a novel role for CLCs in the regulated endocytosis of specific cargoes. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either CLCa or CLCb inhibits the uptake of GPCRs. Moreover, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser204 in CLCb is required for efficient endocytosis of a subset of GPCRs and identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a kinase that can phosphorylate CLCb on Ser204. Overexpression of CLCb(S204A) specifically inhibits the endocytosis of those GPCRs whose endocytosis is GRK2-dependent. Together, these results indicate that CLCb phosphorylation acts as a discriminator for the endocytosis of specific GPCRs.",

We have developed procedures, on the basis of static and dynamic light scattering, to determine the radius of gyration, R(g), and hydrodynamic radius, R(H), of isolated triskelia, under conditions where cage assembly occurs. Calculations based on rigid molecular bead models of a triskelion show that the measured values can be accounted for by bending the legs and a puckering at the vertex.

We extend the earlier solution studies by performing small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on isolated triskelia, allowing us to examine a higher q range than that probed by static light scattering. Results of the SANS measurements are consistent with the light scattering measurements, but show a shoulder in the scattering function at intermediate q values (0.016 A(-1)), just beyond the Guinier regime. This feature can be accounted for by Brownian dynamics simulations based on flexible bead-spring models of a triskelion, which generate time-averaged scattering functions. Calculated scattering profiles are in good agreement with the experimental SANS profiles when the persistence length of the assumed semiflexible triskelion is close to that previously estimated from the analysis of electron micrographs.",

Even slight defects in myelin integrity impair performance and enhance the risk of neurological disorders. Indeed, myelin degeneration is an early and well-recognized neuropathology that is age associated, but appears before cognitive decline. Myelin is only formed by fully differentiated oligodendrocytes, but the entire oligodendrocyte lineage are clear targets of the altered chemistry of the aging brain. As in neurons, unrepaired DNA damage accumulates in the postmitotic oligodendrocyte genome during normal aging, and indeed may be one of the upstream causes of cellular aging - a fact well illustrated by myelin co-morbidity in premature aging syndromes arising from deficits in DNA repair enzymes. The clinical and experimental evidence from Alzheimer's disease, progeroid syndromes, ataxia-telangiectasia and other conditions strongly suggest that oligodendrocytes may in fact be uniquely vulnerable to oxidative DNA damage. If this damage remains unrepaired, as is increasingly true in the aging brain, myelin gene transcription and oligodendrocyte differentiation is impaired. Delineating the relationships between early myelin loss and DNA damage in brain aging will offer an additional dimension outside the neurocentric view of neurodegenerative disease.",

Given that construction of SC myelin requires high levels of lipid and protein synthesis, mitochondria, which are pivotal in cellular metabolism, may be potential regulators of the formation and maintenance of SC myelin. Supporting this notion, abnormal mitochondria are found in SCs of neuropathic peripheral nerves in both human patients and the relevant animal models. However, evidence for the importance of SC mitochondria in myelination has been limited, until recently. Several studies have recently used genetic approaches that allow SC-specific ablation of mitochondrial metabolic activity in living animals to show the critical roles of SC mitochondria in the development and maintenance of peripheral nerve axons. Here, we review current knowledge about the involvement of SC mitochondria in the formation and dysfunction of myelinated axons in the peripheral nervous system.",

In the central nervous system, polarized oligodendrocytes form myelin by wrapping processes in a spiral pattern around neuronal axons through myelin-related gene regulation. Since these events occur at a distance from the cell body, post-transcriptional control of gene expression has strategic advantage to fine-tune the overall regulation of protein contents in situ. Therefore, many research interests have been focused to identify RNA binding proteins and their regulatory mechanism in myelinating compartments. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is one such RNA binding protein, regulating its target expression by translational control. Although the majority of works on FMRP have been performed in neurons, it is also found in the developing or mature glial cells including oligodendrocytes, where its function is not well understood. Here, we will review evidences suggesting abnormal translational regulation of myelin proteins with accompanying white matter problem and neurological deficits in fragile X syndrome, which can have wider mechanistic and pathological implication in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders.",

Oligodendrocytes form CNS myelin; the prevailing hypothesis being that they do it by extending a process that circumnavigates the axon. It is pertinent to ask how myelin is built because oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and myelin are compositionally different. To this end, we examined oligodendrocyte cultures and embryonic avian optic nerves by electron microscopy, immuno-electron microscopy and three-dimensional electron tomography. The results support three novel concepts. Myelin membranes are synthesized as tubules and packaged into \"myelinophore organelles\" in the oligodendrocyte perikaryon. Myelin membranes are matured in and transported by myelinophore organelles within an oligodendrocyte process. The myelin sheath is generated by myelin membrane fusion inside an oligodendrocyte process. These findings abrogate the dogma of myelin resulting from a wrapping motion of an oligodendrocyte process and open up new avenues in the quest for understanding myelination in health and disease.",

Then, we explored the effects of different myelin concentrations on the NSCs proliferation by MTT assays. Our results showed that 2 \u03bcg/ml myelin can promote the proliferation of NSCs, while NgR antibody can antagonize the effect. In addition, myelin can inhibit the differentiation of NSCs into O4(+) oligodendrocytes impeding them maturation.

In particular, osteoarticular complications are the most common focal manifestation of brucellosis and occur in 40-80% of patients. In immunocompetent mice, Brucella replication is generally restricted to the spleen, liver, and to a lesser extent, LNs, thereby limiting their use for study of focal inflammation often found in brucellosis. Here, we report that nasal, oral, or peritoneal infection of IFN-\u03b3(-/-) mice with WT Brucella melitensis or Brucella abortus results in joint and periarticular tissue inflammation. Histological analysis of the affected joints revealed inflammatory infiltrates and debris within the joint space colocalizing with Brucella antigen. Osteoarthritis, necrosis, periarticular soft tissue inflammation, and substantial brucellae burdens were observed. Oral rifampicin was effective in clearing infection and halting further progression of focal inflammation from infected IFN-\u03b3(-/-) mice, although some symptoms and swelling remained.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that liposomal form of a recombinant ribosomal L7/L12 protein, a B-T cell antigen of B. abortus, activates strong immune response in the host. In contrast, free antigen generates moderate immune response in the immunised animals. The liposomisation of rL7/L12 protein causes tremendous increase in cell-mediated immune response in terms of delayed type hypersensitivity, T-cell proliferation and up-regulation in type I cytokine expression, etc. Moreover, the liposome encapsulated antigen elicited stronger humoral immune response as compared to standard vaccine (S-19) or IFA-L7/L12 combination in the immunised animals. The effectiveness of liposome-based vaccine was also substantiated by better systemic clearance of bacterial load after challenging the animals with B. abortus 544 pathogen.

TLR9 is required for the initial host control of B. abortus, but this TLR was dispensable after 6 wk of infection.

Using the genomic survey sequence (GSS) approach, we identified the gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter of B. abortus strain S2308. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by this gene exhibited 69 and 67% identity with the sequences of the ABC transporters encoded by the exsA genes of Rhizobium meliloti and Mesorhizobium loti, respectively.

Hemagglutination inhibition experiments suggested that the 14-kDa protein has affinity towards mannose. Disruption of the gene encoding the 14-kDa protein in virulent B. abortus strain 2308 induced a rough-like phenotype with an altered smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immunoblot profile and a significant reduction in the bacterium's ability to replicate in mouse spleens.

In contrast to the case for the smooth virulent strain 2308, in the rough attenuated strain RB51 disruption of the 14-kDa protein's gene had no effect on the mouse clearance pattern. These findings indicate that the 14-kDa protein of B. abortus possesses lectin-like properties and is essential for the virulence of the species, probably because of its direct or indirect role in the synthesis of smooth LPS.",

We show that the power to reject ancient admixture increases as the ratio, at the time of putative admixture, of the population size of Homo sapiens over that of Neanderthal decreases. We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size.",

In the present study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity among a worldwide collection of contemporary human populations with respect to the genetic constitution of these two archaic hominins and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee). We partitioned SNPs into subsets, including those that are derived in both archaic lineages, those that are ancestral in both archaic lineages and those that are only derived in one archaic lineage. By doing this, we have conducted separate examinations of subsets of mutations with higher probabilities of divergent phylogenetic origins. While previous investigations have excluded SNPs from common ancestors in principal component analyses, we included common ancestral SNPs in our analyses to visualize the relative placement of the Neanderthal and Denisova among human populations. To assess the genetic similarities among the various hominin lineages, we performed genetic structure analyses to provide a comparison of genetic patterns found within contemporary human genomes that may have archaic or common ancestral roots. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe. Our results suggest that Neanderthal genetic associations with contemporary non-Sub-Saharan African populations, as well as the genetic affinities observed between Denisovans and Melanesians most likely result from the retention of ancient mutations in these populations.",

Here, we present evidence of Neanderthal introgression within the chromosome 3p21.31 region, occurring with a high frequency in East Asians (ranging from 49.4% to 66.5%) and at a low frequency in Europeans. We also detected a signal of strong positive selection in this region only in East Asians. Our data indicate that likely candidate targets of selection include rs12488302-T and its associated alleles--among which four are nonsynonymous, including rs35455589-G in HYAL2, a gene related to the cellular response to ultraviolet-B irradiation. Furthermore, suggestive evidence supports latitude-dependent selection, implicating a role of ultraviolet-B. Interestingly, the distribution of rs35455589-G suggests that this allele was lost during the exodus of ancestors of modern Eurasians from Africa and reintroduced to Eurasians from Neanderthals.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26392408": "In this study, we present an analysis of Neanderthal introgression at the dipeptidase 1 gene, DPEP1. A Neanderthal origin for the putative introgressive haplotypes was demonstrated using an established three-step approach. This introgression was under positive natural selection, reached a frequency of &gt;50%, and introduced a homocysteine level- and pigmentation-associated allele (rs460879-T) into East Asians. However, the same allele was also found in non-East Asians, but not from Neanderthal introgression. It is likely that rs460879-T was lost in East Asians and was reintroduced subsequently through Neanderthal introgression. Our findings suggest that Neanderthal introgression could reintroduce an important previously existing allele into populations where the allele had been lost. This study sheds new light on understanding the contribution of Neanderthal introgression to the adaptation of non-Africans.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824859": "Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans. After hybridization, on average, selection appears to have removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. Quantifying the strength and causes of this selection against Neanderthal ancestry is key to understanding our relationship to Neanderthals and, more broadly, how populations remain distinct after secondary contact. Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral-and segregating at high frequency-in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. While individually of small effect, these alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on the early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038113": "Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.",

Examination of the significance of non-operative treatment of Dupuytren's disease with injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) METHODS: Observation of 120 patients treated with injectable collagenase. Documentation of the range of motion before the intervention, 12 months after the intervention, and documentation of any adverse events. All in all, 120 patients were treated (107 male, 13 female) (mean age 62 years, range 30-84 years). In 49% the little finger, in 44% the ring finger, in 4% the middle finger, and in 3% the index finger were treated. Full release was accomplished in 71%, partial release in 26%, and no change in 3% of the patients. The median contracture before the treatment was 37\u00b0 for the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint (range 25-100\u00b0) and 51\u00b0 for the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint (range 30-97\u00b0). After 12 months, the mean contracture for the MP joint was 9\u00b0 (range 0-25\u00b0) and 21\u00b0 (range 10-36\u00b0) or the PIP joint. Adverse events occurred in 96% of patients within 3 months after treatment. No tendon ruptures, anaphylactic reactions, nerve, or ligament injuries were observed.",

Several treatment options exist, but none are curative and recurrence is common. Bacterial collagenase has recently been proven beneficial for treating Dupuytren's disease, cleaving the collagen fibers at different sites, with weakening and eventually rupture of the fibrous cords after manipulation. An independent prospective follow-up study was organized on 87 patients, treated with one or more collagenase injections. Inclusion criteria were a contracture of at least 20\u00b0 at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) or the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. The most diseased joint was taken into consideration for follow-up evaluation. The resulting extension deficit was measured at 1 month, 1 year and 2 years and was graded as \"clinical success\", \"clinical improvement\" or \"clinical failure\". The mean contracture improved from 45\u00b0 (39\u00b0 for MCP and 54\u00b0 for PIP joints) before treatment to 5\u00b0 (2\u00b0 for MCP and 9\u00b0 for PIP joints) 4 weeks after treatment. No serious complications occurred. After 2 years, 68 joints were evaluated; 61.5% of the MCP joints and 34.5% of the PIP joints had a contracture of \u226420\u00b0. When compared with the 4-week evaluation, 28.2% of MCP joints and 62.1% of PIP joints had a recurrence (20\u00b0 or greater worsening) or had received additional treatment. Collagenase injection is a safe and effective treatment option for Dupuytren disease, but recurrence is common especially for the PIP joint.",

The contractures are painless but cause one or more fingers to curl into the palm, resulting in loss of function. Standard treatment within the NHS is surgery to remove (fasciectomy) or divide (fasciotomy) the contractures, and the treatment offered is frequently determined by surgeon preference. This study aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a large, multicentre randomised controlled trial to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of needle fasciotomy versus limited fasciectomy for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.

Recent studies have shown that molecules of extracellular matrix may coordinate morphogenesis, cell differentiation, and most importantly, fibrogenesis in tissue. Gelatinase A (MMP-2) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family of proteolytic enzymes that contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix by degrading its components. The aim of this study was to determine the level of MMP-2 activation in the palmar fascia of patients with Dupuytren's contracture with reference to the clinical stages of disease progression and recurrence of the contracture after surgery. The level of relative MMP-2 activation, expressed by the active to latent MMP-2 ratio, was investigated with use of zymography and computerized densitometry in 16 normal and 71 pathologic tissues characterizing different clinical stages of the disease progression. We found that the level of MMP-2 activation was significantly elevated in the palmar fascias with Dupuytren's contracture compared with normal tissues. We did not find statistically significant differences between groups with different stages of the disease progression. We also did not find a relation between a high level of MMP-2 activation and the recurrence in the area of surgically treated Dupuytren's contracture. The differences in MMP-2 activation between contractured and normal fascia suggest a participation of this enzyme in the promotion of Dupuytren's disease.

Current treatment for Dupuytren's contracture is mainly limited to surgery. In the Netherlands, little is known about the prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture. In this study we determined the prevalence of patients with a hospitalization for Dupuytren's contracture in the Netherlands and characterized their (re)hospitalizations. From the PHARMO database, which consists of multiple observational databases linked on a patient level, all patients hospitalized for Dupuytren's contracture between 2004 and 2007 were included in the source population (ICD-9-CM code 728.6). Numbers from this source population were used to provide estimates of hospitalizations for Dupuytren's contracture in the Netherlands. Patients with a medical history in the PHARMO database of at least 12 months before their hospitalization were included in the study cohort and followed until end of data collection, death, or end of study period, whichever occurred first. Type of admission, length of stay, recorded procedures, treating specialty, number of rehospitalizations for Dupuytren's contracture, and time to first rehospitalization were assessed. Of 3, 126 patients included in the source population, 3, 040 were included in the study population. The overall prevalence of patients with a hospitalization for Dupuytren's contracture was 0.04%, with the highest prevalence (0.25%) among 60-79 year old males. The majority (85%) of all hospitalizations were day-case admissions. Of the admitted inpatients (15%) the majority (81%) had one overnight stay in the hospital. The most common recorded procedure was fasciectomy (87%) and 78% of patients was treated by a plastic surgeon. During a median (IQR) follow-up of 2.9 (1.8-4.0) years, 523 patients were rehospitalized for Dupuytren's contracture. The median (IQR) time to first rehospitalization was 0.8 (0.4-1.9) years. This study is a first exploration of Dupuytren's contracture in the Netherlands based on hospitalizations, showing a prevalence of 0.25% among 60-79 year old males. Future studies should also address outpatient procedures to get a complete picture of the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. In addition, patients not yet treated should be included to be able to estimate the prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture.",

Results of these studies are consistent with a linear recessive allelic model with multiplicative penetrance in the inheritance of red hair. Four alleles, D84E, R151C, R160W, and D294H, are strongly associated with red hair and fair skin with multinomial regression analysis showing odds ratios of 63, 118, 50, and 94, respectively. An additional three low-penetrance alleles V60L, V92M, and R163Q have odds ratios 6, 5, and 2 relative to the wild-type allele. To address the cellular effects of MC1R variant alleles in signal transduction, we expressed these receptors in permanently transfected HEK293 cells. Measurement of receptor activity via induction of a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter gene found that the R151C and R160W receptors were active in the presence of NDP-MSH ligand, but at much reduced levels compared with that seen with the wild-type receptor. The ability to stimulate phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor was also apparent in all stimulated MC1R variant allele-expressing HEK293 cell extracts as assessed by immunoblotting. In contrast, human melanoma cell lines showed wide variation in the their ability to undergo cAMP-mediated CREB phosphorylation. Culture of human melanocytes of known MC1R genotype may provide the best experimental approach to examine the functional consequences for each MC1R variant allele. With this objective, we have established more than 300 melanocyte cell strains of defined MC1R genotype.",

Several MC1R variant alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin and increased skin cancer risk. We have performed a systematic functional analysis of nine common MC1R variants and correlated these results with the strength of the genetic association of each variant allele with pigmentation phenotypes. In vitro expression studies revealed that variant receptors with reduced cell surface expression, including V60L, D84E, R151C, I155T, R160W and R163Q, showed a corresponding impairment in cAMP coupling. The R142H and D294H variants demonstrated normal cell surface expression, but had reduced functional responses, indicating that altered G-protein coupling may be responsible for this loss of function. The V92M variant cAMP activation was equal to or higher than that for wild-type MC1R. In co-expression studies, the D84E, R151C, I155T and R160W variants showed a dominant negative effect on wild-type receptor cell surface expression, which was reflected in a decreased ability to elevate intracellular cAMP levels. The D294H variant also demonstrated a dominant negative effect on wild-type MC1R cAMP signalling, but had no effect on wild-type surface expression. Importantly, comparison of the in vitro receptor characteristics with skin and hair colour data of individuals both homozygous and heterozygous for MC1R variant alleles revealed parallels between variant MC1R cell surface expression, functional ability, dominant negative activity and their effects on human pigmentation. These findings show the first direct correlations between variant MC1R biochemical properties and pigmentation phenotype.",

Logistic regressions were performed to assess the influence of MC1R polymorphisms on severe photoaging with adjustment for possible confounders (demographic and phenotypic data and sun exposure intensity). Among the fifteen MC1R variants identified, the nine most common were V60L, V92M, R151C, R160W, R163Q, R142H, D294H, D84E, and I155T. One hundred and eighty-five individuals (35%) were WT homozygotes, 261 (49%) had one common variant, 78 (15%) had two common variants, and six (1%) had at least one rare variant. After adjustment for possible confounders, the presence of two common variants was already a risk factor for severe photoaging (AOR (95% confidence interval): 2.33 (1.17-4.63)). This risk reached 5.61 (1.43-21.96) when two major diminished-function variants were present. Surprisingly, the minor variant, V92M, was associated with increased risk of photoaging (2.57 (1.23-5.35)).

This atypical observation has been interpreted as the result of purifying selection due to functional constraint on MC1R in high UV-B radiation environments. By analyzing 3,142 human MC1R alleles from different regions of Spain in the context of additional haplotypic information from the 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project data, we show that purifying selection is also strong in southern Europe, but not so in northern Europe. Furthermore, we show that purifying and positive selection act simultaneously on MC1R. Thus, at least in Spain, regions at opposite ends of the incident UV-B radiation distribution show significantly different frequencies for the melanoma-risk allele V60L (a mutation also associated to red hair and fair skin and even blonde hair), with higher frequency of V60L at those regions of lower incident UV-B radiation. Besides, using the 1000G south European data, we show that the V60L haplogroup is also characterized by an extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) pattern indicative of positive selection. We, thus, provide evidence for an adaptive value of human skin depigmentation in Europe and illustrate how an adaptive process can simultaneously help to maintain a disease-risk allele. In addition, our data support the hypothesis proposed by Jablonski and Chaplin (Human skin pigmentation as an adaptation to UVB radiation.

Data on 3527 NMSC cases and 9391 controls were gathered through the M-SKIP Project, an international pooled-analysis on MC1R, skin cancer and phenotypic characteristics. We calculated summary odds ratios (SOR) with random-effect models, and performed stratified analyses.

We demonstrated that human melanocytes respond to alpha-melanocortin (alpha-MSH) or ACTH with increased proliferation and melanogenesis, and to agouti signaling protein by abrogation of these effects. alpha-MSH and ACTH were equipotent and more potent than beta-MSH, and gamma-MSH was the least potent in activating the MC1R and stimulating melanogenesis and proliferation of human melanocytes. We characterized the MC1R genotype in a panel of human melanocyte cultures and identified three cultures that were homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg151Cys and Asp294His, and heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His substitutions, respectively. Those cultures failed to respond to alpha-MSH with increase in cAMP levels, tyrosinase activity, or proliferation and had an exaggerated response to the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These loss-of-function mutations have been associated with red hair phenotype and increased risk for skin cancer. Melanocytes homozygous for Val29Met substitution in MC1R responded normally to alpha-MSH and UVB, suggesting that this variant is a polymorphism. We observed that alpha-MSH promotes human melanocyte survival by inhibiting the UV-induced apoptosis independently of melanin synthesis. This effect was absent in human melanocytes with loss of function MC1R mutations. We predict that the survival effect of alpha-MSH is caused by reduction of UV-induced DNA damage and contributes to the prevention of melanoma.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12006619": "Cutaneous pigmentation is determined by the amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesized by epidermal melanocytes and is known to protect against sun-induced DNA damage. The synthesis of eumelanin is stimulated by the binding of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) to the functional melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on melanocytes. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The importance of the MC1R gene in determining skin cancer risk led us to examine the impact of specific polymorphisms in this gene on the responses of human melanocytes to alpha-melanotropin and UV radiation. We compared the ability of human melanocyte cultures, each derived from a single donor, to respond to alpha-melanotropin with dose-dependent stimulation of cAMP formation, tyrosinase activity and proliferation. In each of those cultures the MC1R gene was sequenced, and the eumelanin and pheomelanin contents were determined. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His, or for Arg151Cys and Asp294His substitutions, but not melanocytes homozygous for Val92Met substitution, in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-melanotropin. Additionally, melanocytes with a non-functional MC1R demonstrated a pronounced increase in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of UV radiation compared with melanocytes expressing functional MC1R. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R gene sensitize human melanocytes to the DNA damaging effects of UV radiation, which may increase skin cancer risk.",

The R variants D84E, R142H, R151C, I155T, R160W and D294H were classified as damaging by the majority of the tools while the r variants V60L, V92M and R163Q have been predicted as neutral in most of the programs The combination of the prediction tools results in 14 nsSNPs indicated as the most damaging mutations in MC1R (L48P, R67W, H70Y, P72L, S83P, R151H, S172I, L206P, T242I, G255R, P256S, C273Y, C289R and R306H); C273Y showed to be highly damaging in SIFT, Polyphen-2, MutPred, PANTHER and PROVEAN scores. The computational analysis proved capable of identifying the potentially damaging nsSNPs in MC1R, which are candidates for further laboratory studies of the functional and pharmacological significance of the alterations in the receptor and the phenotypic outcomes.",

The major MC1R alleles in Holsteins are Dominant Black (MC1RD) and Recessive Red (MC1Re). A novel form of dominant red coat color was first observed in an animal born in 1980. The mutation underlying this phenotype was named Dominant Red and is epistatic to the constitutively activated MC1RD. Here we show that a missense mutation in the coatomer protein complex, subunit alpha (COPA), a gene with previously no known role in pigmentation synthesis, is completely associated with Dominant Red in Holstein dairy cattle. The mutation results in an arginine to cysteine substitution at an amino acid residue completely conserved across eukaryotes. Despite this high level of conservation we show that both heterozygotes and homozygotes are healthy and viable. Analysis of hair pigment composition shows that the Dominant Red phenotype is similar to the MC1R Recessive Red phenotype, although less effective at reducing eumelanin synthesis. RNA-seq data similarly show that Dominant Red animals achieve predominantly pheomelanin synthesis by downregulating genes normally required for eumelanin synthesis. COPA is a component of the coat protein I seven subunit complex that is involved with retrograde and cis-Golgi intracellular coated vesicle transport of both protein and RNA cargo. This suggests that Dominant Red may be caused by aberrant MC1R protein or mRNA trafficking within the highly compartmentalized melanocyte, mimicking the effect of the Recessive Red loss of function MC1R allele.",

Eleven studies on MC1R and melanoma, and 9 on MC1R and phenotype were included in the analysis. The 7 variants p.D84E, p.R142H, p.R151C, p.I155T, p.R160W, p. R163Q and p.D294H were significantly associated with melanoma development, with ORs (95%CI) ranging from 1.42 (1.09-1.85) for p.R163Q to 2.45 (1.32-4.55) for p.I155T. The MC1R variants p.R160W and p.D294H were associated both with red hair and fair skin, while p.D84E, p.R142H, and p.R151C were strongly associated with red hair only- ORs (95%CI) ranged from 2.99 (1.51-5.91) for p.D84E to 8.10 (5.82-11.28) for p.R151C. No association with melanoma or phenotype was found for p.V60L and p.V92M variants. In conclusion this meta-analysis provided evidence that some MC1R variants are associated both with melanoma and phenotype, while other are only associated with melanoma development. These results suggest that MC1R variants could play a role in melanoma development both via pigmentary and non-pigmentary pathways.",

Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis of MDSCs from LAL deficient mouse (lal-/-) revealed upregulation of Rab7 GTPase protein, which belongs to a superfamily of small-molecular-weight GTPase known to regulate intracellular membrane trafficking from early to late endosomes and lysosomes. Here, the physical protein-protein interaction between Rab7 GTPase and mTOR has been detected by co-immunoprecipitation in the cell extract of wild type HD1A and lal-/- MDSC-like HD1B myeloid cell lines. The GST pull down assay using the recombinant GST-Rab7 GTPase fusion protein showed that Rab7 GTPase interacts with the mTOR N-terminal heat repeat domain. Rab7 GTPase siRNA knocking down reversed the altered lysosome/mTOR distribution and expression levels in HD1B cells. Rab7 GTPase siRNA knocking down in isolated bone marrow lal-/- MDSCs or HD1B cells not only reduced over-activation of mTOR and its downstream effector S6, but also decreased glucose consumption, decreased ROS over-production, and increased healthy mitochondria by membrane potential measurement. Inhibition of Rab7 GTPase led to reduced lal-/- MDSCs differentiation from bone marrow Lin- progenitor cells, reduced lal-/- MDSCs trans-endothelial migration, and reversed lal-/- MDSCs suppression of T cell proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition of Rab7 GTPase reduced lal-/- MDSCs ability to stimulate tumor cell proliferation in vitro, tumor growth in vivo, and tumor invasion. Together, these results showed that Rab7 GTPase is critically involved in MDSCs homeostasis and pathogenic functions.",

We hypothesized that TOGs have distinct architectures and tubulin-binding properties that underlie each family's ability to promote microtubule polymerization or pause. As a model, we investigated the pentameric TOG array of a <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> XMAP215 member, Msps. We found that Msps TOGs have distinct architectures that bind either free or polymerized tubulin, and that a polarized array drives microtubule polymerization. An engineered TOG1-2-5 array fully supported Msps-dependent microtubule polymerase activity. Requisite for this activity was a TOG5-specific N-terminal HEAT repeat that engaged microtubule lattice-incorporated tubulin. TOG5-microtubule binding maintained mitotic spindle formation as deleting or mutating TOG5 compromised spindle architecture and increased the mitotic index. Mad2 knockdown released the spindle assembly checkpoint triggered when TOG5-microtubule binding was compromised, indicating that TOG5 is essential for spindle function. Our results reveal a TOG5-specific role in mitotic fidelity and support our hypothesis that architecturally distinct TOGs arranged in a sequence-specific order underlie TOG array microtubule regulator activity.",

The novel use of crystals of selenomethionine-labeled protein expressed in HeLa cells has facilitated the use of single anomalous X-ray scattering of this 4128 amino acid, multiple HEAT-repeat structure. The monitoring of the selenomethionines in the anomalous-difference density map has allowed the checking of the amino acid residue registration in the electron density, and the labeling of the Ku-C-terminal moiety with selenomethionine has further allowed its identification in the structure of the complex with DNA-PKcs.

Genome-wide association studies have suggested the less studied gene HEAT repeat-containing protein 1 (HEATR1) as a possible determinant of cellular sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we assessed this hypothesized link in PDAC, where HEATR1 expression is downregulated significantly. HEATR1 silencing in PDAC cells increased resistance to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutics, where this effect was associated with increased AKT kinase phosphorylation at the Thr308 regulatory site. Mechanistically, HEATR1 enhanced cell responsiveness to gemcitabine by acting as a scaffold to facilitate interactions between AKT and the protein phosphatase PP2A, thereby promoting Thr308 dephosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, treatment with the AKT inhibitor triciribine sensitized HEATR1-depleted PDAC cells to gemcitabine, suggesting that this therapeutic combination may overcome gemcitabine resistance in patients with low HEATR1 expression. Clinically, we found that HEATR1 downregulation in PDAC patients was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, poor response to tumor resection plus gemcitabine standard-of-care treatment, and shorter overall survival. Collectively, our findings establish HEATR1 as a novel regulator of AKT and a candidate predictive and prognostic indicator of drug responsiveness and outcome in PDAC patients.",

Two Tor-Lst8 heterodimers assemble further into a dyad-symmetry dimer mediated by Tor-Tor interactions. The first 1,300 residues of Tor form a HEAT repeat-containing \u03b1-solenoid with four distinct segments: a highly curved 800-residue N-terminal 'spiral', followed by a 400-residue low-curvature 'bridge' and an extended 'railing' running along the bridge leading to the 'cap' that links to FAT region. This complex topology was verified by domain insertions and offers a new interpretation of the mTORC1 structure. The spiral of one TOR interacts with the bridge of another, which together form a joint platform for the Regulatory Associated Protein of TOR (RAPTOR) regulatory subunit.",

Although this function is conserved in the distantly related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, recent studies, both in yeasts and in metazoans, reveal that Rif1 also functions more globally, both in the temporal control of DNA replication and in DNA repair. Rif1 proteins are large and characterized by N-terminal HEAT repeats, predicted to form an elongated alpha-helical structure. In addition, all Rif1 homologs contain two short motifs, abbreviated RVxF/SILK, that are implicated in recruitment of the PP1 (yeast Glc7) phosphatase. In yeasts the RVxF/SILK domains have been shown to play a role in control of DNA replication initiation, at least in part through targeted de-phosphorylation of proteins in the pre-Replication Complex. In human cells Rif1 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks through an interaction with 53BP1 where it counteracts DNA resection, thus promoting repair by non-homologous end-joining. This function requires the N-terminal HEAT repeat-containing domain. Interestingly, this domain is also implicated in DNA end protection at un-capped telomeres in yeast. We conclude by discussing the deployment of Rif1 at telomeres in yeasts from both an evolutionary perspective and in light of its recently discovered global functions.",

Earlier studies suggest that upon DNA damage, a specific B subunit, B56\u03b3, bridges the PP2A AC core to p53, leading to dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr-55, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21, and the inhibition of cell proliferation and transformation. In addition to dephosphorylation of p53, B56\u03b3-PP2A also inhibits cell proliferation and transformation by an unknown mechanism. B56\u03b3 contains 18 \u03b1-helices that are organized into eight HEAT (Huntington-elongation-A subunit-TOR) repeat motifs. Although previous crystal structure study has revealed the residues of B56\u03b3 that directly contact the A and C subunits, the contribution of HEAT repeats to holoenzyme assembly and to B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that HEAT repeat 1 is required for the interaction of B56\u03b3 with the PP2A AC core and, more importantly, for B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function. Within this region, we identified a tumor-associated mutation, C39R, which disrupts the interaction of B56\u03b3 with the AC core and thus was unable to mediate dephosphorylation of p53 by PP2A. Furthermore, due to its lack of AC interaction, C39R was also unable to promote the p53-independent tumor-suppressive function of B56\u03b3-PP2A. This study provides structural insight into the PP2A holoenzyme assembly and emphasizes the importance of HEAT repeat 1 in B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function.",

Unfolding of certain intermediates is, however, competitive, leading to parallel unfolding pathways. The low-stability, central repeats sample unfolded conformations under physiological conditions, suggesting how folding directs function: certain regions present rigid motifs for molecular recognition, whereas others have the flexibility with which to broaden the search area, as in the fly-casting mechanism. Partial unfolding of PR65/A also impacts catalysis by altering the proximity of bound catalytic subunit and substrate. Thus, the repeat array orchestrates the assembly and activity of PP2A.",

The HEAT-repeat protein Pds5B forms a curved structure around the nucleotide-binding domains of Smc1 and Smc3 and bridges the Smc3-Scc1 and SA1-Scc1 interfaces.

To this end, we investigated the effects of the inhibition of Cullin E3 ligases, by using inhibitors and knockdown techniques in HUVECs. Furthermore, we analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of the ligases by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The results revealed that NEDD8-conjugated Cullin 3 is required for VE-cadherin-mediated endothelial barrier functions. Treatment of HUVECs with MLN4924, a chemical inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme, led to high vascular permeability due to impaired cell-cell contact. Similar results were obtained when HUVECs were treated with siRNA directed against Cullin 3, one of the target substrates of NEDD8. Immunocytochemical staining showed that both treatments equally depleted VE-cadherin protein localized at the cell-cell borders. However, quantitative RT-PCR showed that there was no significant difference in the VE-cadherin mRNA levels between the treatment and control groups. In addition, cycloheximide chase assay revealed that the half-life of VE-cadherin protein was dramatically reduced by Cullin 3 depletion. Together, these findings suggest that neddylated Cullin 3 plays a crucial role in endothelial cell barrier function by regulating VE-cadherin.",

In NSCLC patients, an EGFR mutation is likely to be correlated with high levels of expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Here, we showed that osimertinib decreased PD-L1 expression in human EGFR mutant NSCLC cells in vitro. Osimertinib (125 nmol/L) markedly suppressed PD-L1 mRNA expression in both NCI-H1975 and HCC827 cells. Pretreatment with the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, osimertinib clearly decreased the production of new PD-L1 protein probably due to a reduction in mRNA. After blocking transcription and translation processes with actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively, osimertinib continued to reduce the expression of PD-L1, demonstrating that osimertinib might degrade PD-L1 at the post-translational level, which was confirmed by a cycloheximide chase assay, revealing that osimertinib (125 nmol/L) decreased the half-life of PD-L1 from approximately 17.8 h and 13.8 h to 8.6 h and 4.6 h, respectively, in NCI-H1975 and HCC827 cells. Pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitors (MG-132 or bortezomib) blocked the osimertinib-induced degradation of PD-L1, but an inhibitor of autophagy (chloroquine) did not. In addition, inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 by LiCl prevented osimertinib-induced PD-L1 degradation. The results demonstrate that osimertinib reduces PD-L1 mRNA expression and induces its protein degradation, suggesting that osimertinib may reactivate the immune activity of T cells in the tumor microenvironment in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.",

Among the various KLHL3 mutations that cause PHAII, we demonstrated that the R528H mutation in the Kelch domain decreased the binding to WNK4, thereby causing less ubiquitination and increased intracellular levels of WNK4. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of PHAII caused by other KLHL3 mutants remain to be determined. In this study, we examined the pathogenic effects of three PHAII-causing mutations in different KLHL3 domains; the protein levels of these mutants significantly differed when they were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. In particular, S410L expression was low even with increased plasmid expression. The cycloheximide chase assay revealed that an S410L mutation in the Kelch domain significantly decreased the intracellular stability. Mutations in E85A in the BTB domain and C164F in the BACK domain decreased the binding to CUL3, and S410L as well as R528H demonstrated less binding to WNK4. In vitro and in vivo assays revealed that these mutants decreased the ubiquitination and increased the intracellular levels of WNK4 compared with wild-type KLHL3. Therefore, the KLHL3 mutants causing PHAII investigated in this study exhibited less ability to ubiquitinate WNK4 because of KLHL3's low stability and/or decreased binding to CUL3 or WNK4.",

However, KLF8-interacting proteins remain largely unidentified. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), mass spectrometry, and GST pulldown assays, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a novel KLF8-interacting protein. Co-IP and Western blotting indicated that KLF8 is also a PARP-1 substrate. Mutation of the cysteines in the zinc finger domain of KLF8 abolished PARP-1 interaction. Surprisingly, immunofluorescent staining revealed a cytoplasmic mislocalization of KLF8 in PARP-1(-/-) cells or when the interaction was disrupted. This mislocalization was prevented by either PARP-1 re-expression or inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Interestingly, co-IP indicated competition between PARP-1 and CRM1 for KLF8 binding. Cycloheximide chase assay showed a decrease in the half-life of KLF8 protein when PARP-1 expression was suppressed or KLF8-PARP-1 interaction was disrupted. Ubiquitination assays implicated KLF8 as a target of ubiquitination that was significantly higher in PARP-1(-/-) cells. Promoter reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that KLF8 activation on the cyclin D1 promoter was markedly reduced when PARP-1 was deleted or inhibited or when KLF8-PARP-1 interaction was disrupted.

The SMURF2-interacting domains in KLF5 were mapped to its carboxyl terminus, including the PY motif of KLF5 and its zinc finger DNA-binding domain. KLF5 protein levels were reduced significantly upon overexpression of SMURF2 but not catalytically inactive SMURF2-C716A mutant or SMURF1. SMURF2 alone reduced the protein stability of KLF5 as shown by cycloheximide chase assay, indicating that SMURF2 specifically destabilizes KLF5. In contrast, KLF5(1-165), a KLF5 amino-terminal construct that lacks the PY motif and DNA binding domain, was not degraded by SMURF2. The degradation of KLF5 by SMURF2 was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and SMURF2 efficiently ubiquitinated both overexpressed and endogenous KLF5. In contrast, knocking down SMURF2 by siRNAs significantly enhanced KLF5 protein levels, reduced ubiquitination of KLF5, and increased the expression of cyclin D1 and PDGF-A, two established KLF5 target genes. In consistence, SMURF2, but not the E3 ligase mutant SMURF2-C716A, significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of KLF5, as demonstrated by dual luciferase assay using the PDGF-A promoter, and suppressed the ability of KLF5 to stimulate cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24097306": "There is growing interest in models of regulatory sequence evolution. However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located. Moreover, existing models do not account for the gene-specific roles of TF-binding sites, primarily because their roles often are not well understood. We introduce two models of regulatory sequence evolution that address some of the shortcomings of existing models and implement simulation frameworks based on them. One model simulates the evolution of an individual binding site in the context of a CRM, while the other evolves an entire CRM. Both models use a state-of-the art sequence-to-expression model to predict the effects of mutations on the regulatory output of the CRM and determine the strength of selection. We use the new framework to simulate the evolution of TF-binding sites in 37 well-studied CRMs belonging to the anterior-posterior patterning system in Drosophila embryos. We show that these simulations provide accurate fits to evolutionary data from 12 Drosophila genomes, which includes statistics of binding site conservation on relatively short evolutionary scales and site loss across larger divergence times. The new framework allows us, for the first time, to test hypotheses regarding the underlying cis-regulatory code by directly comparing the evolutionary implications of the hypothesis with the observed evolutionary dynamics of binding sites. Using this capability, we find that explicitly modeling self-cooperative DNA binding by the TF Caudal (CAD) provides significantly better fits than an otherwise identical evolutionary simulation that lacks this mechanistic aspect. This hypothesis is further supported by a statistical analysis of the distribution of intersite spacing between adjacent CAD sites. Experimental tests confirm direct homodimeric interaction between CAD molecules as well as self-cooperative DNA binding by CAD. We note that computational modeling of the D. melanogaster CRMs alone did not yield significant evidence to support CAD self-cooperativity.

The development of TSOACs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban has presented benefits and new challenges. One of the main challenges associated with the use of TSOACs is the lack of suitable agent-specific reversal agents. Several treatment options for the management of life-threatening bleeding events associated with TSOAC use, such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa, have been used, with inconsistent results. Currently, two potential reversal agents for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa and ciraparantag) are at various stages of clinical development. Idarucizumab, a reversal agent for the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, was approved by FDA in October 2015. Idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been reported to produce anticoagulation reversal effects within minutes of administration. Ciraparantag was demonstrated to decrease whole blood clotting time to within 10% of baseline values in 10 minutes or less, with a return to baseline hemostasis in 10-30 minutes. TSOAC reversal agents have been generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Idarucizumab and other TSOAC reversal agents, such as andexanet alfa and ciraparantag, present the potential for consistent and effective treatment and management options when life-threatening or uncontrolled TSOAC-associated bleeding occurs or when emergency surgery is warranted in patients using TSOACs.",

Any bleeding patient on an anticoagulant should be risk-stratified based on hemodynamic instability, source of bleeding, and degree of blood loss. Although minor bleed may be managed with discontinuation of anticoagulant, major bleed may require transfusion of blood products and use of specific antidote. The residual effects of each anticoagulant may be monitored with distinct coagulation assay. Intravenous or oral vitamin K can reverse the effect of warfarin within 24 to 48 hours and is indicated for any bleeding, international normalized ratio of &gt;10 or 4.5 to 10 in patients with other risk factors for bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) may be necessary in major bleeding related to warfarin. Protamine sulfate reverses the effect of unfractionated heparin completely and of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) partially. Idarucizumab has recently been approved in United States for dabigatran reversal, whereas andexanet alfa is expected to get approved in the near future for reversal of oral factor Xa inhibitors. The PCC may reverse the effect of rivaroxaban to some extent, but no data are available regarding reversal of apixaban and edoxaban.

Electron microscopy of these patients' skin suggests that tissue separation occurs intracellularly at the level of the hemidesmosomal inner plaque, which contains plectin, a high molecular weight cytoskeletal associated protein, also expressed in the sarcolemma of the muscle. In this study, we report two patients with EB-MD, each with a homozygous deletion mutation in the plectin gene, PLEC1. In the first case, the proband and her similarly affected sister had a homozygous 9 bp deletion mutation, designated as 2719de19, which resulted in elimination of three amino acids, QEA, in a sequence of 23 amino acids entirely conserved between the mouse and human sequences. The proband in the second family demonstrated a single nucleotide deletion at position 5866, designated as 5866delC, which resulted in frameshift and a premature termination codon for translation 16 bp downstream from the site of deletion. The absence of plectin in the hemidesmosomes, as reflected by negative immunofluorescence with an anti-plectin antibody (HD-1), associated with fragility of basal keratinocytes, implicates plectin as critical for binding of intermediate keratin filament network to hemidesmosomal complexes.

We demonstrated that in the skin, lack of plectin leads to failure of keratin filaments to connect to the plasma membrane via the hemidesmosomes, whereas in the muscle the deficient expression of the molecule correlates with an aberrant localization of desmin in the muscle fibers. In this study we demonstrate that in a MD-EBS kindred with two affected members, the disease results from a homozygous nonsense mutation in the plectin (PLEC1) gene leading to a premature stop codon (CGA to TGA) and decay of the aberrant plectin messenger RNA.

We analyzed a patient with compound heterozygosity for a 3-bp insertion at position 1287 leading to the insertion of leucine as well as the missense mutation Q1518X leading to a stop codon. The presence of plectin mRNA was demonstrated by a RNase protection assay. However, a marked reduction of plectin protein was found using immunofluorescence microscopy of the patient's skin and Western blot analysis of the patient's cultured keratinocytes.

KRT5 intronic regions that flanked each exon were sequenced and sets of facing intronic primers were designed for specific amplification of each of the nine KRT5 exons. Direct sequencing of KRT5-amplified exons identified three novel missense mutations. One mutation recurred in two unrelated patients with sporadic EBS. This glutamate to lysine substitution (E477K), located in the highly conserved KLLEGE motif at the end of the central rod domain, is the third recurrent mutation identified in dominant epidermolysis bullosa simplex disease.

Case Description An 11-day-old Japanese newborn infant was hospitalized because of herpetiform skin blistering on the feet, which expanded systemically after birth. There was no evidence of virus infection. The biopsied skin lesion showed a blister on the lamina densa without keratin clumps, indicating a diagnosis of EBS-generalized intermediate. We punctured the blisters to remove the contents daily, which led to no exacerbation or infection. The genetic study determined that the patient carried double substitutions of KRT5 c.1424A &gt; G (p.E475G) and KRT14 c.1237G &gt; A (p.A413T). The asymptomatic mother and sister carried the KRT14 substitution, but the healthy father had no substitution of the KRT gene.

Mutations were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Further, to explore possible correlations with function, the structural effects of the mutations in segment 2B of KRT5 and KRT14 and associated with EBS in our patients, as well as those reported previously, were modelled by molecular dynamics with the aid of the known crystal structure of the analogous segment of human vimentin. We have identified mutations in the KRT5 and KRT14 genes in 16 of 23 families affected by EBS in the Czech Republic. Eleven different sequence variants were found, of which four have not been reported previously. Novel mutations were found in two patients with the EBS-Dowling-Meara variant (EBS-DM) [KRT14-p.Ser128Pro and KRT14-p.Gln374_Leu387dup(14)] and in three patients with localized EBS (KRT14-p.Leu136Pro and KRT5-p.Val143Ala). Molecular dynamics studies show that the mutations p.Glu411del and p.Ile467Thr perturb the secondary alpha-helical structure of the mutated polypeptide chain, the deletion p.Glu411del in KRT14 has a strong but only local influence on the secondary structure of KRT14, and the structural impact of the mutation p.Ile467Thr in KRT5 is spread along the helix to the C-terminus. In all the other point mutations studied, the direct structural impact was significantly weaker and did not destroy the alpha-helical pattern of the secondary protein structure. The changes of 3-D structure of the KRT5/KRT14 dimer induced by the steric structural impact of the single point mutations, and the resulting altered inter- and intramolecular contacts, are spread along the protein helices to the protein C-terminus, but the overall alpha-helical character of the secondary structure is not destroyed and the atomic displacements induced by mutations cause only limited-scale changes of the quaternary structure of the dimer.

Pathogenic mutations that occur outside these hotspots are usually associated with less severe disease phenotypes. We describe a novel K5 mutation (V186L) that produces a conservative amino acid change (valine to leucine) at position 18 of the 1A helix. The phenotype of this case is unexpectedly severe for the location of the mutation, which lies outside the consensus helix initiation motif mutation hotspot, and other mutations at this position have been associated in Weber--Cockayne (mild) epidermolysis bullosa simplex only.

Moreover, we observed that the transglutaminase coagulation factor XIIIA (FXIIIA) was one of the most abundant proteins contained in the BMCMC releasates. Mast cell-deficient mice exhibited increased FXIIIA plasma and activity levels as well as reduced bleeding times, indicating that mast cells are more efficient in their ability to downregulate FXIIIA than in contributing to its amounts and functions in homeostatic conditions. We found that human chymase and mouse mast cell protease-4 (the mouse homologue of human chymase) had the ability to reduce FXIIIA levels and function via proteolytic degradation. Moreover, we found that chymase deficiency led to increased FXIIIA amounts and activity, as well as reduced bleeding times in homeostatic conditions and during sepsis.

MCs were found to directly respond to nonimmunodominant gliadin fragments by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Immunohistochemical characterization of infiltrating MCs and the effects of gliadin peptides on intestinal MCs indicated an increase in proinflammatory MC function in advanced stages of the disease.

Mast cell function during helminth infection was previously studied using mast cell-deficient Kit-mutant mice that display additional mast cell-unrelated immune deficiencies. Here, we use mice that lack basophils or mucosal and connective tissue mast cells in a Kit-independent manner to re-evaluate the impact of each cell type during helminth infection. Neither mast cells nor basophils participated in the immune response to tissue-migrating Strongyloides ratti third-stage larvae, but both cell types contributed to the early expulsion of parasitic adults from the intestine. The termination of S. ratti infection required the presence of mucosal mast cells: Cpa3<sup>Cre</sup> mice, which lack mucosal and connective tissue mast cells, remained infected for more than 150 days. Mcpt5<sup>Cre</sup> R-DTA mice, which lack connective tissue mast cells only, and basophil-deficient Mcpt8<sup>Cre</sup> mice terminated the infection after 1 month with wild-type kinetics despite their initial increase in intestinal parasite burden. Because Cpa3<sup>Cre</sup> mice showed intact Th2 polarization and efficiently developed protective immunity after vaccination, we hypothesize that mucosal mast cells are non-redundant terminal effector cells in the intestinal epithelium that execute anti-helminth immunity but do not orchestrate it.",

The activation of mast cells results in secretion of the preformed chemical mediators in their granules by a regulated process of exocytosis and leads to synthesis and secretion of lipid mediators and cytokines. Their soluble factors contribute to allergic inflammation. Mast cells are associated with hypersensitivity reactions, not only in the classical immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent mechanism but also in an IgE-independent manner. In particular, investigations of potential anatomical and functional interactions between mast cells and the nervous system have recently attracted great interest. To understand these molecular mechanisms in mast cell activation, the ability to visualize, track, and quantify molecules and events in living mast cells is an essential and powerful tool. Recent dramatic advances in imaging technology and labeling techniques have enabled us to carry out these tasks with high spatiotemporal resolution using confocal laser scanning microscopes, green fluorescent protein and its derivatives, and image analysis systems. Here we review our investigations of the dynamic processes of intracellular signaling molecules, cellular structure, and interactions with neurons in mast cells to provide basic and valuable information for allergy and clinical immunology using these new imaging methods.",

The specificity of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction is attributable to IgE molecules fixed to specific membrane receptors which, when stimulated by specific antigen, initiates the process of degranulation of the mast cell. The granules provide three separate sources of biologic activity: performed or primary mediators, newly generated or secondary mediators, and activities associated with the granular matrix. A number of biologic consequences are generated in response to these mediators and these include: increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, smooth muscle spasm, polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, stimulation of adenylate and guanylate cyclase, superoxide radical generation, prostaglandin formation, mucous and gastric acid secretion, hypotension, tissue destruction, and mononuclear leukocyte infiltration. This pharmacopia of activities accounts for the clinical aspects of allergic diseases, suggests that the mast cell granule may be involved in the host's defense against parasitic infections, and is compatible with a suggested role of the mast cell as a widely distributed, monocellular endocrine system.",

Mast cell differentiation in the marrow is activated as part of the body response to parasites. We will review here the mast cell differentiation pathway and what is known of its major intrinsic and extrinsic control mechanisms. It will also be described that thrombopoietin, the ligand for the Mpl receptor, in addition to its pivotal rule in the control of thrombocytopoiesis and of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell proliferation, exerts a regulatory function in mast cell differentiation.

In IgE-associated biological responses, the crosslinking of Fc&amp;#949;RI-bound IgE with multivalent antigens initiate the activation of mast cells by promoting aggregation of FceRI. This cross-linking receptor-bound IgE by multivalent Ag initiates a cascade of intracellular reactions leading to mediator release such as proinflammatory mediators, chemokines and cytokines.

However, there is no non-invasive method that can quantify the degree of implant-associated mast cell activation. Taking advantage of the fact that fibrin deposition is a hallmark of mast cell activation around biomaterial implants, a near infrared probe was fabricated to have high affinity to fibrin. Subsequent in vitro testing confirmed that this probe has high affinity to fibrin. Using a subcutaneous particle implantation model, we found significant accumulation of fibrin-affinity probes at the implant sites as early as 15 min following particle implantation. The accumulation of fibrin-affinity probes at the implantation sites could also be substantially reduced if anti-coagulant - heparin was administered at the implant sites. Further studies have shown that subcutaneous administration of mast cell activator - compound 48/80 - prompted the accumulation of fibrin-affinity probes. However, implant-associated fibrin-affinity probe accumulation was substantially reduced in mice with mast cell deficiency. The results show that our fibrin-affinity probes may serve as a powerful tool to monitor and measure the extent of biomaterial-mediated fibrin deposition and mast cell activation in vivo.",

In addition, it has been shown recently that mast cells also play a significant role in a life-saving host response to bacterial reactions. But as much as the immunopathological role of mast cells has been acknowledged, these cells have also aroused much controversy and confusion. By now it is clear that one explanation for the sometimes even contradictory opinions on mast cell function arise from mast cell heterogeneity. This heterogeneity can express itself as differences in histochemical, biochemical, and functional characteristics. In vitro systems provided a powerful tool for the investigation of the basic mechanisms for mast cell development and differentiation and helped to demonstrate that mast cell heterogeneity can be traced back to certain cytokine patterns that are present in different microenvironments. In this context it has also been shown that the growth factors required for human mast cell differentiation are somewhat different than those for rodents. In rodents, the atypical, T cell-dependent mucosal type mast cell can be distinguished from the T cell-independent connective tissue-type mast cell. In humans, the strict classification into mucosal and connective tissue-type mast cells is not possible and the content of mast cell-specific proteases chymase and tryptase is the main criterion for mast cell subtypes in humans. The large quantities of tryptase and chymase that are synthesized by mast cells suggest and emphasize the significance of these proteinases in mast cell function and stimulated investigations about the biological properties of these mast cell-specific proteases. Comparing their biological activities it becomes clear that they share some activities. On the other hand, tryptase seems to participate in proinflammatory mast cell function, whereas chymase seems to be more involved in inflammatory reactions. This review provides a short overview of the discovery, origin, development, and biological significance of mast cells and will then concentrate on mast cell heterogeneity in rodents and humans with respect to the mast cell proteases tryptase and chymase and their function.",

Here we demonstrate that SLC10A4, also referred to as the vesicular aminergic-associated transporter, VAAT, modifies mast cell degranulation. Strikingly, Slc10a4 <sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) had a significant reduction in the release of granule-associated mediators in response to IgE/antigen-mediated activation, whereas the in vitro development of mast cells, the storage of the granule-associated enzyme mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP-6), and the release of prostaglandin D2 and IL-6 were normal. Slc10a4-deficient mice had a strongly reduced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and a less intense itching behaviour in response to the mast cell degranulator 48/80. Live imaging of the IgE/antigen-mediated activation showed decreased degranulation and that ATP was retained to a higher degree in mast cell granules lacking SLC10A4. Furthermore, ATP was reduced by two thirds in Slc10a4 <sup>-/-</sup> BMMCs supernatants in response to IgE/antigen. We speculate that SLC10A4 affects the amount of granule-associated ATP upon IgE/antigen-induced mast cell activation, which affect the release of granule-associated mast cell mediators. In summary, SLC10A4 acts as a regulator of degranulation in vitro and of mast cell-related reactions in vivo.",

There is little information relating to the chemotaxins responsible for mast cell epithelial accumulation in this disease. Expression of the mast cell chemoattractants TGF-beta, eotaxin, and stem cell factor and their receptors was investigated in tissue sections from biopsy specimens obtained from patients with naturally occurring allergic rhinitis. Specific immunohistochemical staining was performed on thin sections of inferior turbinate biopsy specimens from patients with perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis and, for comparison, from nonatopic and, where relevant, atopic healthy volunteers without rhinitis. Sequential staining of adjacent 2-microm sections was undertaken to colocalize TGF-beta receptors to mast cells. Evidence was found of significantly increased epithelial immunoreactivity for TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TGF-beta receptor I, TGF-beta receptor II, and TGF-beta receptor III in patients with perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis compared with that seen in healthy control subjects. TGF-beta receptors I and II were found to colocalize to mast cells. Eotaxin epithelial immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the perennial group, although there were no corresponding disease-related differences found in relation to CCR-3 immunoreactivity at this site. There was no increase in stem cell factor immunoreactivity within the epithelium in naturally occurring disease. Significant correlations were found between epithelial immunoreactivity for TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta receptor I, TGF-beta receptor II, and the number of epithelial mast cells. These findings of enhanced epithelial TGF-beta immunoreactivity in patients with rhinitis, the correlation with intraepithelial mast cell numbers, and the colocalization of TGF-beta receptors to mast cells suggest that the epithelial expression of TGF-beta might represent an important biologic process involved in either the recruitment or retention of mast cells within the epithelium in naturally occurring allergic rhinitis.",

When appropriately activated, mast cells undergo degranulation, a process by which these preformed granule compounds are rapidly released into the surroundings. In many cases, the effects that mast cells have on an immune response are closely associated with the biological actions of the granule compounds that they release, as exemplified by the recent studies showing that mast cell granule proteases account for many of the protective and detrimental effects of mast cells in various inflammatory settings.

Mast cells express a variety of phenotypic features within tissues as determined by the local environment. Withdrawal of required growth factors results in mast cell apoptosis. Mast cells appear to be highly engineered cells with multiple critical biological functions. They may be activated by a number of stimuli that are both Fc epsilon RI dependent and Fc epsilon RI independent. Activation through various receptors leads to distinct signaling pathways. After activation, mast cells may immediately extrude granule-associated mediators and generate lipid-derived substances that induce immediate allergic inflammation. Mast cell activation may also be followed by the synthesis of chemokines and cytokines. Cytokine and chemokine secretion, which occurs hours later, may contribute to chronic inflammation.

A number of studies, however, have demonstrated that mast cells play a beneficial role in innate host defense against bacterial infections. Since mast cells clearly play both physiological and pathophysiological functions in the body, it is important to learn about the components of mast cells that drive these responses. The functional roles of mast cell in vivo have been principally characterized by comparing the biological responses in mast cell-deficient mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)), their normal wild-type littermates (WBB6F(1)-+/+) and mast cell deficient mice reconstituted locally or systemically with mast cells cultured from the bone marrow cells of WBB6F(1)-+/+ mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)+MC).

It has previously been suggested that after IgE-mediated degranulation mast cells can undergo regranulation. Such a process is probably of great importance with respect to the severity and perpetuation of the allergic response. Our purpose was to investigate whether mast cells recover from degranulation and whether they still have the potential to release a granule-associated mediator and upregulate certain cytokine genes. Mouse mast cells were repeatedly activated by IgE and specific antigen with a 24-hour or 48-hour interval. During each of the 2 activation stages, release of beta-hexosaminidase was measured by means of enzymatic colorimetric analysis, and IL-13 and IL-6 mRNA was detected by ribonuclease protection assay. Both scanning electron microscopy and time-lapse photography were used to reveal the process of mast cell recovery. We found that re-activation of degranulated mast cells in response to high-affinity IgE-receptor cross-linkage triggers beta-hexosaminidase release and upregulation of IL-13 and IL-6 gene expression levels similar to what is seen in the initial activation. Scanning electron microscopy documented cells at various stages during the recovery process 30 minutes after the activation. With time-lapse photography, a single cell that had undergone degranulation could be visualized consecutively during its recovery process. Mast cells can recover after an IgE-mediated activation and can repeatedly release beta-hexosaminidase and express IL-6 and IL-13 mRNA after re-activation.",

Here we report what we believe to be a novel way to activate mast cells with CD30 that leads to degranulation-independent secretion of chemokines. CD30 induced a de novo synthesis and secretion of the chemokines IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta, a process involving the MAPK/ERK pathway. Mast cells were found to be the predominant CD30 ligand-positive (CD30L-positive) cell in the chronic inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and both CD30 and CD30L expression were upregulated in lesional skin in these conditions. Furthermore, the number of IL-8-positive mast cells was elevated both in psoriatic and atopic dermatitis lesional skin as well as in ex vivo CD30-treated healthy skin organ cultures. In summary, characterization of CD30 activation of mast cells has uncovered an IgE-independent pathway that is of importance in understanding the entirety of the role of mast cells in diseases associated with mast cells and CD30 expression.

The human skin, constantly exposed to UV radiation, particularly the UVB and UVA components, is vulnerable to its various deleterious effects such as erythema, photoaging, immunosuppression and cancer. To counteract these and for the maintenance of genomic integrity, cells have developed several protective mechanisms including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Whereas the sun protection factor (SPF) provides an index of protection against erythemally effective solar UV, largely confined to the UVB (290-320 nm) and short-wavelength UVA (320-340 nm) region, there is currently no agreed-upon method to measure broad-spectrum protection against long-wavelength UVA (340-400 nm). The objective of these studies was to assess the potential of in vitro UV substrate spectrophotometry and subsequent calculation of the \"critical wavelength\" value as a measure of broad-spectrum UV protection and as a routine, practical procedure for classification of sunscreen products. The spectral absorption of 59 commercially available sunscreen products and multiple experimental formulas with one or more UV filters was measured. Sunscreen product, 1 mg/cm(2), was applied to a hydrated synthetic collagen substrate, preirradiated with a solar simulator, and then subjected to UV substrate spectrophotometry. Multiple determinations from 5 independent samples per product were used to calculate the critical wavelength value, defined as the wavelength at which the integral of the spectral absorbance curve reached 90% of the integral from 290 to 400 nm. We found that a recognized long-wave UVA active ingredient such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, or avobenzone is a necessary but insufficient product requirement for achieving the highest proposed broad-spectrum classification, that is, critical wavelength of 370 nm or more. Although SPF and critical wavelength are largely independent of each other, UVA absorbance must increase commensurate with SPF to maintain the same critical wavelength value. Substrate spectrophotometry and the calculation of critical wavelength can readily account for sunscreen photostability by UV preirradiation. Finally, there is also a strong positive relationship between critical wavelength and a currently available in vivo measure of UVA protection. Determination of critical wavelength by means of UV substrate spectrophotometry provides a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable measure of broad-spectrum protection, which is largely independent of SPF, yet ensures long-wavelength UVA protection commensurate with SPF. The procedure provides a routine, sensitive means of differentiating and classifying sunscreen products and, importantly, obviates the need to subject volunteers to acute exposures of high-dose, nonterrestrial UV, the health risks of which are still poorly understood.",

There are some conventional, time-tested explanations of atrial fibrillation genesis, however some uncertainty of its complete understanding still exists. We focused on atrial ischemia which, hypothetically, could be responsible for manifestation of the arrhythmia, irrespective of the underlying heart disease. Evidences abounds that atrial fibrillation has an extremely strong association with nutritional/oxidative status of myocardium. This arrhythmia seemingly may stem from the electrophysiological differences taking place in the boundary areas. To validate such assumptions we have surveyed widely accepted theories based on clinical and experimental evidence. There was an attempt to integrate some well-known theoretical explanations (focal, multifocal, ectopic, reentrant activity, atrial remodeling, etc.) into a new conceptually systematized arrhythmogenesis. Confronting ischemic and non-ischemic atrial zones electrophysiologically on their borderlines presumably creates a substrate vulnerable to the development of atrial fibrillation. The behavior of these interrelated areas is likely ischemia-dependent; the separating borderline(s) may be treated as conflictogenic, releasing triggers/drivers to commence and to perpetuate the arrhythmia. Ischemically damaged and non-damaged myocardial areas likely participate in the relay-race carousel of arrhythmogenicity due to their mutual interactions, accompanied by the \"fireworks\" at the separating borderlines. It could be concluded that myocardial ischemia as a nonspecific proarrhythmic factor presumably plays a key role in the genesis and sustenance of atrial fibrillation. Theoretically the most important step in eradication of arrhythmogenic substrate might be an overall abolition of ischemia regardless of the characteristics of underlying heart disease.

AF is associated with an increased incidence of mortality, stroke, and coronary events compared to sinus rhythm. AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause a tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Immediate direct-current (DC) cardioversion should be performed in patients with AF and acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be administered to reduce immediately a very rapid ventricular rate in AF. An oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be used in persons with AF if a fast ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drugs. Digoxin should not be used to treat patients with paroxysmal AF. Nondrug therapies should be performed in patients with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drugs. Paroxysmal AF associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be treated with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in patients with AF and symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with ventricular pauses greater than 3 seconds which are not drug-induced. Elective DC cardioversion has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than does medical cardioversion in converting AF to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal echocardiography has shown no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective DC or drug cardioversion of AF and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer, especially in elderly patients , ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than maintaining sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0.

Drug-induced tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or atrial tachyarrhythmias with rapid ventricular response) are life-threatening and often cause syncope. Because these events tend to cluster shortly after drug initiation, it is common practice to routinely hospitalize patients for drug initiation under continuous electrocardiographic surveillance. The low incidence of serious proarrhythmia makes the cost-effectiveness of this practice controversial. Torsades de pointes, in particular, can be predicted by the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: female gender, structural heart disease, prolonged baseline QT interval, bradycardia, hypokalemia, previous proarrhythmic responses, and higher drug plasma levels. Proarrhythmia induced by class IC agents is seen almost exclusively in patients with structural heart disease and ventricular dysfunction. A variety of monitoring devices permit electrocardiographic monitoring of patients in the outpatient setting. Efficient clinical pathways for the safe initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation do not require universal hospital admission. In patients without structural heart disease, outpatient initiation of most antiarrhythmic drugs appears safe. In patients with significant structural heart disease, class IC drugs are contraindicated, and most other drugs should be initiated in the hospital under continuous monitoring. The incidence of severe proarrhythmia is very low when loading doses of amiodarone of 600 mg/d or less are given to outpatients with structural heart disease.",

In the last 10-15 years, significant advances in the treatment of heart failure have improved survival, whereas effective management of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients still awaits similar progress. Empirically, two strategies have evolved for treatment of atrial fibrillation: 1) rhythm control, which means conversion to sinus rhythm and maintenance of sinus rhythm; and 2) rate control, which means reduction of heart rate to an acceptable frequency. It is unknown whether one of these strategies is better than the other. In this review the authors discuss the prevalence, impact, and treatment of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11975840": "The prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation increase with age. Atrial fibrillation is associated with a higher incidence of coronary events, stroke, and mortality than sinus rhythm. A fast ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation may cause tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Management of atrial fibrillation includes treatment of underlying causes and precipitating factors. Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in persons with atrial fibrillation associated with acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem may be used to immediately slow a fast ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation. An oral beta-blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be given to persons with atrial fibrillation if a rapid ventricular rate occurs a rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected persons with symptomatic life-threatening atrial fibrillation refractory to other drug therapy. Nondrug therapies should be performed in persons with symptomatic atrial fibrillation in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drug therapy. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be managed with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in persons with atrial fibrillation in whom symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with non-drug-induced ventricular pauses longer than 3 seconds develop. Elective direct-current cardioversion has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than medical cardioversion in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal echocardiography shows no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective direct-current or drug cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer the treatment strategy of ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs, especially in older patients. Digoxin should not be used in persons with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Persons with atrial fibrillation who are at low risk for stroke or who have contraindications to warfarin should receive 325 mg aspirin daily.",

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Its incidence increases with age and the presence of structural heart disease. It is a major cause of stroke, especially in the elderly. Although the established principles of evaluation and management of cardiac arrhythmias apply to all age groups, management in the elderly patient is especially challenging because of increased risk of interventional and pharmacologic therapies, altered pharmacokinetics of drugs, and sometimes unclear long-term benefits in the older patient.",

We retrospectively reviewed 64 cases with idiopathic acute atrial fibrillation and 64 age- and sex-matched controls, randomly selected from among general medical admissions. Sixty-two percent of cases and 33% of controls had documentation as heavy users of alcohol. Furthermore, patients with alcohol-related atrial fibrillation were significantly more likely to manifest alcohol withdrawal syndrome than were other inpatients with heavy alcohol use. Patients with alcohol-related acute atrial fibrillation were not different from other patients with acute atrial fibrillation with respect to clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, electrocardiographic abnormalities, cardiomegaly, electrolyte disturbance, or response to therapy. Heavy alcohol use is an important potential etiology for acute atrial fibrillation; alcohol withdrawal may represent a particular risk for such alcohol-related atrial fibrillation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2200378": "The risk of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is largely related to the underlying disorders responsible for the arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease has the highest stroke risk (about 17 times greater than unaffected controls), but even with nonvalvular heart disease, the risk is increased fivefold. The stroke risk is greater with chronic than with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, is highest in the year after onset of the arrhythmia, and is lower in younger patients with idiopathic (\"lone\") atrial fibrillation. Major bleeding episodes, the most important risk of anticoagulation, occur in about 5% to 10% of patients. The decision to anticoagulate a patient with atrial fibrillation depends on the cause of the arrhythmia, especially any associated cardiovascular disease, and the individual's risk from anticoagulation. Growing evidence supports the effectiveness of anticoagulation of most patients with nonvalvular, as well as valvular, cardiac disease for the prevention of both primary and recurrent strokes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7846937": "Chronic atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia affecting 2 to 4% of the population older than 60 years of age. Atrial fibrillation may cause disabling symptoms and serious adverse effects, such as impairment of cardiac function or thromboembolic events. It is also associated with an increased risk of death. In the past, the most common underlying heart disease related to chronic atrial fibrillation was rheumatic heart disease. Today, this disease occurs relatively rarely. Nevertheless, the incidence of atrial fibrillation is likely to increase in the future due to the aging of the population, since its prevalence increases with age. In most patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, the arrhythmia can be attributed to organic heart disease or metabolic disorders. In western countries ischemic and hypertensive heart disease (including sick sinus syndrome) and alcohol (holiday heart syndrome) are numerically more important than the classical causes of atrial fibrillation--rheumatic heart disease and thyrotoxicosis--which are declining in incidence. Overall, atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased mortality. In about 15% of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, no underlying cardiac or metabolic abnormality can be found, also the arrhythmia can itself give right to atrial dilatation. Atrial fibrillation consists most probably of several coexisting reentrant wave fronts of activation within the atria. Atrial activation and atrial fibrillation is as follows: multiple wavelets sweep round the atria in irregular, shifting patterns; completed reentrant circuits are the exception. Atrial flutter in its common form is characterized by evidence of atrial activity at a rate of 250-350 bpm, and usually almost exactly 300 bpm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395441": " Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by cardiac rhythm disorders. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia in adult population [1, 2]. According to some of the large epidemiological studies diabetes mellitus is among independent risk factors for development and persistence of atrial fibrillation [3]. Both diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation independently increase the risk of thromboembolism, especially of stroke [3-5]. It is obvious that rhythm control, i.e. restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, may be essential for prevention of thromboembolism in these patients. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of diabetes mellitus on rhythm control in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. We analysed the impact of diabetes mellitus and other clinical and echocardiographic parameters (age, gender, current arrhythmia duration, presence of previous episodes of persistent atrial fibrillation, cardiac and/or noncardiac diseases, left atrial diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction) on outcome of attempted cardioversion in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation admitted to Cardiologic Department of the Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, between January 1992 and December 1999. We also analysed retrospectively the impact of diabetes mellitus and other parameters listed above on the presence of previous episodes of atrial fibrillation in our patients, that at our opinion reflected the possibilities of sinus rhythm maintenance in these patients. All continuous parameters were expressed as mean value and standard deviation. Statistical significance of differences between variables was examined using Chi-square test. For identification of independent predictors of examined outcomes we used multiple logistic regression model with 95% of confidence interval. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programme. Of 378 patients with currently persistent atrial fibrillation, aged mean 53.98 +/- 11.69 years, there were 266 (70.4%) men. Diabetes mellitus was previously diagnosed in 27 (7.1%) patients, cardiac diseases in 223 (59.0%), noncardiac diseases in 47 (12.4%) and 140 (37.0%) patients had \"lone\" atrial fibrillation. Left atrial enlargement was noted in 224 (59.3%) patients, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 82 (21.7%). Atrial fibrillation lasted 48 hours to 9 years, mean 8.5 +/- 18.14 months before cardioversion. While 43 patients had previous episodes of persistent AF for last 1-30 years, mean 10.5 +/- 7.3,335 patients never experienced AF before. There was a statistically significant difference in percent of diabetic patients (18.6%/43 vs. 5.7%/335, value of Chi-square test = 7.759, p &lt; 0.01) in these two groups. We analysed the impact of diabetes mellitus on outcome of attempted cardioversion and on presence of previous episodes of AF reflecting the success in maintaining sinus rhythm. Multiple logistic regression models for all of 378 patients, with dependent variable being present in previous recurrent atrial fibrillations and independent variables of clinical and echocardiographic parameters as listed, identified diabetes mellitus to be an independent predictor of repeated atrial fibrillations with relative risk of 4.6 (CI 95%). When dependent variable in the same model was outcome of cardioversion (sinus rhythm is restored in 281/378 patients--74%) diabetes mellitus was not among independent predictors of successful cardioversion. The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus is not completely understood, including the impact of known complications of diabetes mellitus on electrophysiological properties of atrial myocardium and development of atrial fibrillation [6]. Besides being the independent risk factor for occurrence of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, according to our results, appears to influence the possibilities of maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of permanent atrial fibrillation in diabetic patients. We found that patients with diabetes mellitus and persistent atrial fibrillation may be successfully converted to sinus rhythm like any other group of patients, but the presence of diabetes mellitus increases the risk of arrhythmia recurrence for 4.6 times compared to patients without diabetes mellitus. Obviously, diabetic patients need to be treated with more efficacious antiarrhythmics from the very beginning, including amiodarone, which successfully prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation in the majority of patients [7, 8]. We concluded that diabetes mellitus independently predicts the presence of recurrent atrial fibrillation but does not influence the possibility of sinus rhythm restoration. The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus needs further investigation.",

Approximately, 30% of ischaemic strokes remain cryptogenic despite improved imaging modalities and technological improvements to identify their cause. Of the long list of various cardiac conditions associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic strokes, non-valvular atrial fibrillation is the most common cause. Unsurprisingly, the stroke risk associated with these conditions is highly variable and non-homogenous, with many risk factors additive to the overall risk profile. Treatment with vitamin K-antagonists substantially reduces the long-term complications associated with cardioembolism in some high-risk patients, for example, in atrial fibrillation. Careful selection of antithrombotic drug regime needs to be carried out in patients individually to minimise the risk of bleeding encountered with such therapy. Apart from atrial fibrillation, there is relatively limited evidence for the role of antithrombotic therapy for other cardiac conditions associated with cardioembolism and how long one should treat.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216701": "Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression. As a transcription factor, p53 mainly exerts its tumor suppressive function through transcriptional regulation of many target genes. To maintain the proper function of p53, p53 protein level and activity are exquisitely controlled by a group of positive and negative regulators in cells. Thus, p53, its regulators, and regulated genes form a complicated p53 signaling network. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules. miRNAs play an important role in regulation of gene expression by blocking translational protein synthesis and/or degrading target mRNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated that p53 and its network are regulated by miRNAs at multiple levels. Some miRNAs regulate the level and function of p53 through directly targeting p53, whereas some other miRNAs target regulators of p53, such as MDM2 and MDM4, to indirectly regulate the activity and function of p53. On the other hand, p53 also regulates the transcriptional expression and the biogenesis of a group of miRNAs, which contributes to the tumor suppressive function of p53. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Many tumor-associated mutant p53, which have \"gain-of-function\" activities in tumorigenesis independently of wild type p53, can regulate the expression of different miRNAs and modulate the biogenesis of specific miRNAs to promote tumorigenesis. These findings have demonstrated that miRNAs are important regulators and mediators of p53 and its signaling pathway, which highlights a pivotal role of miRNAs in the p53 network and cancer. J. Cell.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28140789": "The way cells respond to DNA damage is important since inefficient repair or misrepair of lesions can have deleterious consequences, including mutation, genomic instability, neurodegenerative disorders, premature aging, cancer or death. Whether damage occurs spontaneously as a byproduct of normal metabolic processes, or after exposure to exogenous agents, cells muster a coordinated, complex DNA damage response (DDR) to mitigate potential harmful effects. A variety of activities are involved to promote cell survival, and include DNA repair, DNA damage tolerance, as well as transient cell cycle arrest to provide time for repair before entry into critical cell cycle phases, an event that could be lethal if traversal occurs while damage is present. When such damage is prolonged or not repairable, senescence, apoptosis or autophagy is induced. One major level of DDR regulation occurs via the orchestrated transcriptional control of select sets of genes encoding proteins that mediate the response. p53 is a transcription factor that transactivates specific DDR downstream genes through binding DNA consensus sequences usually in or near target gene promoter regions. The profile of p53-regulated genes activated at any given time varies, and is dependent upon type of DNA damage or stress experienced, exact composition of the consensus DNA binding sequence, presence of other DNA binding proteins, as well as cell context. RAD9 is another protein critical for the response of cells to DNA damage, and can also selectively regulate gene transcription. The limited studies addressing the role of RAD9 in transcription regulation indicate that the protein transactivates at least one of its target genes, p21/waf1/cip1, by binding to DNA sequences demonstrated to be a p53 response element. NEIL1 is also regulated by RAD9 through a similar DNA sequence, though not yet directly verified as a bonafide p53 response element. These findings suggest a novel pathway whereby p53 and RAD9 control the DDR through a shared mechanism involving an overlapping network of downstream target genes. Details and unresolved questions about how these proteins coordinate or compete to execute the DDR through transcriptional reprogramming, as well as biological implications, are discussed.",

In Panama, Leishmania parasites are endemic, causing thousands of new cases every year, mostly of the cutaneous form. In the last years, the burden of the disease has increased, coincident with increasing disturbances in its natural sylvatic environments. The study of genetic variation in parasites is important for a better understanding of the biology, population genetics, and ultimately the evolution and epidemiology of these organisms. Very few attempts have been made to characterize genetic polymorphisms of parasites isolated from Panamanian patients of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Here we present data on the genetic variability of local isolates of Leishmania, as well as specimens from several other species, by means of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), a technique seldom used to study genetic makeup of parasites. We demonstrate that this technique allows detection of very high levels of genetic variability in local isolates of Leishmania panamensis in a highly reproducible manner. The analysis of AFLP fingerprints generated by unique selective primer combinations in L. panamensis suggests a predominant clonal mode of reproduction. Using fluorescently labeled primers, many taxon-specific fragments were identified which may show potential as species diagnostic fragments. The AFLP permitted a high resolution genetic analysis of the Leishmania genus, clearly separating certain groups among L. panamensis specimens and highly related species such as L. panamensis and L. guyanensis. The phylogenetic networks reconstructed from our AFLP data are congruent with established taxonomy for the genus Leishmania, even when using single selective primer combinations.

We investigate here the possibility that the cutaneous form of L. donovani can provide immunological protection against the visceral form of the disease, as a potential explanation for why visceral leishmaniasis is rare in Sri Lanka. Subcutaneous immunization with a cutaneous clinical isolate from Sri Lanka was significantly protective against visceral leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice.

The different clinical forms of leishmaniasis are caused by more than twenty species of Leishmania that are transmitted by nearly thirty species of phlebotomine sand flies. Pentavalent antimonials (such as Pentostam or Glucantime) are the first line drugs for treating leishmaniasis. Recent studies suggest that pentavalent antimony (Sb(V)) acts as a pro-drug, which is converted to the more active trivalent form (Sb(III)). However, sensitivity to trivalent antimony varies among different Leishmania species. In general, Leishmania species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are more sensitive to Sb(III) than the species responsible for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Leishmania aquaglyceroporin (AQP1) facilitates the adventitious passage of antimonite down a concentration gradient. In this study, we show that Leishmania species causing CL accumulate more antimonite, and therefore exhibit higher sensitivity to antimonials, than the species responsible for VL. This species-specific differential sensitivity to antimonite is directly proportional to the expression levels of AQP1 mRNA. We show that the stability of AQP1 mRNA in different Leishmania species is regulated by their respective 3'-untranslated regions. The differential regulation of AQP1 mRNA explains the distinct antimonial sensitivity of each species.",

A total of 180 small mammals were trapped in 2003 and 2006 in a rural area in north-eastern Brazil. Spleen and skin samples from these animals were assessed by two PCR protocols, one targeting Leishmania (Viannia) spp. and other Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. Additionally, serum samples were tested by an immunochromatographic test with rK39 as antigen. Overall, 23.2% (38/164) of the animals were positive to L. (V.) spp. and 8.8% (14/160) to L.

So there is an urgent need of development of new drug targets to fight against leishmaniasis. In this regard we have selected Leishmania donovani Ca2+ ion channel (Ld-CC) as potential drug target. Ld-CC regulates concentration of Ca2+ ions which is involved in several functions like flagellar motion, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and entry inside the macrophages. Since Ld-CC has not been characterised yet, we performed homology modelling of Leishmania donovani Ca2+ ion channel (Ld-CC) and docking studies of ligand library against this channel. 542 compound library of National Cancer Institute (NCI) diversity 3 dataset selected for screening studies. The ligands ZINC17287336 and ZINC29590262 were selected as best energy conformers because they show highest binding affinity towards its target (Ld-CC). They interact with the active site residues in the pocket of Ld-CC which suggests that the docked conformations are good and acceptable. Moreover, these two selected compounds also have relatively high binding affinity than nifedipine and verapamil, known human calcium channel blockers which had been reported to have mild anti-leishmanial activity. Among these two top screened inhibitors the ligand ZINC29590262 shows poor binding affinity towards the Human voltagedependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1C in comparison to the Ld-CC. Therefore, we proposed this ligand as the best inhibitor which shows 40% more binding affinity with Ld-CC than the human-VDCC.

Miltefosine is currently the latest and only oral antileishmanial that came out of drug discovery pipelines in the past few decades, but recent reports indicate a significant decline in its efficacy against visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar) in the Indian subcontinent. This relapse rate of up to 20% within 12 months after treatment was shown not to be related to reinfection, drug quality, drug exposure, or drug-resistant parasites. We therefore aimed to assess other phenotypes of the parasite that may affect treatment outcome and found a significant association between the number of metacyclic parasites, parasite infectivity, and patient treatment outcome in the Indian subcontinent. Together with previous studies on resistance of L. donovani against pentavalent antimonials, these data suggest that the infectivity of the parasite, or related phenotypes, might be a more determinant factor for treatment failure in visceral leishmaniasis than drug susceptibility, warranting a reassessment of our current view on treatment failure and drug resistance in leishmaniasis and beyond. The high miltefosine relapse rate poses a major challenge for the current Kala-Azar Elimination Program in the Indian subcontinent and other leishmaniasis control programs worldwide. This relapse rate could not be related to reinfection, drug-resistant parasites, or reduced treatment quality. Here we report that an increased infectivity of the parasite is associated with miltefosine relapse of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. These results supplement those obtained with antimonial-resistant L. donovani where an increased infectivity was also observed. This challenges the current view of Leishmania drug susceptibility being the biggest parasitic factor that contributes to treatment failure in leishmaniasis.

As drug therapy for leishmaniasis is toxic and resistance is growing, a vaccine is an important weapon against this disease. Unfortunately, no effective vaccine exists for any human parasitic infection. Worse yet, nearly all effective vaccines whose mechanisms are known work through the induction of protective antibodies. Leishmania mexicana causes primarily chronic cutaneous disease. Not only are antibodies not effective at killing Leishmania, as it hides inside the parasitophorous vacuole of the host cell, but new research indicates that IgG antibodies may be crucial in suppressing the host immune response by generating an immunosuppressive interleukin-10 response. IL-10 is able to decrease the needed Th1-generated IFN-gamma and downregulates production of nitric oxide, a required effector mechanism of parasite killing. We have been studying the pathways that the host uses to partially control L. mexicana infection, which include STAT4, IFN-gamma, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, but found that the IL-12 pathway is suppressed by IL-10. We are now studying the mechanisms by which IgG, bound to parasites, can induce IL-10 through FcgammaR ligation and how this suppresses a healing immune response. We are examining which IgG isotypes bind to which FcgammaRs and whether macrophages are the necessary source of IL-10 for chronic disease. Elucidation of these mechanisms may help us to design vaccines that will not induce antibody-mediated immunosuppressive IL-10 responses.",

L. braziliensis is more virulent, because it can cause mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, known as espundia, that results in severe facial destruction. Early identification of the species that causes the initial cutaneous infection would greatly help to prevent mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, because it would allow more aggressive treatment and follow-up. However, because of the close genetic similarity of L. braziliensis and L. peruviana, there currently exists no simple assay to distinguish between these species. We cloned the mannose phosphate isomerase gene from both L. braziliensis and L. peruviana. It is the only known isoenzyme capable of differentiating between L. braziliensis and L. peruviana in multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Interestingly, only a single nucleotide polymorphism was found between the mannose phosphate isomerase genes from L. braziliensis and L. peruviana, resulting in an amino acid change from threonine to arginine at amino acid 361. A polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to distinguish the single nucleotide polymorphism of the mannose phosphate isomerase gene to allow for the specific identification of L. braziliensis or L. peruviana. This assay was validated with 31 reference strains that were previously typed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, successfully applied to patient biopsy samples, and adapted to a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.

All articles were considered for inclusion in the review. Pertinent information was selected for discussion. All NSAIDs can prolong bleeding time by inhibiting platelet function. High-dose aspirin has a direct hypoprothrombinemic effect. Phenylbutazone and its analogs enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin through a pharmacokinetic interaction by inhibiting the hepatic metabolism of warfarin. Mefenamic acid also enhances the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, but the mechanism is not known. The clinical relevance of protein binding displacement in the interaction between warfarin and NSAIDs has been overstated, although a significant one may be more likely in the presence of high concentrations of NSAIDs in patients with slow elimination of warfarin (e.g., those with severe heart failure or impaired liver function). NSAIDs can induce gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely to be more severe if warfarin is also given. The combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs is generally discouraged because of the increased risk of bleeding in these patients. In patients receiving warfarin who also require NSAIDs, phenylbutazone and its analogs, high-dose aspirin, mefenamic acid, excessive use of topical methyl salicylate, and NSAIDs that are associated with a higher risk of bleeding peptic ulcers should be avoided.

Patients were excluded if they had been started on any antibiotic or other drug with a probable interaction with warfarin at the same time as corticosteroid initiation. Thirty-two patient encounters met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome assessed was the difference between pre- and post-INR values. Secondary endpoints included bleeding events, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and warfarin dose modifications. The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR values at the post-corticosteroid assessment.

Nineteen days following etonogestrel implant insertion, her international normalized ratio (INR) decreased to 1.8 and required a 55.8% warfarin dose increase (resulting dose of 60 mg weekly). Within 10 months, the patient elected to have the implant removed due to vaginal bleeding. Nine days following removal of etonogestrel, she experienced a transient INR increase to 6.5. Her INR returned to within goal range after her warfarin dose was decreased to 55.5 mg weekly.

Thirty-nine days after initiation of oral norethindrone, she elected to discontinue use due to vaginal bleeding and no longer uses hormonal contraceptive methods. No further adjustments to her warfarin dose were warranted. The increased warfarin requirement observed in this patient may have been a result of multiple factors.

There was a significant association between type of antibiotic and secondary outcomes of overanticoagulation. In older patients on stable warfarin therapy, antibiotics may lead to an increase in INR. However, this may not result in clinically significant outcomes of bleeding or hospitalization, suggesting that antibiotics may be prescribed for older adults taking warfarin as long as their INR is being routinely monitored.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23033232": "As the number of psychotropics on the market expands, the likelihood increases that a patient requiring anticoagulation with warfarin will receive concurrent treatment with a psychotropic drug. Because warfarin undergoes hepatic metabolism and is highly protein bound, it is particularly prone to drug interactions; in addition, its relatively narrow therapeutic window places patients at risk of either hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Although warfarin's interactions with other drugs have long been studied, the most recent review of the literature of warfarin's interactions with psychotropics was over a decade ago. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the literature documenting the interaction between warfarin and psychotropics, with a focus on interactions mediated through the cytochrome P450 system and protein binding. A search of the MEDLINE database was performed, and reports of warfarin interactions with psychotropics were identified. The results suggest that interactions between warfarin and psychotropic drugs are important and likely underrecognized. They also have notable implications for both safety and drug compliance. When certain psychotropics are started or discontinued in patients receiving warfarin therapy, or when warfarin is introduced to a patient receiving a stable dose of a psychotropic, clinicians should monitor a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) closely to ensure it remains within therapeutic range. Psychotropics that pose a particular risk of increasing the INR when used with warfarin include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, quetiapine, and valproic acid. Psychotropics that may significantly decrease the INR when used with warfarin include trazodone, St. John's wort, carbamazepine, and the polycyclic aromatic carbons in tobacco cigarettes; however, nicotine itself, as in nicotine replacement strategies, is not known to alter warfarin's anticoagulant effect. In certain cases, the need for anticoagulation may also necessitate switching to a different psychotropic.",

Several studies have examined the prevalence of potential DDIs among ambulatory patients in various countries. Limited recent data on the prevalence of potential DDIs in Italy are available in the medical literature. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of clinically important potential DDIs among the approximately 4 million residents of Regione Emilia-Romagna (RER), Italy, and to examine possible predictors of potential DDI exposure. A retrospective follow-up study of 2004 outpatient prescription data from RER was conducted. A previously published list of clinically important potential DDIs was refined to include only pairs of drugs in which both drugs were reimbursed by the 2004 Italian National Formulary. A potential DDI was defined as the presence of a minimum 5-day overlap in days supply for drugs in an interacting pair. The 1-year period prevalence of each potential DDI was quantified. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine patient characteristics as predictors of potential DDIs. The list of clinically important potential DDIs included 12 drug pairs that could be captured using the RER database. These 12 potential DDIs occurred 8894 times in the RER population in 2004. The most commonly identified potentially interacting medication pairs were warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6824 cases), theophylline/aminophylline and ciprofloxacin/fluvoxamine (930), and warfarin and barbiturates (567). Odds of exposure were highest among those aged 65 years or older, males, and those with more chronic conditions. Odds of exposure increased 1.39 times with each addition of a prescription medication. A substantial number of clinically important potential DDIs were identified, particularly among warfarin users. Awareness of the most prevalent potential DDIs can help practitioners prevent concomitant use of these dangerous medication combinations.",

This study sought to systematically investigate the effects of VKORC1, STX4A, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, CYP3A4, and GGCX gene polymorphisms and interacting drugs on warfarin maintenance dose. A retrospective study of 845 Chinese patients after heart valve replacement receiving long-term warfarin maintenance therapy was conducted. Thirteen polymorphisms in the six genes were genotyped, and 36 drugs that may interact with warfarin were investigated. Single-nucleotide polymorphism association analysis showed that VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP4F2 variations were highly associated with the warfarin maintenance dose. Among 36 drugs that may interact with warfarin, fluconazole, amiodarone, and omeprazole were associated with the requirement for 45.8, 16.7, and 16.7% lower median warfarin dose (all P&lt;0.05 with a false discovery rate &lt;0.05). The final pharmacogenetic equation explained 43.65% of interindividual variation of warfarin maintenance dose with age, body surface area, VKORC1 g.3588G&gt;A, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 c.1297G&gt;A, amiodarone, fluconazole, and diltiazem accounting for 1.97, 2.74, 24.12, 3.94, 1.64, 5.92, 2.47, and 0.84% of variation. The present study indicated that VKORC1, CYP4F2, and CYP2C9 genotypes and interacting drugs had a significant impact on the warfarin maintenance dose in Chinese patients with heart valve replacement and demonstrated that integrating interacting drugs can largely improve the predictability of the dose algorithm.",

Objective To identify and evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of potential DDIs with warfarin. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in a Brazilian tertiary hospital. The electronic prescriptions of the patients receiving warfarin between January 2004 and December 2010 were analyzed. Socio-demographic, clinical, and therapeutic variables were collected. Warfarin drug-drug interactions were classified as either risk A, B, C, D, or X according to the Lexi-Interact\u2122 Online database. Results A total of 3048 patients were identified who were prescribed warfarin. Of the 154,161 total drug prescriptions issued, 42,120 (27.3 %) were for warfarin. Evaluation of the prescriptions showed that 63.1 and 0.1 % of patients received concomitant drugs classified as having class D or X risk. It was found that 20,539 (48.7 %) prescriptions had at least one drug with a D or X risk. Patients were prescribed an average of 1.4 (\u00b10.4) concomitant medications with a class D or X warfarin-DDI risk, the most frequent being acetylsalicylic acid and amiodarone. Conclusion The results demonstrate a high prevalence of concomitant drug prescriptions with the potential for clinically relevant DDIs with warfarin, the most frequent being acetylsalicylic acid and amiodarone.",

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional population based register study of patients being dispensed warfarin. Warfarin doses were estimated in different age groups, in men and women, and in patients using interacting drugs. The influence of interacting drugs on the dispensed warfarin dose was analyzed using multiple regression. All 143,729 patients dispensed warfarin were analyzed. The dispensed dose of warfarin was highest in patients 30-39 years old and decreased with age. Co-medication with carbamazepine, simvastatin, paracetamol, amiodarone, fluconazole, lactulose, or bezafibrate was associated with significant changes in dispensed warfarin doses, by +40%, -3.4%, -7.3%, -8.2%, -8.8%, -9.0%, and -9.7%, respectively. After adjustment for age and gender, sulfamethoxazole was also found to significantly alter the dispensed warfarin dose (-6.1%). We provide new support for the previous scarce evidence of interactions between warfarin and carbamazepine, bezafibrate, and lactulose. Initiation or discontinuation of bezafibrate or lactulose in a patient on warfarin should warrant close clinical monitoring. The marked increased warfarin requirement associated with carbamazepine use supports moving from a more conservative reactive towards a proactive strategy including preventive warfarin dose adjustments to avoid potential adverse effects.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8792056": "Coumarin derivatives combine 3 unfavorable properties which make them prone to potentially life threatening drug-drug interactions: (i) high protein binding; (ii) cytochrome P450 dependent metabolism; and (iii) a narrow therapeutic range. An entire list of drugs which are supposed to interact with coumarins (mostly with warfarin) comprises about 250 different compounds. Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. There are several other drugs which enhance the hypoprothrombinaemic response to coumarins by various mechanisms: inhibitors of the elimination of the eutomer S-(-)-warfarin (e.g. miconazole, phenylbutazone), combined with protein binding displacement (e.g., sulfinpyrazone, phenylbutazone), synergistic hypoprothrombinaemia (e.g. cefazoline). Furthermore, bleeding complications may occur with drugs affecting platelet function [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Strong inducers of coumarin metabolism are rifampicin (rifampin) and carbamazepine. Biphasic interactions may occur where a drug first enhances the hypoprothrombinaemic response to a coumarin but has a sustained inducing effect on coumarin metabolism (e.g. phenytoin or sulfinpyrazone). The complex response of coumarins to concomitant drug therapy makes it difficult to predict the occurrence and degree of a deterioration of anticoagulant control in individual patients. For clinical practice, it seems advisable that one should monitor for changes in prothrombin time when adding or deleting any newly approved drug or any drug suspected (e.g. on the basis of this review) to cause an interaction to patients on coumarin therapy. The onset of the adverse prothrombin time response might be from between 1 to 2 days up to 3 weeks (in case of phenprocoumon) after starting a concomitant drug regimen. With amiodarone, an adverse prothrombin time response might occur up to 2 months after initiating therapy. For heparins, only a drug interaction with aspirin or nitroglycerin seems clinically relevant due to the possibility of coadministration during acute cardiac events. Both drugs are shown to enhance the activated partial thromboplastin time response to heparin.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23045839": "Oral anticoagulants are among the drugs with the greatest number of drug interactions. The concomitant use of several medications is a common practice in patients with cardiovascular problems, who often also present with depression; therefore, the probability of an interaction occurring between warfarin and the antidepressants is high, and may result in increased or decreased anticoagulant activity. Since the possible interactions between these two classes of drugs have been poorly explored in literature, with a risk to the patients who use them, we reviewed the pharmacology of warfarin and its possible interactions with antidepressants. Of the antidepressants analyzed, those that showed relevant effects on the interaction with warfarin were, in decreasing order: paroxetine, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and duloxetine.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6347619": "Drugs may interact with warfarin through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Examples of the former include alteration of the bioavailability of vitamin K by antibiotics, mineral oils or cholestyramine; oestrogens, diuretics and hypolipidaemic agents such as clofibrate may influence vitamin K-dependent clotting factor synthesis, and drugs which affect haemostasis, e.g. via platelet function, will enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Pharmacokinetic interactions are better understood. Few drugs have been shown to alter warfarin absorption, the importance of protein binding displacement has been exaggerated, and since warfarin is not eliminated to any extent unchanged by the kidney, the most important kinetic interactions are those due to inhibition or induction of its hepatic metabolism. Isomeric differences in metabolism form an important basis for stereoselective metabolic interactions, especially inhibition; this has been demonstrated with phenylbutazone, metronidazole and co-trimoxazole. Enzyme induction, although recognised for many years, may still pose problems in therapeutics, usually on withdrawal of the inducing agent.",

We report on change in anticoagulant activity with use of different topical antifungal drugs, miconazole oral gel and vaginal suppositories, and nystatin solution. We conducted a retrospective study that included 43 patients on stable anticoagulation before the introduction of topical antifungal drugs. Miconazole oral gel was prescribed for 32 patients, nystatin solution for eight patients and miconazole vaginal suppositories for three patients. Nineteen (44\u00b72%) of the patients reported bleeding complications and some of these were severe. Fifteen of 32 who used miconazole oral gel and four of 8 of those who used nystatin solution were affected. Before use of the antifungal drugs, the mean weekly warfarin dose in the nystatin group was 14\u00b75 mg, and after antifungal drugs, 9 mg, P = 0\u00b7038, while the mean international normalized ratio (INR) before antifungal drugs was 2\u00b75 (range 1\u00b79-3\u00b75) and afterwards it was 10\u00b76 (range 4\u00b75-19\u00b73), P = 0\u00b70001.

Miconazole oral gel and topically applied nystatin solution have equally strong effects on warfarin activity and can provoke major bleeding. Prospective evaluation of this effect is called for.

Evidence from the pharmacology literature, the medical literature and the 'yellow card' adverse drug reaction surveillance reports was analysed regarding possible interactions of nystatin and miconazole with warfarin. There is strong evidence to support the derangement of warfarin anticoagulation by miconazole oral gel in all areas of evidence studied. No postulated mechanism of interaction, no additional published reported cases and no supportive data from adverse drug reports were identified which would corroborate the case for a significant interaction between nystatin and warfarin. Miconazole and nystatin used as topical antifungal drugs do not interact equally strongly with warfarin. Miconazole oral gel can clearly interact with warfarin to cause derangement of anticoagulation. Nystatin appears unlikely to interact with warfarin.",

Longitudinal pharmacy claims from the pharmacy benefits manager database were reviewed to identify coprescription of warfarin and drugs associated with significant interactions with warfarin. Of the 134,833 patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, 109,998 (81.6%) were prescribed a concurrent prescription for at least one potentially interacting drug, including 87,346 (64.8%) who were prescribed one or more concomitant drugs associated with interactions known to increase the INR. Acetaminophen-containing products, prescribed for 22.7% of patients receiving concomitant prescriptions, and thyroid hormones, prescribed for 17.5%, were the most commonly prescribed concurrent drugs associated with an increased INR response. The most frequently prescribed interacting agents associated with a decreased INR response were trazodone (2.2%) and carbamazepine (1.1%). The most commonly prescribed agents independently associated with increased bleeding risk were cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Many patients receiving warfarin therapy are treated with concomitant drugs that may interact with the warfarin. The high percentage of patients taking drugs that may increase INR or bleeding risk is a reminder that bleeding events are a likely adverse outcome of combining drugs that interact with warfarin.

The manufacturers of PIs and NNRTIs were also contacted regarding unpublished data. Clinicians will gain an understanding of the antiretrovirals that are prone to alter warfarin metabolism and the implications for warfarin dose modification. Metabolic interaction between warfarin and antiretrovirals is likely, particularly if NNRTIs or PIs are included in the antiretroviral regimen.

BORSA cannot be classified as either truly methicillin-resistant or truly methicillin-susceptible strains. However, they are frequently misidentified, which poses an obvious epidemiological and therapeutic threat. BORSA strains are commonly isolated from humans and animals, and are found both in hospitals and in a community setting. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of BORSA infections seem to be similar to those for MRSA; these infections are usually more severe than those caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Treatment of severe infections caused by BORSA may be ineffective, even with larger doses of oxacillin.

Among 38 BORSA, 26 had a common PFGE profile of genomic DNA, and were multilocus sequence type (ST)25. The other isolates were genetically diverse. Complete pbp2 sequences were determined for three BORSA, corresponding to ST25, ST1 and ST47, which were selected on the basis of lacking blaZ-encoded beta-lactamase. The essential transpeptidase-domain-encoding segment of pbp2 was also sequenced from seven additional ST25 isolates. Amino acid substitutions occurred in the transpeptidase domain of all BORSA, irrespective of clonal type.

Genotyping revealed that BORSA ST1(MLST)-t2863(spa) isolates were responsible for most equine infections and were the main isolates found in colonized members of the personnel between 2005 and 2007, and that in 2007, MRSA ST398-t011-IVa(SCCmec) emerged in infection sites and personnel, replacing BORSA. Besides decreased susceptibility to oxacillin, all MRSA and BORSA of these two major clonal lineages displayed resistance to gentamicin and kanamycin conferred by the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia gene and to trimethoprim conferred by dfr(K) in MRSA and dfr(A) in BORSA. All MRSA had additional resistance to tetracycline conferred by tet(M), whereas BORSA generally also display resistance to streptomycin conferred by str. The number of hospital-acquired MRSA infections in horses could be limited after the introduction of basic hygiene measures and personnel decolonization. Two MRSA carriers could not be decolonized using mupirocin, and a year after decolonization, additional members were recolonized with MRSA. Hygiene measures should, therefore, be maintained to limit the transmission of S. aureus between personnel and horses.",

The aim of this study was to determine the production of beta-lactamases in hospital and community isolates of staphyloococus aureus, i.e. hospital associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous type of methicillin resistance, and border-line resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA). The aim of this study was also to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between mechanisms of resistance in HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA. A total 216 clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the General Hospital in the town of Cuprija and 186 ambulance Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the community were examined for the presence of methicillin-resistance using disk-diffusion test with penicillin disk (10 ij), oxacillin disk (1 microg) and cefoxitin disk (30 microg). Beta-lactamases production was detected by nitrocefin disk and beta-lactamase tablets. Determination of oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentracion (MIC) was done by agar-dilution method. The prevalence of HA-MRSA was 57.4%, and CA-MRSA was 17.7% (p &lt; 0.05). There was a higher rate of heterogeneous type of resistance among clinical MRSA isolates (11.1%) compared with ambulance ones (3.8%) (p &lt; 0.05). The rates of beta-lactamases production were similar among hospital associated isolates (97.5%), as well as in the community associated isolates (95.5%) (p &gt; 0.05). There were 4.6% of BORSA hospital isolates and 3.3% of BORSA ambulance isolates (p &gt; 0.05). The frequency of MRSA isolates in hospital was significantly higher than in community, as well as the heterogeneous type of resistance. The frequency of BORSA isolates and production of beta-lactamases were higher among hospital Staphylococcus aureus isolates, but the difference is not significant.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18819540": "The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and type of MRSA strains and antibiotic susceptibility in Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. In an analytic descriptive survey in 2005 and early 2006, patients admitted to the hospital who contracted S. aureus nosocomial infections were enrolled in the study. All isolates were identified by the conventional laboratory tests. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of oxacillin on isolated bacteria was determined by E-Test method. According to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) criteria all strains with MIC of &gt; or = 4 microg for oxacillin were identified as MRSA. Intrinsic high level resistance (mecA positive) and borderline oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) were detected by amoxicillin-clavulanate E-test strips. Strains with MIC of &gt; or = 4 microg for oxacillin and &gt; or = 8 microg for amoxicillin-clavulanate were identified as mecA positive MRSA. Other staphylococcus with MIC &gt; or = 4 microg for oxacillin and &lt; or = 4 for amoxicillin-clavulanate were identified as mecA negative MRSA (BORSA). MIC of vancomycin also was determined on isolated bacteria. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 13 and Who net version 5. Out of 134 Staphylococcus aureus samples which were isolated from nosocomial infections 90 (67.2%) were MRSA. Sixty seven out of 90 (74.5%) MRSA were mecA positive and 23 out of 90 (25.5%) were mecA negative (BORSA). Although most of the MRSA strains were isolated from surgical site infections, there were no statistically significant differences between types of Staphylococcus aureus growing from variant sites of infections. Only one (1.49) of the mecA positive MRSA had reduced susceptibility to vancomycin but all of the mecA-negative MRSA (BORSA) were sensitive to it. Because one fourth of our staphylococcus strains are mecA negative BORSA and there is no alternative for vancomycin against mecA positive MRSA and Enterococcus spp. in our hospital, vancomycin should be reserved only for life threatening infections due to these organisms. Thus MRSA typing should be done to choose appropriate antibiotic for optimal treatment of MRSA infections.",

We describe a failure of cloxacillin for a patient with endocarditis due to BORSA. The isolate also had false-negative thermonuclease and coagulase test results.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2069374": "Optimal therapeutic strategies for serious infections caused by borderline and heterotypic oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA and ORSA) strains have not been fully characterized. Recent evidence suggests that the dominant penicillin-binding protein of ORSA strains (PBP 2a) shows good affinity for ampicillin and that these strains commonly produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, we compared the in vivo efficacy of the combination of ampicillin plus sulbactam with that of vancomycin against ORSA strains. Also, the moderate resistance of BORSA strains appears to be attributable mainly to the hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we also studied the in vivo efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam against such organisms. Experimental aortic endocarditis was induced in rabbits by the following three strains: beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strain VP-986, beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain 67-0, and its beta-lactamase-negative clone. In animals with BORSA endocarditis, ampicillin plus sulbactam and oxacillin were highly effective in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities, with each being significantly better than either ampicillin alone or no therapy. In animals with endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain, ampicillin plus sulbactam was significantly better at reducing mean vegetation bacterial densities than the other regimens. For endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-negative ORSA clone, ampicillin was better than vancomycin in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities. These data show that infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strains respond therapeutically in a manner similar to that of infections caused by oxacillin-susceptible strains, with both oxacillin and ampicillin plus sulbactam being highly efficacious. Moreover, high-dose ampicillin treatment strategies were effective in the therapy of ORSA endocarditis; this efficacy is presumably related to the relatively high affinity profile of this compound (compare with that of oxacillin) for the functionally dominant ORSA PBP 2a.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10834971": "The probe-based Velogene Rapid MRSA Identification Assay (ID Biomedical Corp., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) and the latex agglutination MRSA-Screen (Denka Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan) were evaluated for their ability to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and to distinguish strains of MRSA from borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA; mecA-negative, oxacillin MICs of 2 to 8 microgram/ml). The Velogene is a 90-min assay using a chimeric probe to detect the mecA gene. MRSA-Screen is a 15-min latex agglutination test with penicillin-binding protein 2a antibody-sensitized latex particles. We compared these assays with the BBL Crystal MRSA ID System (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) and with PCR for mecA gene detection. A total of 397 clinical isolates of S. aureus were tested, consisting of 164 methicillin-susceptible strains, 197 MRSA strains, and 37 BORSA strains. All assays performed well for the identification of MRSA with sensitivities and specificities for Velogene, MRSA-Screen, and BBL Crystal MRSA ID of 98.5 and 100%, 98.5 and 100%, and 98.5 and 98%, respectively. Three MRSA strains were not correctly identified by each of the Velogene and MRSA-Screen assays, but repeat testing with a larger inoculum resolved the discrepancies. The BBL Crystal MRSA ID test misclassified four BORSA strains as MRSA. Both the Velogene and the MRSA-Screen assays are easy to perform, can accurately differentiate BORSA isolates from MRSA isolates, and provide a rapid alternative for the detection of methicillin resistance in S. aureus in clinical laboratories, especially when mecA PCR gene detection is unavailable.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2261916": "Eighty-eight Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates meeting criteria for borderline oxacillin resistance (intermediate susceptibility or resistance to oxacillin but susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid upon disk diffusion testing) were studied to determine optimal test techniques and conditions for differentiating borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Further testing revealed three distinct resistance patterns: 61 strains (69%) consistently met BORSA criteria and had average beta-lactamase levels five- to six-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible controls; 11 strains (13%) were markedly heteroresistant MRSA with delayed appearance of resistant colonies leading to spurious susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; 16 strains (18%) appeared to be oxacillin-susceptible on repetitive testing. Under conditions used to elicit intrinsic methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, a large percentage of BORSA appeared resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. This clearly shows that BORSA may be misidentified as MRSA while heteroresistant MRSA may appear to be BORSA. It is concluded that amoxicillin/clavulanic acid zone sizes should be measured after a full 24 hours of incubation, that susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus under certain environmental conditions should be interpreted with caution, and that MIC testing is the most reliable technique for differentiating these two resistance patterns in Staphylococcus aureus.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26212494": "Transcription factor forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) plays an essential role in the development of language and speech. However, the transcriptional activity of FOXP2 regulated by the post-translational modifications remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that FOXP2 is clearly defined as a SUMO target protein at the cellular levels as FOXP2 is covalently modified by both SUMO1 and SUMO3. Furthermore, SUMOylation of FOXP2 was significantly decreased by SENP2 (a specific SUMOylation protease). We further showed that FOXP2 is selectively SUMOylated in vivo on a phylogenetically conserved lysine 674 but the SUMOylation does not alter subcellular localization and stability of FOXP2. Interestingly, we observed that human etiological FOXP2 R553H mutation robustly reduces its SUMOylation potential as compared to wild-type FOXP2. In addition, the acidic residues downstream the core SUMO motif on FOXP2 are required for its full SUMOylation capacity. Finally, our functional analysis using reporter gene assays showed that SUMOylation may modulate transcriptional activity of FOXP2 in regulating downstream target genes (DISC1, SRPX2, and MiR200c). Altogether, we provide the first evidence that FOXP2 is a substrate for SUMOylation and SUMOylation of FOXP2 plays a functional role in regulating its transcriptional activity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17033973": "Mutations in FOXP2 cause developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), but only a few cases have been described. We characterize 13 patients with DVD--5 with hemizygous paternal deletions spanning the FOXP2 gene, 1 with a translocation interrupting FOXP2, and the remaining 7 with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7), who were also given a diagnosis of Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS). Of these individuals with DVD, all 12 for whom parental DNA was available showed absence of a paternal copy of FOXP2. Five other individuals with deletions of paternally inherited FOXP2 but with incomplete clinical information or phenotypes too complex to properly assess are also described. Four of the patients with DVD also meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with paternal UPD7 or with partial maternal UPD7 or deletion starting downstream of FOXP2 do not have DVD. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we show the maternally inherited FOXP2 to be comparatively underexpressed. Our results indicate that absence of paternal FOXP2 is the cause of DVD in patients with SRS with maternal UPD7. The data also point to a role for differential parent-of-origin expression of FOXP2 in human speech development.",

Deletions in the gene have been shown to result in developmental speech disorders and regulatory disruption of downstream gene targets associated with common forms of language impairments. Despite similarities in motor planning and execution between speech development and oral feeding competence, there have been no reports to date linking deletions within the FOXP2 gene to oral feeding impairments in the newborn. The patient was a nondysmorphic, appropriately and symmetrically grown male infant born at 35-wk gestational age. He had a prolonged neonatal intensive care unit stay because of persistent oral feeding incoordination requiring gastrostomy tube placement. Cardiac and neurological imagings were within normal limits. A microarray analysis found an \u223c9-kb loss within chromosome band 7q3.1 that contains exon 2 of FOXP2, demonstrating a single copy of this region instead of the normal two copies per diploid gene. This case study expands our current understanding of the role FOXP2 exerts on motor planning and coordination necessary for both oral feeding success and speech-language development. This case report has important consequences for future diagnosis and treatment for infants with FOXP2 deletions, mutations, and varying levels of gene expression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15983371": "Neurobiology of speech and language has previously been studied in the KE family, in which half of the members have severe impairment in both speech and language. The gene responsible for the phenotype was mapped to chromosome 7q31 and identified as the FOXP2 gene, coding for a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain. Because of linkage studies implicating 7q31 in autism, where language impairment is a component of the disorder, and in specific language impairment, FOXP2 has also been considered as a potential susceptibility locus for the language deficits in autism and/or specific language impairment. In this study, we characterized mice with a disruption in the murine Foxp2 gene. Disruption of both copies of the Foxp2 gene caused severe motor impairment, premature death, and an absence of ultrasonic vocalizations that are elicited when pups are removed from their mothers. Disruption of a single copy of the gene led to modest developmental delay but a significant alteration in ultrasonic vocalization in response to such separation. Learning and memory appear normal in the heterozygous animals. Cerebellar abnormalities were observed in mice with disruptions in Foxp2, with Purkinje cells particularly affected. Our findings support a role for Foxp2 in cerebellar development and in a developmental process that subsumes social communication functions in diverse organisms.",

Investigation of the neural basis of this disorder has been limited previously to neuroimaging of affected children and adults. The discovery of the gene responsible, FOXP2, offers a unique opportunity to explore the relevant neural mechanisms from a molecular perspective. In the present study, we have determined the detailed spatial and temporal expression pattern of FOXP2 mRNA in the developing brain of mouse and human. We find expression in several structures including the cortical plate, basal ganglia, thalamus, inferior olives and cerebellum. These data support a role for FOXP2 in the development of corticostriatal and olivocerebellar circuits involved in motor control. We find intriguing concordance between regions of early expression and later sites of pathology suggested by neuroimaging. Moreover, the homologous pattern of FOXP2/Foxp2 expression in human and mouse argues for a role for this gene in development of motor-related circuits throughout mammalian species. Overall, this study provides support for the hypothesis that impairments in sequencing of movement and procedural learning might be central to the FOXP2-related speech and language disorder.",

However, the role of the gene in general vocal behavior in other mammals, including mice, is unclear. Here, we track the vocal development of Foxp2 heterozygous knockout (Foxp2+/-) mice and their wildtype (WT) littermates from juvenile to adult ages, and observe severe abnormalities in the courtship song of Foxp2+/- mice. In comparison to their WT littermates, Foxp2+/- mice vocalized less, produced shorter syllable sequences, and possessed an abnormal syllable inventory. In addition, Foxp2+/- song also exhibited irregular rhythmic structure, and its development did not follow the consistent trajectories observed in WT vocalizations. These results demonstrate that the Foxp2 gene is critical for normal vocal behavior in juvenile and adult mice, and that Foxp2 mutant mice may provide a tractable model system for the study of the gene's role in general vocal motor control.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269856": " Mutations in the human FOXP2 gene cause speech and language impairments. The FOXP2 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many downstream genes, which may have important roles in nervous system development and function. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language. However, how FOXP2 gene expression is regulated is not clearly understood. The FOXP2 mRNA has an approximately 4-kb-long 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), twice as long as its protein coding region, indicating that FOXP2 can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). We identified multiple miRNAs that regulate the expression of the human FOXP2 gene using sequence analysis and in vitro cell systems. Focusing on let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p, three brain-enriched miRNAs, we show that these miRNAs regulate human FOXP2 expression in a dosage-dependent manner and target specific sequences in the FOXP2 3' UTR. We further show that these three miRNAs are expressed in the cerebellum of the human fetal brain, where FOXP2 is known to be expressed. Our results reveal novel regulatory functions of the human FOXP2 3' UTR sequence and regulatory interactions between multiple miRNAs and the human FOXP2 gene. The expression of let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p in the human fetal cerebellum is consistent with their roles in regulating FOXP2 expression during early cerebellum development. These results suggest that various genetic and environmental factors may contribute to speech and language development and related neural developmental disorders via the miRNA-FOXP2 regulatory network.",

Stuttering is a disorder in which involuntary repetition, prolongation, or cessation of the sound precludes the flow of speech. About 5% of individuals in the general population have a stuttering problem, and about 80% of the affected children recover naturally. The causal factors of stuttering remain uncertain in most cases; studies suggest that genetic factors are responsible for 70% of the variance in liability for stuttering, whereas the remaining 30% is due to environmental effects supporting a complex cause of the disorder. The use of high-resolution genome wide array comparative genomic hybridization has proven to be a powerful strategy to narrow down candidate regions for complex disorders. We report on a case with a complex set of speech and language difficulties including stuttering who presented with a 10 Mb deletion of chromosome region 7q33-35 causing the deletion of several genes and the disruption of CNTNAP2 by deleting the first three exons of the gene. CNTNAP2 is known to be involved in the cause of language and speech disorders and autism spectrum disorder and is in the same pathway as FOXP2, another important language gene, which makes it a candidate gene for causal studies speech and language disorders such as stuttering.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26282889": "Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure-outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.",

The data contain six age cohorts (ages 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18, in 1980) with the average age of 31.7, in 2001, and with the female share of 54.7. We find that taller people earn higher earnings according to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. The OLS models show that 10cm of extra height is associated with 13% higher earnings. We use Mendelian randomization, with the genetic score as an instrumental variable (IV) for height to account for potential confounders that are related to socioeconomic background, early life conditions and parental investments, which are otherwise very difficult to fully account for when using covariates in observational studies. The IV point estimate is much lower and not statistically significant, suggesting that the OLS estimation provides an upward biased estimate for the height premium. Our results show the potential value of using genetic information to gain new insights into the determinants of long-term labor market success."
