The accelerating growth in the corpus of sequencing data that underpins such analysis is making the data-download bottleneck more evident, placing substantial burdens on the research community to keep pace. As a result, the search for alternative approaches to the traditional \"download and analyze\" paradigm on local computing resources has led to a rapidly growing demand for cloud-computing solutions for genomics analysis. Here, we introduce the Genome Variant Investigation Platform (GenomeVIP), an open-source framework for performing genomics variant discovery and annotation using cloud- or local high-performance computing infrastructure. GenomeVIP orchestrates the analysis of whole-genome and exome sequence data using a set of robust and popular task-specific tools, including VarScan, GATK, Pindel, BreakDancer, Strelka, and Genome STRiP, through a web interface. GenomeVIP has been used for genomic analysis in large-data projects such as the TCGA PanCanAtlas and in other projects, such as the ICGC Pilots, CPTAC, ICGC-TCGA DREAM Challenges, and the 1000 Genomes SV Project. Here, we demonstrate GenomeVIP's ability to provide high-confidence annotated somatic, germline, and de novo variants of potential biological significance using publicly available data sets.",

The tripus fetal specimen under study embodies characteristics of three types therefore preventing it from classification into a simple variant of any one of the eight twin types described by Spencer. The aim of this study was to reveal internal structural anomalies of the fetal specimen by using magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography. Dorsally appended to the primary twin is a secondary head mass (brain tissue and ocular globe) and two spinal columns converging at T4/T5, suggesting rachipagus twinning. The ventral orientation of the secondary twin's (right lateral) lower limb suggests parapagus twinning. The caudal divergence of the spinal columns and the presence of a secondary hemipelvis, separate from the primary pelvis, suggest cephalopagus twinning. Measurements of the long bones indicate a gestational age of \u223c20-23 weeks. Secondary malformations of the primary fetal body include anencephaly, cleft palate, renal agenesis, decreased left ventricular outflow, and a prematurely terminating descending aorta.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23154370": "The separation of craniopagus conjoined twins is a very rare and complex challenge. As with many rare challenges, it presents initially as a deceptively simple problem requiring only the most basic clinical techniques. As in many reconstructive problems, this paradigm mandates that the neurosurgical team performs the separation with the plastic surgeons providing closure at the end of the separation. Historically, these approaches have included, as with the separation of many other types of conjoined twins, the use of tissue expansion before separation followed by separation surgery. In the best hands, at the most capable medical centers, the mortality reported in the literature for the past 50 years is greater than 50%. Craniofacial surgery frequently demands a coordinated effort between plastic surgery and neurosurgery and many other specializations; separating craniopagus twins takes this coordination to a stratospheric level. It is, however, this coordination that is of paramount importance. Success clearly requires an understanding of the complex interrelationship between the \"separation\" and the \"reconstruction\" and that decisions made for 1 aspect of the surgery will have a profound impact on another aspect of the surgery. The impact can be disastrous or, if planned well, can be advantageous.We were contacted to evaluate craniopagus conjoined male infant twins for separation. Radiographic studies suggested that the brains were separate, and their medical team suggested that they were \"fit for separation.\" We reviewed the literature and reviewed our colleagues' experiences with similar cases around the world. It became clear that whether separation had been unsuccessful or successful, a variety of issues accompanied surgery as follows: (1) massive intraoperative hemorrhage, (2) cerebral edema, (3) venous infarcts, (4) swelling of flaps, and (5) dehiscence of repairs with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, or brain exposure. Although the initial plan was to separate the twins in the same fashion as in previous cases (ie, single-stage separation surgery preceded by tissue expansion of the scalp), it was clear that this approach increases cerebral venous pressure during the separation component of surgery and therefore set up a cascade of events favoring failure rather than success. Wishing to favor success, we elected to design an open-ended multistaged separation to improve venous collateral circulation. We believe that this would improve venous drainage, prevent increased venous pressure, diminish cerebral edema, and favor the integrity of the dura and flap repair that would in turn lessen the risk of CSF leak. The stages would also allow the twins to recover from each stage before progressing to the next stage while continuing to receive nutritional support and physical therapy. Four major stages for 9 \u00bd months led to their successful separation. There has been no CSF leak or meningitis. To our knowledge, this technique has since been applied to 2 other sets of craniopagus with similar outcomes.A review of the pertinent literature, our rationale, and methodology are discussed in this article.",

The clinical pathology of this complex entity is reviewed and placed in perspective. A logical classification aids understanding of the anomaly, and is essential to gauge outcome from separation attempts. 'Partial forms' lack significant shared dural venous sinuses (SDVS) and 'Total forms' with SDVS also exhibit more severe compressional brain distortion. Our classification consists of Partial Angular (PA), Partial Vertical (PV), Total Angular (TA) and Total Vertical (TV, formerly O'Connell Types I-III). Total vertical has a continuous cranium, and inter-twin axial facial rotation &lt;40 degrees (Type I), 140-180 degrees (Type II) or intermediate (Type III). The term 'Angular' denotes an inter-twin longitudinal angle below 140 degrees , regardless of axial rotation. Our review categorized 64 well-delineated CPT, including 41 operative separation attempts in small children since initial success in 1952. Just over one-half were TV, almost one-third TA, and partial forms accounted for the remaining one-sixth. About 30% of CPT had shared or fused brain tissue, and a similar percentage of TA twins shared a posterior fossa. Partial forms had significantly higher birth weights, were separated at an earlier age (6 versus 11 months) and had lower mortality and better outcome compared with Total forms. A multi-staged surgical separation for Total CPT had a significantly better mortality than single-staged separation. Discussion emphasizes embryological, anatomical and clinical aspects of the malformation, with emphasis upon obstacles to a successful outcome.",

We report our experience in the management of ischiopagus and pygopagus conjoined twins. This is a retrospective review of the management of conjoined twins at Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Twenty-three pairs of symmetrical conjoined twins were managed over a 40-year period (1964-2003), of which 16 (70%) were separated. Of these cases, 6 are the focus of this study, namely 4 pairs of ischiopagus twins and 2 pairs of pygopagus twins seen between 1993 and 2003. In 2 cases, there was direct involvement of the nervous system at the site of union, with 1 pair of ischiopagi manifesting end-to-end union of their spinal cords, while a pair of pygopagi had back-to-back fusion of the conus. Another pair of ischiopagi had a fused dural sac without joined neural elements, but one of these children developed syringomyelia 2 years after separation. Neuroimaging was invaluable in detecting these abnormalities. The one pair of ischiopagi who died before separation were HIV positive and had severe brain atrophy and cystic encephalmalacia at autopsy. Nine of the 12 children (75%) had bony abnormalities of the spine remote from the area of conjunction. The most common finding was the presence of hemivertebrae, usually in the thoracic spine. Six children manifested scoliosis, which has already progressed in the oldest two. Technical aspects such as timing and sequence of separation, the division of neural tissues and reconstruction are discussed, as are the long-term complications of their spinal abnormalities. Ischiopagus and pygopagus conjoined twins manifest an interesting array of spinal abnormalities, which present challenges, not only at the time of separation, but also in their long-term management.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15278382": " Attention is drawn to the spontaneous incidence of twinning, both dizygotic and monozygotic in different mammalian species. Conjoined twinning, however, only arises when the twinning event occurs at about the primitive streak stage of development, at about 13-14 days after fertilisation in the human, and is exclusively associated with the monoamniotic monochorionic type of placentation. It is believed that the highest incidence of conjoined twinning is encountered in the human. While monozygotic twinning may be induced experimentally following exposure to a variety of agents, the mechanism of induction of spontaneous twinning in the human remains unknown. All agents that are capable of acting as a twinning stimulus are teratogenic, and probably act by interfering with the spindle apparatus. The incidence of the various types of conjoined twinning is discussed. Information from the largest study to date indicates that the spontaneous incidence is about 10.25 per million births. The most common varieties encountered were thoraco-omphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18.5%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic twins (10%) and craniopagus (6%). Of these, about 40% were stillborn, and 60% liveborn, although only about 25% of those that survived to birth lived long enough to be candidates for surgery. Conjoined twinning occurs by the incomplete splitting of the embryonic axis and, with the exception of parasitic conjoined twins, all are symmetrical and \"the same parts are always united to the same parts\". Fusion of monozygotic twins is no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning. Accounts are provided of the anatomical features of each of the commonly encountered varieties.",

Regarding the age old question of fusion or fission, it is concluded that there is no known embryologic process by which conjoined twins can be formed by fission but firm evidence to support fusion in all cases. Whether the fusion occurs between embryos on one embryonic disc or on two is of no consequence since they are all monovular. Intact ectoderm will not fuse to intact ectoderm, and all seven types of conjoined twins are explained by seven possible sites of union in the early embryo. One new term is proposed: parapagus, from the Greek para, meaning \"side,\" combined with pagus, meaning \"fixed\"; this is the group formerly called dicephalus or diprosopos. These anterolaterally united parapagus twins must result from two nearly parallel notochords in close proximity; craniopagi and pygopagi from fusion at the cranial and caudal neuropores, respectively; cephalopagi and ischiopagi from union at the pharyngeal and cloacal membranes, respectively; thoracopagi from merging of the cardiac anlage; and omphalopagi from fusion of the umbilicus or of the edges of two embryonic discs in any area not including the above sites. Parasitic twins result from embryonic death of one twin, leaving various portions of the body vascularized by the surviving autosite. The rarity of cases (2) not easily explained by the above theories, and the nearly 6% of twins with two umbilical cords arising from the placenta would seem to support these conclusions. Should one wish to learn the methods of a conjurer, he might vainly watch the latter's customary repertoire, and, so long as everything went smoothly, might never obtain a clue to the mysterious performance, baffled by the precision of the manipulations and the complexity of the apparatus; if, however, a single error were made in any part or if a single deviation from the customary method should force the manipulator along an unaccustomed path, it would give the investigator an opportunity to obtain a part or the whole of the secret.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The three dimensional architectures of the organs in each type would be explained using cross sectional figures of skull, thorax and pelvis. Although the facing twins share the internal organs without fusion, the organs in the side-by-side component are fused with modification of the situs.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28088189": " A fundamental assumption of all widely-used multiple sequence alignment techniques is that the left- and right-most positions of the input sequences are relevant to the alignment. However, the position where a sequence starts or ends can be totally arbitrary due to a number of reasons: arbitrariness in the linearisation (sequencing) of a circular molecular structure; or inconsistencies introduced into sequence databases due to different linearisation standards. These scenarios are relevant, for instance, in the process of multiple sequence alignment of mitochondrial DNA, viroid, viral or other genomes, which have a circular molecular structure. A solution for these inconsistencies would be to identify a suitable rotation (cyclic shift) for each sequence; these refined sequences may in turn lead to improved multiple sequence alignments using the preferred multiple sequence alignment program. We present MARS, a new heuristic method for improving Multiple circular sequence Alignment using Refined Sequences. MARS was implemented in the C++ programming language as a program to compute the rotations (cyclic shifts) required to best align a set of input sequences. Experimental results, using real and synthetic data, show that MARS improves the alignments, with respect to standard genetic measures and the inferred maximum-likelihood-based phylogenies, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results show, among others, that the average pairwise distance in the multiple sequence alignment of a dataset of widely-studied mitochondrial DNA sequences is reduced by around 5% when MARS is applied before a multiple sequence alignment is performed. Analysing multiple sequences simultaneously is fundamental in biological research and multiple sequence alignment has been found to be a popular method for this task. Conventional alignment techniques cannot be used effectively when the position where sequences start is arbitrary. We present here a method, which can be used in conjunction with any multiple sequence alignment program, to address this problem effectively and efficiently.",

The mechanisms of the development of tortuosity in these disorders are not fully understood, but are founded in the concept that there is abnormal, pathologic arterial lengthening in a fixed space, resulting in more tortuous vessels. Further studies suggest that patients with increased arterial tortuosity are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including aortic surgery, aortic dissection, and death. Arterial tortuosity is commonly present in genetically mediated aortic disease. Given the suboptimal performance of aortic dimension alone in predicting aortic dissection, quantification of tortuosity may augment the current algorithms for determining risk in patients with aortic disease.",

The role of GLUT10 in ATS pathogenesis remains an enigma, and the transported metabolite(s), i.e. glucose and/or dehydroascorbic acid, have not been clearly elucidated. To discern the molecular mechanisms underlying the ATS aetiology, we performed gene expression profiling and biochemical studies on skin fibroblasts. Transcriptome analyses revealed the dysregulation of several genes involved in TGF\u03b2 signalling and extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis as well as the perturbation of specific pathways that control both the cell energy balance and the oxidative stress response. Biochemical and functional studies showed a marked increase in ROS-induced lipid peroxidation sustained by altered PPAR\u03b3 function, which contributes to the redox imbalance and the compensatory antioxidant activity of ALDH1A1. ATS fibroblasts also showed activation of a non-canonical TGF\u03b2 signalling due to TGFBRI disorganization, the upregulation of TGFBRII and connective tissue growth factor, and the activation of the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin transduction pathway, which involves p125FAK, p60Src and p38 MAPK. Stable GLUT10 expression in patients' fibroblasts normalized redox homeostasis and PPAR\u03b3 activity, rescued canonical TGF\u03b2 signalling and induced partial ECM re-organization. These data add new insights into the ATS dysregulated biological pathways and definition of the pathomechanisms involved in this disorder.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25373504": " Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (ATS) is a very rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder (CTD) characterized by tortuosity and elongation of the large- and medium-sized arteries and a propensity for aneurysm formation and vascular dissection. During infancy, children frequently present the involvement of the pulmonary arteries (elongation, tortuosity, stenosis) with dyspnea and cyanosis. Other CTD signs of ATS are dysmorphisms, abdominal hernias, joint hypermobility, skeletal abnormalities, and keratoconus. ATS is typically described as a severe disease with high rate of mortality due to major cardiovascular malformations. ATS is caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, which encodes the facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). Approximately 100 ATS patients have been described, and 21 causal mutations have been identified in the SLC2A10 gene. We describe the clinical findings and molecular characterization of three new ATS families, which provide insight into the clinical phenotype of the disorder; furthermore, we expand the allelic repertoire of SLC2A10 by identifying two novel mutations. We also review the ATS patients characterized by our group and compare their clinical findings with previous data. Our data confirm that the cardiovascular prognosis in ATS is less severe than previously reported and that the first years of life are the most critical for possible life-threatening events. Molecular diagnosis is mandatory to distinguish ATS from other CTDs and to define targeted clinical follow-up and timely cardiovascular surgical or interventional treatment, when needed.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22116938": "Growth factor signaling results in dramatic phenotypic changes in cells, which require commensurate alterations in cellular metabolism. Mutations in SLC2A10/GLUT10, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family, are associated with altered transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling in patients with arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS). The objective of this work was to test whether SLC2A10/GLUT10 can serve as a link between TGF\u03b2-related transcriptional regulation and metabolism during development. In zebrafish embryos, knockdown of slc2a10 using antisense morpholino oligonucleotide injection caused a wavy notochord and cardiovascular abnormalities with a reduced heart rate and blood flow, which was coupled with an incomplete and irregular vascular patterning. This was phenocopied by treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF\u03b2 receptor (tgfbr1/alk5). Array hybridization showed that the changes at the transcriptome level caused by the two treatments were highly correlated, revealing that a reduced tgfbr1 signaling is a key feature of ATS in early zebrafish development. Interestingly, a large proportion of the genes, which were specifically dysregulated after glut10 depletion gene and not by tgfbr1 inhibition, play a major role in mitochondrial function. Consistent with these results, slc2a10 morphants showed decreased respiration and reduced TGF\u03b2 reporter gene activity. Finally, co-injection of antisense morpholinos targeting slc2a10 and smad7 (a TGF\u03b2 inhibitor) resulted in a partial rescue of smad7 morphant phenotypes, suggesting scl2a10/glut10 functions downstream of smads. Taken together, glut10 is essential for cardiovascular development by facilitating both mitochondrial respiration and TGF\u03b2 signaling.",

The biological control of this disease has become an attractive alternative to the chemical fungicides and other conventional control methods. In this review, the research trends and biological control efficiencies (BCE) of different microbial strains since 2000 are reviewed in detail, considering types of microbial genera, inoculum application methods, plant growth medium and conditions, inoculum application with amendments, and co-inoculation of different microbial strains and how those affect the BCE of Fusarium wilt. The data evaluation showed that the BCE of biocontrol agents was higher against the Fusarium wilt of cucumber compared to the Fusarium wilts of banana and tomato. Several biocontrol agents mainly Bacillus, Trichoderma, Pseudomonas, nonpathogenic Fusarium, and Penicillium strains were evaluated to control Fusarium wilt, but still this lethal disease could not be controlled completely. We have discussed different reasons of inconsistent results and recommendations for the betterment of BCE in the future. This review provides knowledge of the biotechnology of biological control of Fusarium wilt of cucumber, banana, and tomato in a nut shell that will provide researchers a beginning line to start and to organize and plan research for the future studies.",

Based on the presence or absence of these genes, four haplotypes were defined, two of which represented 96% of the surveyed isolates. These two most common effector haplotypes contained either all or none of the assayed race 3 effector genes. We hypothesized that soil isolates with all surveyed effector genes, similar to FOL MN-25, would be pathogenic toward tomato, whereas isolates lacking all effectors would be nonpathogenic. However, inoculation experiments revealed that presence of the effector genes alone was not sufficient to ensure pathogenicity on tomato. Interestingly, a nonpathogenic isolate containing the full suite of unmutated effector genes (FOS 4-4) appears to have undergone a chromosomal rearrangement yet remains vegetatively compatible with FOL MN-25. These observations confirm the highly dynamic nature of the F. oxysporum genome and support the conclusion that pathogenesis among free-living populations of F. oxysporum is a complex process. Therefore, the presence of effector genes alone may not be an accurate predictor of pathogenicity among soil isolates of F. oxysporum.",

The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however, resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with 12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other defense mechanisms. The expression of proteins of primary metabolism related to energy production, however, decreased, as did the expression of two proteins related to defense against abiotic stress. These results demonstrate the presence of important mechanisms for defense against Fol in the tomato genotype BHRS 2,3.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28683401": "Fusarium wilt is one of the most prevalent and damaging diseases of tomato. Among various toxins secreted by the Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (causal agent of Fusarium wilt of tomato), fusaric acid (FA) is suspected to be a potent pathogenicity factor in tomato wilt disease development. With this rationale the present study was carried out with physiological, biochemical and proteomic perspectives. Treatment of FA was given to the leaves of tomato directly through infiltration to show the characteristic features of Fusarium wilt of tomato. The phytotoxic effect of FA was assessed in the form of cell death in tomato leaves which was observed by increased uptake of Evans blue stain. The measurement of electrolyte leakage was used as an indicator of the extent of cell death. The influence of FA on the leaf photosynthesis of tomato plant was investigated and it was found that FA strongly reduced the photosynthetic pigment contents of tomato leaves resulting to heavy suppression of leaf photosynthesis processes, which therefore affected leaf physiology finally leading to leaf wilting and necrosis. This cell death inducer (FA) produced an enormous oxidative burst during which large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was generated in the treated leaf tissues of tomato plants which was evident from enhancement in lipid peroxidation. To assess the involvement of proteolysis in the cell death cascade induced by FA treatment, total protease activity was measured in the leaf tissues and it was found that the total protease activity increased with the treatment and leading to cell death. Furthermore, proteomic study was used as a powerful tool to understand the alterations in cellular protein expression in response to FA exposure. Differential expression in several proteins was observed in the present study. Proteomic analyses, thus, clearly indicate that proteins belonging to different functional classes are significantly affected in the plant leaf tissues after FA exposure leading to deterioration of structure and metabolism of cells. Thus, it is concluded that FA plays an important role in fungal pathogenicity by decreasing cell viability.",

The results revealed that cold distilled water extracts of O. basilicum and E. globulus were the most effective ones for inhibiting the growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Butanolic and ethanolic extracts of the tested plants inhibited the pathogen growth to a higher extent than water extracts. Butanolic extract of O. basilicum completely inhibited the growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici at concentrations 1.5 and 2.0% (v/v). Butanolic extracts (2.0%) of tested plants had a strong inhibitory effect on hydrolytic enzymes; \u03b2-glucosidase, pectin lyase and protease of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. This study has confirmed that the application of plant extracts, especially from O. basilicum for controlling F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is environmentally safe, cost effective and does not disturb ecological balance. Investigations are in progress to test the efficacy of O. basilicum extract under in vivo conditions.",

A crude algal extract had a similar effect as mancozeb at the recommended dose, both in laboratory and pot tests.

In addition, a large population of nonpathogenic F. oxysporum (NPF) inhabits various environmental niches, including the phytosphere. To obtain an insight into the origin of plant pathogenic F. oxysporum, we focused on the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its pathogenic F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL). We collected F. oxysporum from wild and transition Solanum spp. and modern cultivars of tomato in Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, Afghanistan, Italy, and Japan, evaluated the fungal isolates for pathogenicity, VCG, mating type, and distribution of SIX genes related to the pathogenicity of FOL, and constructed phylogenies based on ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer sequences. All F. oxysporum isolates sampled were genetically more diverse than FOL. They were not pathogenic to the tomato and did not carry SIX genes. Certain NPF isolates including those from wild Solanum spp. in Peru were grouped in FOL clades, whereas most of the NPF isolates were not. Our results suggested that the population of NPF isolates in FOL clades gave rise to FOL by gaining pathogenicity.",

On the other hand, Serratia marcescens strain B2, which produces cell wall-degrading enzyme chitinases, did not inhibit fungal growth and the suppressive effect of strain B2 against tomato Fusarium wilt was less than that of strain LRB3W1. Combined inoculation of strain LRB3W1 with strain B2 was more effective than treatment with strain LRB3W1 alone. When 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and the chitinolytic enzymes were applied in combination, a synergistic inhibitory effect against the pathogen was observed. It was possible that bacteria which produce cell wall-degrading enzymes enhanced the biocontrol effect of the antibiotic-producing bacterium against tomato Fusarium wilt.",

Most Six proteins are unique to F. oxysporum, but Six6 is an exception; a homolog is also present in two Colletotrichum spp. SIX6 expression was found to require living host cells and a knockout of SIX6 in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici compromised virulence, classifying it as a genuine effector. Heterologous expression of SIX6 did not affect growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves or susceptibility of Arabidopsis thaliana toward Verticillium dahliae, Pseudomonas syringae, or F. oxysporum, suggesting a specific function for F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici Six6 in the F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici- tomato pathosystem. Remarkably, Six6 was found to specifically suppress I-2-mediated cell death (I2CD) upon transient expression in N. benthamiana, whereas it did not compromise the activity of other cell-death-inducing genes. Still, this I2CD suppressing activity of Six6 does not allow the fungus to overcome I-2 resistance in tomato, suggesting that I-2-mediated resistance is independent from cell death.",

Conditions were selected under which introduction of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici caused severe foot and root rot, whereas inoculation of the seed with P. fluorescens WCS365 decreased the percentage of diseased plants from 96 to 7%. This is a much better disease control level than was observed in potting soil. Analysis of root exudate revealed that the presence of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici did not alter the total amount of organic acids, but that the amount of citric acid decreased and that of succinic acid increased compared with the nontreated control. In contrast, in the presence of the P. fluorescens biocontrol strain WCS365, the total amount of organic acid increased, mainly due to a strong increase of the amount of citric acid, whereas the amount of succinic acid decreased dramatically. Under biocontrol conditions, when both microbes are present, the content of succinic acid decreased and the level of citric acid was similar to that in the nontreated control. The amount of sugar was approximately half that of the control sample when either one of the microbes was present alone or when both were present. Analysis of the interactions between the two microbes grown together in sterile tomato root exudate showed that WCS365 inhibited multiplication of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, whereas the fungus did not affect the number of CFU of the bacterium.",

F. oxysporum formae speciales have specific host ranges but the roles of SIX proteins in diverse hosts are unknown. We identified homologs of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici SIX1, SIX4, SIX8, and SIX9 in the genome of Arabidopsis infecting isolate Fo5176. A SIX4 homolog (termed Fo5176-SIX4) differed from that of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol-SIX4) by only two amino acids, and its expression was induced during infection of Arabidopsis. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing Fo5176-SIX4 had increased disease symptoms with Fo5176. Conversely, Fo5176-SIX4 gene knock-out mutants (\u0394six4) had significantly reduced virulence on Arabidopsis, and this was associated with reduced fungal biomass and host jasmonate-mediated gene expression, the latter known to be essential for host symptom development. Full virulence was restored by complementation of \u0394six4 mutants with either Fo5176-SIX4 or Fol-SIX4. Thus, Fo5176-SIX4 contributes quantitatively to virulence on Arabidopsis whereas, in tomato, Fol-SIX4 acts in host specificity as both an avirulence protein and a suppressor of other race-specific resistances. The strong sequence conservation for SIX4 in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and Fo5176 suggests a recent common origin.",

The role of the airborne propagules in the epidemics of the disease in tomato plants was studied. In the field, airborne propagules of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici were trapped with a selective medium and their prevalence was determined. Plants grown in both covered and uncovered pots, detached from the field soil, and exposed to natural aerial inoculum developed typical symptoms (82 to 87% diseased plants). The distribution of inoculum in the growth medium in the pots also indicated the occurrence of foliage infection. In greenhouse, foliage and root inoculations were carried out with both tomato and basil and their respective pathogens. Temperature and duration of high relative humidity affected rate of colonization of tomato, but not of basil, by the respective pathogens. Disease incidence in foliage-inoculated plants reached 75 to 100%. In these plants, downward movement of the pathogens from the foliage to the crown and roots was observed. Wounding enhanced pathogen invasion and establishment in the foliage-inoculated plants. The sporulation of the two pathogens on stems, aerial dissemination, and foliage infection raise the need for foliage protection in addition to soil disinfestation, in the framework of an integrated disease management program.",

To improve our understanding of the interactions between the two Fusarium strains on tomato roots during biocontrol, the fungi were labeled using different autofluorescent proteins as markers and subsequently visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results were as follows. i) An at least 50-fold excess of Fo47over F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici was required to obtain control of TFRR. ii) When seedlings were planted in sand infested with spores of a single fungus, Fo47 hyphae attached to the root earlier than those of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. iii) Subsequent root colonization by F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici was faster and to a larger extent than that by Fo47. iv) Under disease-controlling conditions, colonization of tomato roots by the pathogenic fungus was significantly reduced. v) When the inoculum concentration of Fo47 was increased, root colonization by the pathogen was arrested at the stage of initial attachment to the root. vi) The percentage of spores of Fo47 that germinates in tomato root exudate in vitro is higher than that of the pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. Based on these results, the mechanisms by which Fo47 controls TFRR are discussed in terms of i) rate of spore germination and competition for nutrients before the two fungi reach the rhizoplane; ii) competition for initial sites of attachment, intercellular junctions, and nutrients on the tomato root surface; and iii) inducing systemic resistance.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18624637": "Saponin detoxification enzymes from pathogenic fungi are involved in the infection process of their host plants. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp lycopersici, a tomato pathogen, produces the tomatinase enzyme Tom1, which degrades alpha-tomatine to less toxic derivates. To study the role of the tom1 gene in the virulence of F. oxysporum, we performed targeted disruption and overexpression of the gene. The infection process of tomato plants inoculated with transformants constitutively producing Tom1 resulted in an increase of symptom development. By contrast, tomato plants infected with the knockout mutants showed a delay in the disease process, indicating that Tom1, although not essential for pathogenicity, is required for the full virulence of F. oxysporum. Total tomatinase activity in the disrupted strains was reduced only 25%, leading to beta(2)-tomatine as the main hydrolysis product of the saponin in vitro. In silico analysis of the F. oxysporum genome revealed the existence of four additional putative tomatinase genes with identities to tomatinases from family 3 of glycosyl hydrolases. These might be responsible for the remaining tomatinase activity in the Deltatom1 mutants. Our results indicate that detoxification of alpha-tomatine in F. oxysporum is carried out by several tomatinase activities, suggesting the importance of these enzymes during the infection process.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9237400": "The antifungal glycoalkaloid alpha-tomatine of the tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum) is proposed to protect the plant against phytopathogenic fungi. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, a vascular pathogen of tomato, produces a tomatinase enzyme which hydrolyses the glycoalkaloid into non-fungitoxic compounds. Detoxification of alpha-tomatine may be how this fungus avoids the plant glycoalkaloid barrier. As an initial step to evaluate this possibility we have studied the induction of tomatinase; (i) in fungal cultures containing extracts from leaf, stem or root of tomato plants; and (ii) in stem and root of tomato plants infected with the pathogen at different infection stages. The kinetics of tomatinase induction with leaf extract (0.6% dry weight) was similar to that observed with 20 micrograms ml-1 of alpha-tomatine. In the presence of stem extract, tomatinase activity was less than 50% of that induced with leaf extract, whereas in the presence of root extract tomatinase activity was very low. In the stem of infected tomato plants tomatinase activity was higher at the wilt stage than in previous infections stages and in root, tomatinase activity appeared with the first symptoms and was maintained until wilting. TLC analysis showed that the tomatinase induced in culture medium with plant extracts and in infected tomato plants had the same mode of action as the enzyme induced with pure alpha-tomatine, hydrolysing the glycoalkaloid into its non-fungitoxic forms, tomatidine and beta-lycotetraose. The antisera raised against purified tomatinase recognized in extracts of root and stem of infected tomato plants a protein of 50000 (45000 when proteins were deglycosylated), corresponding to the tomatinase enzyme. Therefore, it is concluded that F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici express tomatinase in vivo as a result of the infection of tomato plant.",

Two varieties of tomato (one susceptible and another resistant to infection by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) were challenged with the fungus for different periods of time, and several elements (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Ag, Cd, Pb) were determined in roots and in soil substrate. Additionally, phenolic plant products were also analyzed for the evaluation of the plant response to biotic stress. In order to obtain representative results for plants cultivated in noncontaminated environments, the infected and control plants were grown in commercial soil with natural, relatively low metal concentrations, partly associated with humic substances. Using such an experimental design, a specific role of the fungus could be observed, while possible effects of plant exposure to elevated concentrations of heavy metals were avoided. In the infected plants of two varieties, the root concentrations of several metals/metalloids were increased compared to control plants; however, the results obtained for elements and for phenolic compounds were significantly different in the two plant varieties. It is proposed that both Lycopersicum esculentum colonization by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and the increase of metal bioavailability due to fungus-assisted solubilization of soil humic substances contribute to element traffic from soil to roots in tomato plant.",

CGT nanoparticles (CGT-NP) prepared using gelatin and Poloxamer 188-grafted heparin copolymer demonstrated significant apoptotic and cytotoxic effects in C6 GBM cells. Biodistribution study in a rat GBM model demonstrated buildup of high CGT level in tumors subjected to CGT-NP+UTMD combined therapy. The tumor CGT level in these animals was increased over 3-fold, tumor retention of CGT prolonged and renal clearance significantly reduced when compared with free CGT with or without UTMD. CGT-NP+UTMD treatment was further shown to extend the median survival period from less than 20days in the control and about 30days in free CGT group to about 80days. This was achieved with low CGT dosing level (2mg/kg twice weekly). In situ monitoring of GFAP, Ki67, caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC-3 in the tumor samples together with TUNEL assay, transmission electron microscope imaging and Western blot assay all demonstrated high apoptotic and autophagy activities induced by the combined therapy. In conclusion, this study has provided extensive preclinical data supporting the use of this combined therapy to overcome the limitations of standard CGT treatment of gliomas.",

EGFR amplification and mutation is the most significant genetic signature in GBM. About half of the GBMs with EGFR amplification express a constitutively autophosphorylated variant of EGFR, known as EGFRvIII. Our in vitro data demonstrated further enhanced EGFRvIII activity and tumor cell invasion in the tumor microenvironment of hypoxia plus extracellular matrix (ECM) vitronectin, in which EGFRvIII and integrin \u03b23 tended to form complexes. The treatment with ITGB3 siRNA or the integrin antagonist cilengetide preferentially interrupted the EGFRvIII/integrin \u03b23 complex, effectively reduced tumor cell invasion and activation of downstream signaling effectors. Cilengitide is recently failed in Phase III CENTRIC trial in unselected patients with GBM. However, we found that cilengitide demonstrated efficacious tumor regression via inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis in EGFRvIII orthotopic xenografts. Bioinformatics analysis emphasized key roles of integrin \u03b23, hypoxia and vitronectin and their strong correlations with EGFRvIII expression in malignant glioma patient samples in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII/integrin \u03b23 complexes promote GBM progression and metastasis in the environment of hypoxia and vitronectin-enrichment, and cilengitide may serve as a promising therapeutics for EGFRvIII-positive GBMs.",

Thirty patients from the experimental treatment arm of the EORTC/NCIC pivotal TMZ trial served as a reference. MRIcro software was used to map location and extent of initial preoperative and recurrent tumors on MRI of both groups into the same stereotaxic space which were then analyzed using an automated tool of image analysis. Clinical and outcome data of the cilengitide-treated patients were similar to those of the EORTC/NCIC trial except for a higher proportion of patients with a methylated O(6)-methylguanyl-DNA-methyltransferase gene promoter. Analysis of recurrence pattern revealed neither a difference in the size of the recurrent tumor nor in the distance of the recurrences from the preoperative tumor location between groups. Overall frequencies of distant recurrences were 20 % in the reference group and 19 % (4/21 patients) in the cilengitide group. Compared with TMZ/RT \u2192 TMZ alone, the addition of cilengitide does not alter patterns of progression.

Endogenous expression level of NG2 was determined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Cilengitide responses of the cells were monitored to determine half maximal inhibitory concentration values. Whether the suppression of NG2 expression alters the response of A172 cells to cilengitide was examined. The effect of cilengitide on inducing apoptosis of the cells was determined by TUNEL staining. High mRNA and protein expression of NG2 was detected in A172 and U-87MG cells, while T98G, M059K and M059J cells demonstrated low levels of NG2. A172, U-87MG and positive control MG-63 were relatively sensitive to cilengitide compared to T98G, M059K and M059J. MG-63, A172 and U-87MG were unexpectedly found to be more susceptible to cilengitide. In addition, NG2 knock-down showed no significant difference in cell death between small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected and cilengitide-treated groups. The results showed that cilengitide caused detachment and subsequently initiated apoptosis. Glioma cell lines express variable levels of NG2 and differ in their responses to cilengitide. Although increased numbers of apoptotic cells were found in untransfected cells compared to siRNA-transfected cells upon exposed to cilengitide, the difference was not documented to be significant between two groups. It may be proposed that the combination therapy of NG2 suppression and cilengitide treatment showed no considerable effect on glioblastoma compared to cilengitide therapy alone. Response to therapy may be further improved by targeting other factors act in concert in this signaling pathway.",

However, when using classic variant calling software, the user usually obtains nothing more than a list of variants that pass the corresponding caller's internal filters. Any expected mutations (e.g. hotspot mutations), that have not been called by the software, need to be investigated manually. BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) provides a novel visual approach to facilitate this step of time-consuming, manual inspection of common mutation sites. BBCAnalyzer is able to visualize base counts at predefined positions or regions in any sequence alignment data that are available as BAM files. Thereby, the tool provides a straightforward solution for evaluating any list of expected mutations like hotspot mutations, or even whole regions of interest. In addition to an ordinary textual report, BBCAnalyzer reports highly customizable plots. Information on the counted number of bases, the reference bases, known mutations or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single plot. By uniting this information in a graphical way, the user may easily decide on a variant being present or not - completely independent of any internal filters or frequency thresholds.

The typical pathological feature is cast nephropathy. Presently international system staging (ISS) is used in evaluating MM. Although the classic Durie-Salmon staging system could be still used in clinical practice, it may miss out some patients with renal impairment. For evaluations of RI in MM patients with CKD, it's recommended to assess the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by creatinine based formula CKD-epidemiology collaboration (EPI) or modification of diet in renal disease(MDRD) and to stage the renal injuries according to 2013 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD guidelines. For MM patients with AKI, KDIGO AKI guidelines is recommended for evaluation. Renal biopsy is not a routine procedure in all MM patients. It's necessary for patients presenting with glomerular injuries such as albuminuria &gt; 1 g/24 h to eliminate immunoglobulin associated amyloidosis (AL) and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD). The effective treatment of MM can reduce serum light chain concentration and improve renal function. The basis of the RI treatment in MM is bortizomib-based regimen, which does not require dosage adjustment in patients with dialysis or renal insufficiency. Thalidomide and lenalidomide are two major immunomodulators in MM treatment. Thalidomide can be used effectively in RI patients without dosage adjustment while lenalidomide should be used cautiously in patients with mild or moderate RI with dosage adjustment and serum toxicity surveillance. High-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) can be therapeutical options for RI patients younger than 65 y, and they should be considered more prudently in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR&lt;30 ml/min). For patients who are not suitable for the treatment mentioned above, they can be treated with conventional chemotherapy, including VAD (vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone), MP (mephalan and prednisolone) and high-dose dexamethasone regimen. Adequate hydration (at least 3 litres of fluid intake a day or 2 L\u00b7m(-2)\u00b7d(-1)) and correcting reversible causes of RI are key points for the supportive care. Renal replacement therapy (more often hemodialysis) should be started in patients with severe AKI and end stage renal disease (ESRD). High flux or high cut-off membrane are recommended because routine hemodialysis could not remove the serum free light chain (sFLC) effectively.

One purpose is to provide a molecular anatomy of craniofacial development. To this end we have used a combination of laser capture microdissection and RNA-Seq to define the gene expression programs driving development of the murine palate. We focused on the E14.5 palate, soon after medial fusion of the two palatal shelves. The palate was divided into multiple compartments, including both medial and lateral, as well as oral and nasal, for both the anterior and posterior domains. A total of 25 RNA-Seq datasets were generated. The results provide a comprehensive view of the region specific expression of all transcription factors, growth factors and receptors. Paracrine interactions can be inferred from flanking compartment growth factor/receptor expression patterns. The results are validated primarily through very high concordance with extensive previously published gene expression data for the developing palate. In addition selected immunostain validations were carried out. In conclusion, this report provides an RNA-Seq based atlas of gene expression patterns driving palate development at microanatomic resolution. This FACEBASE resource is designed to promote discovery by the craniofacial research community.",

This is a proposed component of the Anatomical Transformation Abstraction (ATA) of the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) Ontology that was created to provide an ontological framework for capturing knowledge about human development from the zygote to postnatal life. It is designed to initially describe the structural properties of the anatomical entities that participate in human development and then enhance their description with developmental properties, such as temporal attributes and developmental processes. This approach facilitates the correlation and integration of the classical but static representation of embryology with the evolving novel concepts of developmental biology, which primarily deals with the experimental data on the mechanisms of embryogenesis and organogenesis. This is important for describing and understanding the underlying processes involved in structural malformations. In this study we focused on the development of the lips and the palate in conjunction with our work on the pathogenesis and classification of cleft lip and palate (CL/P) in the FaceBase program.

The OCDM is a project of the NIDCR-sponsored FaceBase Consortium, whose goal is to promote and enable research into the genetic and epigenetic causes of specific craniofacial abnormalities through the provision of publicly accessible, integrated craniofacial data. However, the OCDM should be usable for integrating any web-accessible craniofacial data, not just those data available through FaceBase. The OCDM is based on the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), our comprehensive ontology of canonical human adult anatomy, and includes modules to represent adult and developmental craniofacial anatomy in both human and mouse, mappings between homologous structures in human and mouse, and associated malformations. We describe these modules, as well as prototype uses of the OCDM for integrating craniofacial data. By using the terms from the OCDM to annotate data, and by combining queries over the ontology with those over annotated data, it becomes possible to create \"intelligent\" queries that can, for example, find gene expression data obtained from mouse structures that are precursors to homologous human structures involved in malformations such as cleft lip.

In this work, we focus on The Cancer Genome Atlas, a comprehensive archive of tumoral data containing the results of high-throughout experiments, mainly Next Generation Sequencing, for more than 30 cancer types. We propose TCGA2BED a software tool to search and retrieve TCGA data, and convert them in the structured BED format for their seamless use and integration. Additionally, it supports the conversion in CSV, GTF, JSON, and XML standard formats. Furthermore, TCGA2BED extends TCGA data with information extracted from other genomic databases (i.e., NCBI Entrez Gene, HGNC, UCSC, and miRBase). We also provide and maintain an automatically updated data repository with publicly available Copy Number Variation, DNA-methylation, DNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and RNA-seq (V1,V2) experimental data of TCGA converted into the BED format, and their associated clinical and biospecimen meta data in attribute-value text format. The availability of the valuable TCGA data in BED format reduces the time spent in taking advantage of them: it is possible to efficiently and effectively deal with huge amounts of cancer genomic data integratively, and to search, retrieve and extend them with additional information. The BED format facilitates the investigators allowing several knowledge discovery analyses on all tumor types in TCGA with the final aim of understanding pathological mechanisms and aiding cancer treatments.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078818": " It is now obvious that the majority of cellular transcripts do not code for proteins, and a significant subset of them are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Many lncRNAs show aberrant expression in cancer, and some of them have been linked to cell transformation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and it is unknown how the sequences of lncRNA dictate their function. Here we characterize the function of the p53-regulated human lncRNA LINC-PINT in cancer. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. A cross-species analysis identifies a highly conserved sequence element in LINC-PINT that is essential for its function. This sequence mediates a specific interaction with PRC2, necessary for the LINC-PINT-dependent repression of a pro-invasion signature of genes regulated by the transcription factor EGR1. Our findings support a conserved functional co-dependence between LINC-PINT and PRC2 and lead us to propose a new mechanism where the lncRNA regulates the availability of free PRC2 at the proximity of co-regulated genomic loci.",

We used qRT-PCR and RNA FISH analysis to evaluate Linc-pint levels in the plasma and tumor tissues of pancreatic cancer (PCa) patients. Our data demonstrate that Linc-pint expression is lower in plasma samples from PCa patients than from healthy individuals, and indicate that plasma Linc-pint levels are more sensitive than CA19-9 for detecting PCa. Our data also show that Linc-pint levels are lower in PCa tumors than in adjacent tissues, carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (CAV) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and suggest that Linc-pint could be used for distinguishing the cause of malignant obstructive jaundice. Low plasma Linc-pint levels correlate with tumor recurrence, while low tumor Linc-pint levels correlate with poor prognosis for PCa patients after pancreatectomy. These results thus indicate that low plasma Linc-pint expression could serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for early PCa detection, and that low Linc-pint levels in PCa tumors could be used for predicting patient prognosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28520978": "Mechanistic studies in erythroid cells indicate that LDB1, as part of a GATA1/TAL1/LMO2 complex, brings erythroid-expressed genes into proximity with enhancers for transcription activation. The role of co-activators in establishing this long-range interaction is poorly understood. Here we tested the contributions of the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex (PIC), mediator and cohesin to establishment of locus control region (LCR)/\u03b2-globin proximity. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the \u03b2-globin promoter to eliminate the RNA Pol II PIC by deleting the TATA-box resulted in loss of transcription, but enhancer-promoter interaction was unaffected. Additional deletion of the promoter GATA1 site eliminated LDB1 complex and mediator occupancy and resulted in loss of LCR/\u03b2-globin proximity. To separate the roles of LDB1 and mediator in LCR looping, we expressed a looping-competent but transcription-activation deficient form of LDB1 in LDB1 knock down cells: LCR/\u03b2-globin proximity was restored without mediator core occupancy. Further, Cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the \u03b2-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy. Moreover, ENCODE data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. Thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin.",

Several manipulative maneuvers have been described, although, the most effective treatment technique is yet unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the two most commonly performed maneuvers (supination-flexion and hyperpronation) in the treatment of nursemaid's elbow. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to identify randomized controlled trials comparing supination-flexion and hyperpronation. Data were extracted and pooled independently by two authors. Methodological quality assessment of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model in case of homogeneity across studies, and using a random-effect model in case of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was calculated with the \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test and inconsistency in study effects across trials was quantified by I<sup>2</sup> values. Seven randomized trials, including 701 patients (62% female), were included. A total of 350 patients were treated with the hyperpronation maneuver versus 351 patients who underwent the supination-flexion maneuver. Meta-analysis showed that hyperpronation was more effective than supination-flexion (risk ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.49; I<sup>2</sup>, 35%). The absolute risk difference between maneuvers was 26% in favor of hyperpronation, resulting in a number needed to treat of 4 patients. Trials lacked blinding of assessors and universal pain measures. Hyperpronation was more effective in terms of success rate and seems to be less painful compared to the supination-flexion maneuver in children with nursemaid's elbow.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753234": " Pulled elbow (nursemaid's elbow) is a common injury in young children. It often results from a sudden pull on the arm, usually by an adult or taller person, which pulls the radius through the annular ligament, resulting in subluxation (partial dislocation) of the radial head. It can also be caused by a fall or twist. The child experiences sudden acute pain and loss of function in the affected arm. Pulled elbow is usually treated by manual reduction of the subluxed radial head. Various manoeuvres can be applied; most commonly, supination of the forearm, often combined with flexion, and (hyper-)pronation. It is unclear which is most successful. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and last updated in 2011. To compare the effects (benefits and harms) of the different methods used to manipulate pulled elbow in young children. We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, clinical trial registers and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: September 2016. Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating manipulative interventions for pulled elbow were included. Our primary outcome was failure at the first attempt, necessitating further treatment. Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model. Overall, nine trials with 906 children (all younger than seven years old and 58% of whom were female) were included, of which five trials were newly identified in this update. Eight trials were performed in emergency departments or ambulatory care centres, and one was performed in a tertiary paediatric orthopaedic unit. Four trials were conducted in the USA, three in Turkey, one in Iran, and one in Spain. Five trials were at high risk of selection bias because allocation was not concealed and all trials were at high risk of detection bias due to the lack of assessor blinding. Eight trials compared hyperpronation with supination-flexion. We found low-quality evidence that hyperpronation resulted in less failure at first attempt than supination-flexion (9.2% versus 26.4%, risk ratio (RR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.50; 811 participants, 8 studies). Based on an illustrative risk of 268 failures at first attempt per 1000 children treated using supination-flexion, this amounted to 174 fewer failures per 1000 children treated using hyperpronation (95% CI 134 to 201 fewer). Based on risk differences data, we also estimated a number needed to treat of 6 (95% CI 5 to 8); this means that six children would need to be treated with the hyperpronation method rather than the supination-flexion method to avoid one additional failure at the first attempt.The very low-quality evidence (from four studies) for pain during or after manipulation means that it is uncertain whether there is or is not a difference between pronation and supination-flexion. There was very low-quality evidence from six studies that repeat pronation may be more effective than repeat supination-flexion for the second attempt after initial failure. The remaining outcomes were either not reported (adverse effects, recurrence) or unsuitable for pooling (ultimate failure). Ultimate failure, reported for the overall population only because of the differences in the study protocols with respect to what to do after the first attempt failed, ranged from no ultimate failures in two studies to six failures (4.1% of 148 episodes) in one study.One trial compared supination-extension versus supination-flexion. It provided very low-quality evidence (downgraded three levels for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision) of no clear difference in failure at first attempt between the two methods. There was low-quality evidence from eight small trials that the pronation method may be more effective at first attempt than the supination method for manipulating pulled elbow in young children. For other outcomes, no conclusions could be drawn either because of very low-quality evidence or the outcomes not being reported. We suggest that a high-quality randomised clinical trial comparing hyperpronation and supination-flexion is required to provide definitive evidence. We recommend that this is preceded by a survey among clinicians to establish the extent of clinical equipoise and to optimise the study design and recruitment.",

Several studies have shown that trismus affects health related quality of life. Radiotherapy in the head and neck area is identified as one of the most frequent causes of trismus in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Currently, there is no standard treatment for trismus. Several stretching techniques and jaw mobilizing devices are available, but their effect in radiotherapy-induced trismus is still largely unknown. With this review we give an overview of the present relevant literature and compare the effect of exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy on jaw mobility, expressed in millimeters mouth opening, in HNC patients with radiotherapy-induced trismus. A systematic literature search in four electronic bibliographic databases was conducted in July 2014. Selected articles were critically appraised on relevance and validity. Best available evidence was analyzed and compared. Three of the four selected articles show a significant increase (p-value&lt;0.05) in maximal interincisal opening (MIO) after exercise therapy using a jaw-mobilizing device. One article reports a significant decrease in MIO. However, this decrease is less in the intervention group, which implies a positive effect of exercise therapy.

Aim of this study was to review the etiopathogenesis, incidence, treatment and prevention of trismus in patients with head and neck cancer. Trismus is frequently seen in patients suffering from malignant tumours of the head and neck. The reported prevalence of trismus in those patients varies considerably in the literature and ranges from 0 to 100% depending on the tumour site and extension. Trismus may worsen or remain the same over time, or the symptoms may reduce, even in the absence of treatment. When a patient presents with trismus after tumour treatment, it is important to determine whether the trismus is the result of the treatment, or is the first sign of a recurrence. Restricted mouth opening may impede inspection of the oral cavity as needed for dental care, and particularly for oncologic follow-up. Mouth opening after radiotherapy (RT) decreases on average by approximately 20% compared to mouth opening prior to RT. The prevalence of trismus increases with increasing doses of RT to mastication structures. The use of intensity-modulated RT seems to lower the percentage and severity of RT-induced trismus. Treatment of trismus can be conservative (with either medical or physical therapy) or surgical. Exercise therapy is the mainstay of treatment and exercise should start as soon as possible after treatment. The prevention of trismus, rather than its treatment, is the most important objective.",

Maximal mouth opening was measured prior to and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after radiotherapy. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were analyzed as potential predictors for trismus using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. At six months after radiotherapy, 28.1% of the patients without trismus prior to radiotherapy developed trismus for the first time. At subsequent time points the incidence declined. Over a total period of 48 months after radiotherapy, the incidence of trismus was 3.6 per 10 person years at risk. Patients who had tumors located in the oral cavity, oropharynx or nasopharynx, and the salivary glands or ear, and who had a longer overall treatment time of radiotherapy, were more likely to develop trismus in the first six months after radiotherapy. Maximal mouth opening was a predictor for developing trismus at all time points. Incidence of trismus is 3.6 per 10 person years at risk. Tumor localization and overall treatment time of radiotherapy are predictors for developing trismus the first six months after radiotherapy. Maximal mouth opening is a significant predictor for developing trismus at all time points. Regular measurements of maximal mouth opening are needed to predict trismus.",

Radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment for NPC due to its relatively high radiosensitivity and deep-seated anatomical position, which is not readily accessible by surgery. Although the technique of radiotherapy in NPC has been advancing and offers promising treatment outcome, complications around the irradiation areas are inevitable and the quality of life of the post-radiotherapy patients is often compromised. Trismus, which is defined as the restricted mouth opening or jaw movement due to the disorder of temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ), is one of the possible late complications for radiotherapy of NPC and is found in 5-17% of the post-radiotherapy (post-RT) patients. Trismus at early stage may only affect the speech, but in severe cases nutritional intake and oral hygiene condition may deteriorate seriously. This article reviewed the possible causes of radiation-induced TMJ damage, the various assessments including imaging modalities and possible treatments. The conclusion is that the availability of simple, yet effective examinations for trismus is essential for delaying the progression and restoring TMJ functions. Although there is no absolutely effective treatment for trismus, many supportive, restorative and palliative management are possible under different clinical situations.",

The aim of this study was to provide an alternative operation to both eradicate oral cancer and prevent postsurgical trismus. In our retrospective cohort study of oral cancer patients who underwent operations during 2010 to 2014, the predictor variable was the type of operation (alternative operation or traditional operation) and the outcome variable was MIO. All of the cases were allocated by 2 periods: the traditional operations were performed from 2010 to 2011, and the alternative operations were performed from 2011 to 2014. All patients received marginal mandibulectomy, anterolateral thigh free flap, and adjuvant radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In addition to traditional marginal mandibulectomy, the alternative operation included ipsilateral coronoidectomy and myotomy of the temporalis muscle insertion, masseter muscle, and medial pterygoid muscle. MIO was measured at 10 time points. The adjusted variables included demographic data, diagnostic parameters, treatment, and response. Of the 36 male patients with oral cancer, 16 were placed in the alternative operation group (AOG; mean age, 53.5 \u00b1 11.9 years) and 20 were placed in the traditional operation group (TOG; mean age, 50.7 \u00b1 7.1 years). Regarding the outcome indicator of patient MIO, the preoperative MIO in the AOG was on average 7.5 mm shorter than that in the TOG (P &lt; .01), but it was consistently superior to the MIO in the TOG after the operation. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that patients in the AOG were more likely to have postoperative non-trismus. The alternative operation exhibited superior postoperative MIO values and similar postoperative complication rates. For the prevention of trismus, it is practical to perform the combined operation simultaneously, cutting all ipsilateral jaw closing muscles and the coronoid process and eradicating the tumor.",

Since IL-5 plays an important role in the maturation, survival and migration of eosinophils, hence the pathogenesis of eosinophilic asthma, biotherapeutics targeting IL-5/IL-5R\u03b1 have been developed and/or marketed, including Mepolizumab, Reslizumab, and Benralizumab. Accurate determination of bioactivity is crucial for the safety and efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. The current mode of action (MOA) based method used in the quality control and stability tests for anti-IL-5 mAbs is anti-proliferation assay, which is tedious with long duration and high variation. We describe here the development and validation of a reporter gene assay (RGA), based on an IL-5-dependent TF-1 cell line variant we established that stably expresses the luciferase reporter under the control of STAT5 response elements. After careful optimization, we demonstrate the excellent specificity, precision, accuracy and linearity of the established RGA. Our study also proves that the assay is superior on precision, sensitivity and assay simplicity to the anti-proliferation assay. The established RGA is also applicable to another anti-IL-5R\u03b1 mAb. These results show for the first time that this novel RGA, based on the IL-5-IL-5R-STAT5 pathway, can be a valuable supplement to the anti-proliferation assay and employed in the bioactivity determination of anti-IL-5/anti-IL-5R\u03b1 biotherapeutics.",

Suboptimal asthma control leads to increasing burden of healthcare costs and loss of productivity to society. Biologic therapies targeted at IgE and eosinophils can be used in poorly controlled allergic and eosinophilic asthma, respectively. The purpose of this review is to analyze the advancements in currently available biologic therapies targeted at IgE and eosinophils in asthma and to identify how these therapies may impact overall healthcare costs. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE antibody that is approved for use of poorly controlled moderate-to-severe asthma. Many studies have confirmed that omalizumab not only improves quality of life and symptom scores, but also decreases urgent care and emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Dupilumab is a biologic agent targeted at TH2 cytokines, but indirectly impacts IgE and is an important biologic agent for atopic disease. Mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab target IL-5, a key cytokine for eosinophils. For patients with poorly controlled eosinophilic asthma, these biologic agents improve asthma symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and reduce emergency visits and hospitalizations. Poorly controlled severe asthma affects a small portion of patients with asthma in the United States and yet it accounts for large portion of healthcare utilization. Biological therapies in poorly controlled severe persistent asthma have been identified to reduce healthcare utilization, including emergency visits and hospitalizations. Biologic agents have a clear beneficial role in the management of severe asthma, and further evaluations should be continued in identifying optimal patient characteristics for the various agents and overall benefit toward healthcare utilization and cost.",

Benralizumab PK was dose-proportional and adequately described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment and first-order absorption from the subcutaneous dosing site. The estimated systemic clearance and volume of distribution were typical for human IgG. Body weight and high-titer antidrug antibodies were identified as relevant covariates influencing the PK of benralizumab.

Only differences between each drug and placebo were studied. We identified all RCTs with anti-IL5 treatments for patients with asthma over the 1990-September 2015 period. RCTs were searched on Medline, Cochrane and Embase. At least 50 patients were enrolled in each study. Outcomes considered were exacerbation rate reduction, FEV<sub>1</sub> changes, ACQ-5 improvement, adverse events and serious adverse events. A global meta-analysis was first conducted followed by an indirect comparison of each IL-5-targeting drug: benralizumab, reslizumab and mepolizumab. Further eosinophilic subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also conducted in case of heterogeneity. Ten trials involving 3421 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. IL-5 blockade significantly reduced annual exacerbation rates vs. placebo by 40% [29-50] (P &lt; 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 0.61). ACQ-5 was significantly improved vs. placebo but below the recognized MCID level (-0.31 [-0.41, -0.21], P &lt; 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 0.11). FEV<sub>1</sub> changes from baseline were improved vs. placebo by 0.09 L [0.05-0.12] (P &lt; 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 0.28). The subgroup analysis identified a slight additional improvement in mean treatment effects in eosinophilic (&gt; 300 mm<sup>3</sup> /L) patients with severe asthma. Similar patterns and rates of adverse events and severe adverse events were reported with the three drugs. The data interpretations were not affected by the sensitivity analysis. IL-5 blockade appears to be a relevant treatment strategy to improve severe asthma management, particularly for eosinophilic patients. No clear superiority appeared between the drugs when appropriate doses were compared.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583618": "Asthma and COPD are prevalent chronic inflammatory airway diseases that are responsible for a large global disease burden. Both diseases are complex and heterogeneous, and they are increasingly recognized as overlapping syndromes that may share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms and treatable traits. Eosinophilic airway inflammation is considered the most influential treatable trait of chronic airway disease, and over the last decade, several monoclonal antibodies and small molecule therapies have been developed to target this trait. These include monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 or IL-5 receptor alpha (mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab), IL-13 (lebrikizumab and tralokinumab), IL-4 receptor alpha (dupilumab), IgE (omalizumab), and anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tezepelumab) and small molecule therapies such as prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> blockers (fevipiprant and timapiprant). Although these novel biologic agents have shown promising results in many patients with asthma and COPD who have eosinophilic airway inflammation, it is evident that not all patients respond equally well, despite similar clinical, functional, and inflammatory characteristics. This heterogeneity in treatment response is probably related to different molecular pathways or endotypes leading to eosinophilic airway inflammation, including adaptive immune pathways mediated by T helper 2 cells and innate immune pathways mediated by innate lymphoid cells. The relative contribution of these pathways in asthma and COPD is not yet clarified, and there are currently no reliable biomarkers that represent the various pathways. Therefore, there is an urgent need for easily measurable and reproducible biomarkers that are linked to underlying pathophysiologic disease mechanisms and can predict and monitor responses to novel biologic agents.",

The author also provides their expert opinion on this potential therapeutic and provide their perspectives for its future development. Expert opinion: Benralizumab was able to interfere significantly with disease-related morbidity and in particular with hospitalizations due to asthma exacerbation rates in a subset of patients with higher systemic eosinophil burden and higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids.

The most common adverse events for both groups were nasopharyngitis (eight [8%] patients in each group) and upper respiratory tract infections (five [5%] patients in each group). Serious adverse events occurred in two (2%) patients each in the benralizumab (pancytopenia and a suicide attempt, both considered unrelated to treatment) and placebo (cervix carcinoma and colon adenoma) groups. This study suggests that active and modifiable disease processes might be ongoing in patients with mild to moderate, persistent asthma receiving ICS.

We investigated whether benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha subunit of the interleukin-5 receptor that significantly reduces the incidence of asthma exacerbations, was also effective as an oral glucocorticoid-sparing therapy in patients relying on oral glucocorticoids to manage severe asthma associated with eosinophilia. In a 28-week randomized, controlled trial, we assessed the effects of benralizumab (at a dose of 30 mg administered subcutaneously either every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks [with the first three doses administered every 4 weeks]) versus placebo on the reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose while asthma control was maintained in adult patients with severe asthma. The primary end point was the percentage change in the oral glucocorticoid dose from baseline to week 28. Annual asthma exacerbation rates, lung function, symptoms, and safety were assessed. Of 369 patients enrolled, 220 underwent randomization and started receiving benralizumab or placebo. The two benralizumab dosing regimens significantly reduced the median final oral glucocorticoid doses from baseline by 75%, as compared with a reduction of 25% in the oral glucocorticoid doses in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). The odds of a reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose were more than 4 times as high with benralizumab as with placebo. Among the secondary outcomes, benralizumab administered every 4 weeks resulted in an annual exacerbation rate that was 55% lower than the rate with placebo (marginal rate, 0.83 vs. 1.83, P=0.003), and benralizumab administered every 8 weeks resulted in an annual exacerbation rate that was 70% lower than the rate with placebo (marginal rate, 0.54 vs. 1.83, P&lt;0.001). At 28 weeks, there was no significant effect of either benralizumab regimen on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), as compared with placebo. The effects on various measures of asthma symptoms were mixed, with some showing significant changes in favor of benralizumab and others not showing significant changes.

Because eosinophils are key effector cells in asthmatic airway inflammation, blocking IL-5, the main cytokine responsible for its survival and activation, seems to be a rational strategy. While previous monoclonal antibodies against the IL-5 ligand resulted in inconsistent improvements in asthma outcomes, benralizumab has shown promise. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-5 receptor, and has an enhanced antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity function.

Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine for eosinophil growth, differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival. Anti-IL-5-based therapies (mepolizumab and reslizumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that recognize free IL-5, benralizumab is a hmAb directed at the \u03b1 subunit of the IL-5R) target the IL-5-signaling in eosinophilic asthma.

Expert opinion: Benralizumab has the advantage over other anti-IL-5 therapies to target the IL-5R\u03b1 itself. Afucosylation enhances its interaction with its binding site and facilitates its pharmacological activity. Other benefits of benralizumab are fast (within 24 h) depletion of peripheral blood eosinophils, potent suppressive activity of bone marrow eosinophils and eosinophil precursors, tissue eosinophil apoptosis regardless of the presence of eosinophil survival factors and even at low IL-5R densities. The fact that benralizumab is dosed subcutaneously and is equally effective when given every eight weeks instead than every four weeks provides patients with convenience of self-administration and make it appealing for patients who dislike injections.",

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different doses of benralizumab in patients with eosinophilic asthma. All randomized controlled trials involving benralizumab treatment for patients with eosinophilic asthma, which were searched in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library published until January 2017, as well as the rate of asthmatic exacerbation, pulmonary functionality, asthma control, quality of life scores, and adverse events were included. Randomized-effect models were used in the meta-analysis to calculate the pooled mean difference, relative risks, and 95% confidence intervals. Five studies involving 1951 patients were identified. Compared with the placebo, benralizumab treatment demonstrated significant improvements in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores, decreased asthmatic exacerbation and Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) scores. Benralizumab treatment was also not associated with increased adverse events. These findings indicated that benralizumab can be safely used to improve FEV1, enhance patient symptom control and quality of life, and reduce the risk of exacerbations and ACQ-6 scores in patients with eosinophilic asthma. Furthermore, our meta-analysis showed that benralizumab with 30 mg (every eight weeks) dosage can improve the health-related quality of life and appear to be more effective than 30 mg (every four weeks) dosage. Overall, data indicated that the optimal dosing regimen for benralizumab was possibly 30 mg (every eight weeks).",

We conducted a phase 2a study in South Korea and Japan to evaluate the effect of benralizumab in an East Asian population. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of benralizumab in adults with uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma with 2-6 incidences of exacerbations in the past year using a medium/high dose of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting \u03b22-agonists. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The subjects (n = 106) were randomized into four groups: placebo (n = 27) or benralizumab 2 mg (n = 27), 20 mg (n = 26) and 100 mg (n = 26). Benralizumab or placebo were administered subcutaneously on weeks 0 (day 1), 4, 8, 16, 24, 32 and 40. The primary endpoint was the asthma exacerbation rate at week 52.

In these studies, patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous benralizumab 30 mg, either every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks (with first three doses given every 4 weeks), or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was annual exacerbation rate (AER) ratio versus placebo, analysed by baseline eosinophil counts (\u22650, \u2265150, \u2265300, or \u2265450 cells per \u03bcL) and by number of exacerbations (two vs three or more) during the year before enrolment. The analyses were done in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. Of 2295 patients, 756 received benralizumab every 4 weeks, 762 received benralizumab every 8 weeks, and 777 patients received placebo. AER among patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 0 cells per \u03bcL was 1\u00b716 (95% CI 1\u00b705-1\u00b728) in patients who received placebo versus 0\u00b775 (0\u00b766-0\u00b784) in patients who received benralizumab every 8 weeks (rate ratio 0\u00b764, 0\u00b755-0\u00b775; p&lt;0\u00b70001).

The extent to which exacerbation rates were reduced increased with increasing blood eosinophil thresholds and with greater exacerbation history in patients in the 4-weekly and 8-weekly benralizumab groups. Greater improvements in AER were seen with benralizumab compared with placebo for patients with a combination of high blood eosinophil thresholds and a history of more frequent exacerbations.

In a phase 2b dose-ranging study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of benralizumab, an anti-interleukin 5 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody that depletes blood and airway eosinophils, in adults with uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma. We did a randomised, controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging phase 2b study. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-75 years with uncontrolled asthma using medium-dose or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and longacting \u03b2 agonists, with two to six exacerbations in the past year. Current or former smokers were excluded. We used the ELEN index (an algorithm to predict elevated sputum eosinophils) or baseline fraction of exhaled nitric oxide to stratify patients by eosinophilic status, and with an interactive web-voice response system randomly assigned eosinophilic individuals in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, 2 mg benralizumab, 20 mg benralizumab, or 100 mg benralizumab, and non-eosinophilic individuals in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or 100 mg benralizumab. Study drugs were given as two subcutaneous injections every 4 weeks for the first three doses, then every 8 weeks, for 1 year. Patients, treating physicians, and study investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was annual exacerbation rate in eosinophilic individuals after 1 year of follow-up. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study was designed with a two-sided \u03b1 of 0\u00b72 and powered at 78% for the primary outcome in the eosinophilic population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01238861\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01238861</a>.

In eosinophilic individuals, benralizumab reduced exacerbation rates compared with placebo in the 100 mg group (0\u00b734 vs 0\u00b757, reduction 41%, 80% CI 11 to 60, p=0\u00b7096) but not in the 2 mg group (0\u00b765 vs 0\u00b757, difference -9%, 80% CI -59 to 26, p=0\u00b7781) or the 20 mg group (0\u00b737 vs 0\u00b757, reduction 36%, 80% CI 3 to 58, p=0\u00b7173). In patients with a baseline blood eosinophil cutoff of at least 300 cells per \u03bcL, exacerbation rates in the benralizumab 20 mg group (n=70) and 100 mg group (n=97) were lower than in the placebo group (n=83; 0\u00b730 vs 0\u00b768, reduction 57%, 80% CI 33 to 72, p=0\u00b7015 for 20 mg dose; 0\u00b738 vs 0\u00b768, difference 43%, 80% CI 18 to 60, p=0\u00b7049 for 100 mg dose). Our findings suggested that benralizumab 20 mg and 100 mg resided at the dose-response plateau. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 277 (72%) of 385 participants receiving any benralizumab dose compared with 143 (65%) of 221 receiving placebo. Nasopharyngitis (44 [11%] patients receiving benralizumab vs 13 [6%] patients receiving placebo) and injection site reactions (60 [16%] vs eight [4%]) occurred more frequently with benralizumab than with placebo. Benralizumab at 20 mg and 100 mg doses seemed to reduce asthma exacerbations in adults with uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma and baseline blood eosinophils of at least 300 cells per \u03bcL, possibly due to targeting of the interleukin 5 receptor rather than interleukin 5 ligand.

Benralizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody, depletes blood and sputum eosinophils. We aimed to establish whether benralizumab reduces acute exacerbations of COPD in patients with eosinophilia and COPD. We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a study between Nov 18, 2010, and July 13, 2013, at 26 sites in the UK, Poland, Germany, Canada, the USA, Denmark, and Spain. Adults aged 40-85 years, with moderate-to-severe COPD, at least one acute exacerbation of COPD, and a sputum eosinophil count of 3\u00b70% or more within the previous year, were randomly assigned (1:1) via computer-generated permuted block randomisation (block size of four), with an interactive voice or web-response system, to receive placebo or 100 mg benralizumab subcutaneously, every 4 weeks (three doses), then every 8 weeks (five doses) over 48 weeks. Study site personnel included in study assessments, participants, and data analysts, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the annualised rate of acute exacerbations of COPD at week 56, defined as the number of acute exacerbations divided by total duration of person-year follow-up. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included COPD-specific Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire self-administered standardised format (CRQ-SAS), pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and safety. We did a prespecified subgroup analysis by baseline blood eosinophil count. Analyses were by intention to treat and per-protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01227278\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01227278</a>. We randomly assigned 101 patients to receive placebo (n=50) or benralizumab (n=51), of whom 88 (87%) patients completed the study. Six patients who completed the study were excluded from the per-protocol population because of major protocol violations; the per-protocol population thus included 82 patients. Benralizumab did not reduce the annualised rate of acute exacerbations of COPD compared with placebo in the per-protocol population, with rates of 0\u00b795 (0\u00b768-1\u00b729; n=40) versus 0\u00b792 (0\u00b767-1\u00b725; n=42). Mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 change from baseline to week 56 was -0\u00b706 L (SD 0\u00b724) with placebo, and 0\u00b713 L (0\u00b741) with benralizumab (p=0\u00b7014). Numerical, albeit non-significant, improvement in acute exacerbations of COPD, SGRQ-C, CRQ-SAS, and FEV1 were greater in benralizumab-treated patients with baseline blood eosinophil concentrations of 200 cells per \u03bcL or more or 300 cells per \u03bcL or more. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between the two groups, with the most common events being respiratory disorders (31 [62%] of 50 patients given placebo vs 32 [63%] of 51 given benralizumab) and infections (28 [56%] vs 27 [53%]). A higher incidence of serious treatment-emergent adverse events were recorded in patients in the benralizumab group than in those in the placebo group (14 vs nine patients), although none of these events were considered by the investigator to be benralizumab related. Compared with placebo, benralizumab did not reduce the rate of acute exacerbations of COPD. However, the results of prespecified subgroup analysis support further investigation of benralizumab in patients with COPD and eosinophilia. MedImmune.",

Using an in vivo biotinylation tagging approach in mice, we show that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1-XPF complex interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF, the cohesin subunits SMC1A and SMC3 and with MBD2; the factors co-localize with ATRX at the promoters and control regions (ICRs) of imprinted genes during postnatal hepatic development. Loss of Ercc1 or exposure to MMC triggers the localization of CTCF to heterochromatin, the dissociation of the CTCF-cohesin complex and ATRX from promoters and ICRs, altered histone marks and the aberrant developmental expression of imprinted genes without altering DNA methylation. We propose that ERCC1-XPF cooperates with CTCF and cohesin to facilitate the developmental silencing of imprinted genes and that persistent DNA damage triggers chromatin changes that affect gene expression programs associated with NER disorders.",

Methods In a subgroup of patients from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, we prospectively assessed cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The primary end point was the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (scores range from 4 to 28, with lower scores indicating a more efficient use of strategy and planning). Secondary end points were the scores for working memory (scores range from 0 to 279, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), episodic memory (scores range from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), and psychomotor speed (scores range from 100 to 5100 msec, with faster times representing better performance). Assessments of cognitive function were performed at baseline, week 24, yearly, and at the end of the trial. The primary analysis was a noninferiority comparison of the mean change from baseline in the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function between the patients who received evolocumab and those who received placebo; the noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the standard deviation of the score in the placebo group. Results A total of 1204 patients were followed for a median of 19 months; the mean (\u00b1SD) change from baseline over time in the raw score for the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (primary end point) was -0.21\u00b12.62 in the evolocumab group and -0.29\u00b12.81 in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.85 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary end points of scores for working memory (change in raw score, -0.52 in the evolocumab group and -0.93 in the placebo group), episodic memory (change in raw score, -1.53 and -1.53, respectively), or psychomotor speed (change in raw score, 5.2 msec and 0.9 msec, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, there were no associations between LDL cholesterol levels and cognitive changes. Conclusions In a randomized trial involving patients who received either evolocumab or placebo in addition to statin therapy, no significant between-group difference in cognitive function was observed over a median of 19 months.

Retrospectively, all patients treated with volar plating of a DRF between February 2009 and June 2013 at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark were included. AO/OTA fracture type, surgeon experience (1st year, 2nd-5th year resident or consultant), type of plate (VariAx<sup>\u00ae</sup>, Acu-Loc<sup>\u00ae</sup>) and complications were extracted from the electronic medical records. Complications were categorized as carpal tunnel syndrome, other sensibility issues, tendon complications including irritation and rupture, deep infections, complex regional pain syndrome and unidentified DRUJ or scapholunar problems. Reoperations including hardware removal were also charted. 576 patients with a median age of 63 years (min: 15; max: 87) were included. 78% were female and the mean observation time was 3.2 years (min: 2.0; max: 5.4). 78% (n=451) of the patients were treated with VariAx<sup>\u00ae</sup> and 22% (n=125) with Acu-Loc<sup>\u00ae</sup>.

We identified 3983 distal radial fractures over a 7-year period. Socioeconomic status was assigned using the Carstairs score, and the population was divided into quintiles depending on deprivation. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, fracture severity, and radiographic assessment at time of injury were assessed for epidemiological differences according to social quintile. Functional outcome was assessed using grip strength, Moberg pickup test, return to normal use of the hand, and range of movement. Radiographs were assessed at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 1 year. Complications were defined as malunion, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), persistent pain, and subjective cosmetic deformity of the wrist. Socioeconomically deprived patients were significantly younger (p &lt; 0.001) and more likely to be male (p = 0.017); after adjusting for confounding factors, deprived patients were 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-4.7) years younger than the most affluent patients (p &lt; 0.001). Deprived patients were more likely to sustain their fracture by a high-energy mechanism (p = 0.004). There were no significant differences between quintiles in outcome. There was a significantly greater prevalence of CRPS in more affluent patients (p = 0.004).

Bone union, volar tilt, radial inclination, radial height, range of motion, grip strength, and any complications were assessed by a single hand surgeon. After a mean follow-up of 17 (range, 14-25) months, the mean palmar flexion was 49\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-80\u00ba), dorsiflexion was 52\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-80\u00ba), supination was 86\u00ba (range, 60\u00ba-90\u00ba), pronation was 77\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-90\u00ba), radial deviation was 16\u00ba (range, 5\u00ba-30\u00ba), and ulnar deviation was 27\u00ba (range, 10\u00ba-50\u00ba). The mean grip strength of the injured hand was 69.2% of the uninjured side. The mean time to radiological union was 3.9 (range, 2.5-6.0) months; no patient had non-union.

Most of these algorithms rely on comparing the frequency of all the distinct substrings of fixed length (k-mers) that occur in the analyzed sequences. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it.",

Mitral regurgitation was caused by annulus dilatation in all patients, by leaflet prolapse in five patients, and by chordal rupture due to endocarditis in two. Six patients underwent mitral valve replacement; three of these were operated on using preservation of the mitral valve apparatus. Three patients underwent mitral annuloplasty and chordal shortening. There was no hospital mortality, nor any valve-related complications in the series. The postoperative course was uneventful after each operation. At a mean follow up of 4.5 years, all patients were in NYHA class I or II, with improved functional capacity.

This development will change headache management fundamentally. We aim to summarize and compare the phase 2 data. The change from baseline in the number of migraine days at the end of treatment in high-frequency episodic migraine was -1 (at weeks 5-8), -1.1 (at weeks 9-12), -1.2 (at weeks 9-12) and -2.6 (at weeks 9-12) days for ALD403, AMG344, LY2951742 and TEV48125 (225 mg), respectively.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28642283": "A large body of evidence supports an important role for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine pathophysiology. This evidence gave rise to a global effort to develop a new generation of therapeutics that inhibit the interaction of CGRP with its receptor in migraineurs. Recently, a new class of such drugs, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs), were found to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine. The purpose of this study was to better understand how the CGRP-mAb fremanezumab (TEV-48125) modulates meningeal sensory pathways. To answer this question, we used single-unit recording to determine the effects of fremanezumab (30 mg/kg, IV) and its isotype control Ab on spontaneous and evoked activity in naive and cortical spreading depression (CSD)-sensitized trigeminovascular neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus of anesthetized male and female rats. The study demonstrates that, in both sexes, fremanezumab inhibited naive high-threshold (HT) neurons, but not wide-dynamic range trigeminovascular neurons, and that the inhibitory effects on the neurons were limited to their activation from the intracranial dura but not facial skin or cornea. In addition, when given sufficient time, fremanezumab prevents the activation and sensitization of HT neurons by CSD. Mechanistically, these findings suggest that HT neurons play a critical role in the initiation of the perception of headache and the development of cutaneous allodynia and central sensitization. Clinically, the findings may help to explain the therapeutic benefit of CGRP-mAb in reducing headaches of intracranial origin such as migraine with aura and why this therapeutic approach may not be effective for every migraine patient.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) are capable of preventing migraine. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. In the current study, we show that, if given enough time, a CGRP-mAb can prevent the activation and sensitization of high-threshold (central) trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression, but not their activation from the skin or cornea, suggesting a potential explanation for selectivity to migraine headache, but not other pains, and a predominantly peripheral site of action.",

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fremanezumab as an add-on preventive therapy in individuals with EM and CM who are on stable doses of preventive migraine medications. Two randomized placebo-controlled studies tested once-monthly subcutaneous injections of various dosing regimens of fremanezumab versus placebo in EM and CM. Headache information was captured daily using an electronic headache diary. For these post hoc analyses, data were pooled from patients who were on stable preventive medications and taking fremanezumab doses of 225 mg or 675/225 mg, or placebo. The sample consisted of 133 patients, (67 fremanezumab and 66 placebo). Total reduction in migraine days for the duration of the study was 12.4 for fremanezumab and 7.4 for placebo (P = .0321). There were also decreases in moderate/severe headache days (12.5 vs 7.1, P = .0058), and days using acute medication for headaches relative to placebo (11.6 vs 7.5, P = .0414).

As a new approach to migraine treatment, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) were developed to reduce the availability of CGRP, and were found effective in reducing the frequency of chronic and episodic migraine. We recently tested the effect of fremanezumab (TEV-48125), a CGRP-mAb, on the activity of second-order trigeminovascular dorsal horn neurons that receive peripheral input from the cranial dura, and found a selective inhibition of high-threshold but not wide-dynamic range class of neurons. To investigate the basis for this selective inhibitory effect, and further explore the mechanism of action of CGRP-mAbs, we tested the effect of fremanezumab on the cortical spreading depression-evoked activation of mechanosensitive primary afferent meningeal nociceptors that innervate the cranial dura, using single-unit recording in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male rats. Fremanezumab pretreatment selectively inhibited the responsiveness of A\u03b4 neurons, but not C-fiber neurons, as reflected in a decrease in the percentage of neurons that showed activation by cortical spreading depression. These findings identify A\u03b4 meningeal nociceptors as a likely site of action of fremanezumab in the prevention of headache. The selectivity in its peripheral inhibitory action may partly account for fremanezumab's selective inhibition of high-threshold, as a result of a predominant A-\u03b4 input to high-threshold neurons, but not wide dynamic-range dorsal horn neurons, and why it may not be effective in all migraine patients.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recently, we reported that humanized CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) prevent activation and sensitization of high-threshold (HT) but not wide-dynamic range trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression (CSD). In the current paper, we report that CGRP-mAbs prevent the activation of A\u03b4 but not C-type meningeal nociceptors by CSD. This is the first identification of an anti-migraine drug that appears to be selective for A\u03b4-fibers (peripherally) and HT neurons (centrally). As the main CGRP-mAb site of action appears to be situated outside the brain, we conclude that the initiation of the headache phase of migraine depends on activation of meningeal nociceptors, and that for selected patients, activation of the A\u03b4-HT pain pathway may be sufficient for the generation of headache perception.",

Two categories of cardiotoxic side effects of antineoplastic drugs have been previously proposed: Type I cardiotoxicity, defined as permanent cardiotoxicity, is usually caused by anthracyclines; Type II cardiotoxicity, considered as reversible cardiotoxicity, has been mainly related to monoclonal antibodies. The cardiotoxicity of antibodies has been associated to trastuzumab, a humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody currently in clinical use for the therapy of breast carcinomas, which induces cardiac dysfunction when used in monotherapy, or in combination with anthracyclines. Furthermore, recent retrospective studies have shown an increased incidence of heart failure and/or cardiomyopathy in patients treated with trastuzumab, that can persist many years after the conclusion of the therapy, thus suggesting that the side toxic effects are not always reversible as it was initially proposed.

The overall incidences of CHF were 0.65% (11/1690) and 0.53% (9/1690) in the 12 and 6 month arms, respectively (p&gt;0.05). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in 5.9% (100/1690) and 3.4% (58/1690) of patients in the 12 and 6 month arms, respectively (p=0.001). Recoveries were observed for the majority patients and 0.79% (27/3380) of patients experienced an unfavourable cardiac outcome. PHARE confirm that the incidence of cardiac end-points remains low and mostly reversible after trastuzumab. Identification at baseline of cardiac risk categories of patients should be of interest to provide an optimal adaptation of adjuvant modalities and a shorter duration might be an option.",

Considering the seriousness of these complications, trials are now being conducted to address cardiotoxicity associated with new drugs; however, to fully understand their toxicity profiles, longer follow-up is needed. In this review, we compile the information available about cardiac toxicity related to well-established systemic breast cancer treatments, as well as newer drugs, including antiangiogenics, mTOR inhibitors and novel anti-HER2 agents. We also describe current and next generation cardiac biomarkers and functional tests that can optimize treatment and reduce and prevent the incidence of treatment-related cardiotoxicity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905295": " Although it is known that trastuzumab causes cardiotoxicity, its extent and reversibility are still in question. Earlier studies have not evaluated consecutive patients with reproducible nuclear ventriculography. We sought to evaluate the baseline characteristics which predispose patients to increased risk of trastuzumab cardiotoxicity and to determine the natural history of the cardiotoxicity. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured in 76 women aged 36-73 years who had been treated with trastuzumab at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center. LVEF was determined at baseline and then 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Cardiotoxicity was defined as \u2265 16% decrease in LVEF or \u2265 10% decrease in LVEF to &lt;50%. There were no differences in comorbidities, earlier treatment, or demographics between patients with and without trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy except that African Americans were more likely to develop decreased LVEF (P &lt; .05). Twenty-one patients (28%) met criteria for cardiotoxicity. Four of those patients were continued on trastuzumab and 17 patients had therapy withheld at some point. Only 1 patient developed symptomatic heart failure requiring inpatient hospitalization. LVEF improved in most patients regardless of whether or not trastuzumab was continued. Decreased LVEF while undergoing trastuzumab therapy occurs frequently and is usually reversible. African Americans had a higher risk of developing decreased LVEF. These findings raise clinically important questions as to whether it is necessary to discontinue trastuzumab for asymptomatic decrease in LVEF and whether African Americans are more predisposed to a decrease in LVEF while receiving trastuzumab. Further studies carefully assessing LVEF should address these hypotheses.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23414468": "Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity may induce reversible damage that is usually transitory and improves with trastuzumab withdrawal. In clinical trials with trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting patients with cardiac risks were not included. Subgroup analysis identified subpopulations that were most likely to experience cardiac damage upon trastuzumab exposure. Although there is a risk of cardiac toxicity with adjuvant trastuzumab, the improvement of outcome in patients treated with this drug outweighs this. It is essential, therefore, to properly assess cardiac function prior to, during and after trastuzumab therapy in all patients. The incidence of congestive heart failure in older patients treated with trastuzumab is expected to be higher than in the overall population evaluated in large clinical trials. Therefore, cardiac risk assessment, breast cancer recurrence risk, and discussion between cardiologists and oncologists should take place prior to deciding which adjuvant treatment is appropriate for a woman with early breast cancer. A longer follow-up period is recommended in order to verify whether cardiac reversibility remains and, accordingly, whether the short-term risk is exaggerated or understated. With the NSABP-B31 trial regimen, the benefit of trastuzumab definitely outweighs the risk; indeed, the occurrence of late congestive heart failure after adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy is fairly unusual. In the era of personalized medicine, efforts are needed to promote strategies for risk detection and management to avoid dangerous toxicities that may impede the development of and patient access to new agents.",

This agent has shown a highly significant antitumour effect for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, and is now considered part of the standard regimens for the treatment of this disease in both the metastatic and adjuvant setting. Cardiotoxicity has been associated with trastuzumab, and this issue has now been studied and documented in a number of adjuvant trials for which data have now been released. Cardiotoxicity has been shown to be potentiated when the agent is used concurrently or sequentially with an anthracycline, and this has limited the use of trastuzumab in some patients. Determining the overall impact of trastuzumab is further complicated by the administration of other cardiotoxic agents such as the taxanes and cyclophosphamide as well as by pre-existing cardiac disease. The incidence of severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV) was 0-3.9% in the trastuzumab arms versus 0-1.3% in the control arms in the five major randomized adjuvant trials. Only one cardiac death was related to trastuzumab whereas two cardiac deaths occurred in the control arms. Ejection fraction decline of &gt;or=10% or 15% was reported in 3-34% of trastuzumab recipients in these trials. Patients affected by trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity do not exhibit the cellular death and distinctive ultrastructural myocardial changes seen on electron microscopy with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab also differs from traditional chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in that it appears to be at least partially reversible, not related to the cumulative dose, and re-challenge is generally tolerated. There remain a number of uncertainties regarding the diagnosis and management of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. While no formal guidelines or consensus statements exist at present regarding cardiac monitoring during use of trastuzumab, proposed recommendations include a careful assessment of ejection fraction prior to initiating trastuzumab, avoidance of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with anthracyclines, and regular monitoring of symptoms and cardiac function during and for several years after therapy. Increased vigilance is appropriate for higher risk patients.",

Safety data collected from pivotal trials with trastuzumab indicate that this therapy is generally well tolerated. However trials of the combination of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, and in particular chemotherapy with anthracyclines, have revealed an elevated incidence of cardiotoxicity in some patients, which was not apparent in preclinical or early clinical studies. Analyses of the available data suggest that in most cases the cardiotoxicity observed may reflect an exacerbation of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. The biological mechanism of the cardiotoxicity has been investigated in several studies, and current data indicate that the heregulin/HER2-signalling pathway may have an important role. It is of note that the cardiotoxicity is generally reversible and can usually be managed with standard medical treatment. Improvement in cardiac function is seen both in patients who continue trastuzumab and in those in whom further therapy is withdrawn, indicating that with careful management anticancer therapy can be continued.",

However, a small but not insignificant proportion of patients have experienced trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity during these trials. This phenomenon is generally characterized by an asymptomatic reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or, less often, congestive heart failure (CHF). Concomitant anthracycline therapy significantly increases the risk for cardiotoxicity during trastuzumab treatment, and such regimens are therefore not recommended. The cardiac dysfunction associated with trastuzumab is most often reversible upon discontinuation of treatment and initiation of standard medical therapy for CHF. Prior to treatment initiation, a risk-benefit analysis should be performed for each individual patient, including a thorough assessment of potential risk factors and cardiac function. Cardiac monitoring should be continued throughout trastuzumab therapy and the follow-up period, because early recognition of trastuzumab-associated cardiac dysfunction can allow effective medical intervention. Following the occurrence of asymptomatic LVEF reduction or CHF and appropriate medical intervention, reintroduction of trastuzumab may be considered in patients following resolution of normal cardiac function, or in those for whom the benefit of antitumor therapy outweighs the risk for CHF.",

This article provides an overview of the available cardiac safety data from the major trastuzumab clinical trials in breast cancer, highlighting areas of ongoing controversy.

At the 7th cycle of trastuzumab, she had symptoms of heart failure with left ventricle ejection fraction = 59%. Trastuzumab dosage was reduced in 25%, and heart function progressively improved. Two years after her discharge, the patient remains asymptomatic. Systolic function of the left ventricle was normal before the initial dosis of trastuzumab, but significantly worsened following the beginning of drug administration. Moreover, a clear improvement of heart function was observed soon after the daily dose of trastuzumab was reduced.

However, trastuzumab is associated with cardiotoxicity that has not yet been fully explored. We present our experience with patients who developed trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Over a 4-year period, 38 patients with HER2/neu-positive breast cancer were referred for suspected trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. All patients had previously received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Results After doxorubicin but before trastuzumab, the mean (+/- standard deviation) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.61 +/- 0.13, and the LVEF decreased to 0.43 +/- 0.16 after trastuzumab (P &lt; .0001). After withdrawal of trastuzumab, the LVEF increased to 0.56 +/- 0.11. Mean time to recovery of LVEF was 1.5 months and was temporally associated with medical treatment in 32 (84%) of the 38 patients but occurred without treatment in six patients (16%). Increases in LVEF were noted in 37 of the 38 patients. Twenty-five of these patients were re-treated with trastuzumab; three patients had recurrent left ventricular dysfunction, but 22 patients (88%) did not. All re-treatment patients continued on their therapeutic regimen for heart failure when rechallenged with trastuzumab. Nine patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy. Ultrastructural changes were not seen. Patients who develop cardiotoxicity while receiving trastuzumab therapy generally improve on removal of the agent. The mechanism of trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction is different from that of anthracycline cardiotoxicity, in part, demonstrated by the absence of anthracycline-like ultrastructural changes. Reintroducing trastuzumab may be appropriate for some individuals who previously have experienced trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction.",

This paper reviews the cardiotoxicity, associated with trastuzumab use and discusses the risk assessment and management of cardiac dysfunction. The increased risk of cardiotoxicity is lower when trastuzumab is given as monotherapy (3%-7%) compared with anthracyclines + trastuzumab therapy (27%). Type II cardiac changes occur in trastuzumab-treated patients, which do not appear to be dose-related, are not associated with histological changes, and are generally reversible. Several risk factors for cardiac events have been identified and assessing levels of troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain B-type natriuretic peptide before and after treatment with trastuzumab may allow early detection of cardiotoxicity. A symptomatic and functional evaluation scheme for patients indicated for treatment with trastuzumab has also been proposed to work alongside therapeutic options for the treatment of heart failure. The risk of cardiac dysfunction associated with trastuzumab can be justified given the increase in overall survival. This risk is lower when trastuzumab is given as monotherapy. The paradigm for cardiologists remains the same: treat the cancer effectively whilst preventing cardiotoxicity.",

The BSG 98 pre-irradiation chemotherapy protocol showed a significant increase in overall survival. In contrast to current treatment strategies, patients did not have to undergo surgical stereotactic biopsy, which can sometimes lead to complications, to be included in this protocol. We retrospectively reviewed all the cases of DIPG that were treated in our department from September 15, 2004 to September 15, 2014. We compared the group of patients who followed our BSG 98 protocol to those who were treated with new targeted therapy protocols where systematic biopsy was required. Patients in the BSG 98 protocol were treated with BCNU, cisplatin, and methotrexate, followed by radiation at disease progression. Targeted therapy protocols included radiation therapy along with treatment by erlotinib, cilengitide, or an association of nimotuzumab and vinblastine. Sixteen patients were treated with the BSG 98 protocol, and 9 patients were treated with new targeted therapy protocols. Median overall survival was significantly higher in the BSG 98 group compared to the targeted therapy group (16.1 months (95 % CI, 10.4-19.0) vs 8.8 months (95 % CI 1.4-12.3); p = 0.0003). An increase in the median progression-free survival was observed (respectively, 8.6 vs 3.0 months; p = 0.113). The present study confirms that the BSG 98 protocol is one of the most effective current treatment strategies for DIPG.

We found that nimotuzumab with or without radiotherapy, chemotherapy in newly diagnosed or recurrent HGG, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), might improve the response rate or the survival time. In conclusion, nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug with acceptable toxicity, and it may have promising value in the combination treatment.

Analogous to simultaneous radiochemotherapy in non-metastatic HGG and DIPG, concurrent craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and metronomic temozolomide (metroTMZ) may represent a reasonable therapeutic approach. However, the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of this treatment still have to be investigated. Between March 2007 and December 2012, six children with primary metastatic HGG (n = 4) or DIPG (n = 2) received CSI and concurrent metroTMZ based on individual treatment recommendations and, in some cases, within the HIT-HGG 2007 multicenter trial. Outcome and treatment-related toxicities were evaluated. All patients received irradiation to the entire craniospinal axis (35.2 Gy, n = 5; 36 Gy, n = 1:) and 5 received a local boost to macroscopic tumor deposits. Simultaneously, metroTMZ (75 mg/m(2)/day, n = 5; 60 mg/m(2)/day, n = 1) was administered. Additionally, 1 patient received nimotuzumab once per week. Within a median follow-up of 10.0 months (range 6.5-18.7 months), all patients experienced disease progression and 5 patients died.

Acute myelosuppression most severely limited application of this aggressive treatment strategy. Severe hematotoxicities (\u2265 grade 3) occurred in all patients and metroTMZ had to be interrupted or discontinued in 4 out of 6 cases. Concurrent CSI and metroTMZ might represent a feasible treatment approach for primary metastatic HGG and DIPG.

Findings on the role of EGFR signaling in the onset of childhood DIPG prompted the use of nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. Assuming a potential synergy with both radiotherapy and vinorelbine, a pilot phase 2 protocol was launched that combined nimotuzumab with concomitant radiation and vinorelbine. An amendment in July 2011 introduced re-irradiation at relapse. The primary endpoint for first-line treatment was objective response rate (CR + PR + SD) according to the RECIST. This report concerns the outcome of this strategy as a whole. Vinorelbine 20 mg/m(2) was administered weekly, with nimotuzumab 150 mg/m(2) in the first 12 weeks of treatment; radiotherapy was delivered from weeks 3 to 9, for a total dose of 54 Gy.

Upcoming genomic results of the different tumour entities may suggest certain combination partners of the antibody. Recent studies of nimotuzumab indicate the reason for the lack of toxicity, which is the most attractive argument for its clinical use besides modest efficacy.

There are crucial molecular differences between adult and pediatric HGG such that results from adult clinical trials cannot simply be extrapolated to children. Molecular markers overexpressed in pediatric HGG include PDGFR\u03b1 and P53. Amplification of EGFR is observed, but to a lesser degree than in adult HGG. Potential molecular targets and new therapies in development for pediatric HGG are described in this review. Research into bevacizumab in pediatric HGG indicates that its activity is less than that observed in adult HGG. Similarly, tipifarnib was found to have minimal activity in pediatric HGG, whereas gefitinib has shown greater effects. After promising phase I findings in children with primary CNS tumors, the integrin inhibitor cilengitide is being investigated in a phase II trial in pediatric HGG.

Treatment has historically included bracing, physeal stapling, or corrective osteotomy, and was determined primarily by age at presentation. As we feel the pathology is not necessarily age dependent, we have elected to use the technique of guided growth using a lateral tension band plate to correct limb alignment as a first-line treatment in all patients presenting to our clinic as long as they had growth remaining and no evidence of a physeal bar.We identified 17 patients with tibia vara (27 limbs) who were managed by means of guided growth of the proximal tibia, from age 1.8 years to 15.1 years. Clinical and radiographic parameters were followed pre- and postoperatively. The response to guided growth was documented as were any related complications.Twenty-one (78%) limbs had complete normalization of their mechanical axis (middle 50% of knee). Time to correction averaged 13.5 months (8-19 months). There were no peri-operative complications. We observed hardware failure in 3 patients; 2 with screw breakage and 1 patient with hardware migration, none requiring subsequent osteotomy or further treatment. Two patients had rebound varus: one is being observed and another has undergone a repeat procedure.Patients with pathologic tibia vara present at various ages and have historically undergone various treatments ranging from bracing to tibial osteotomy based on age at presentation. We have found that guided growth utilizing tethering plates can be used effectively as first-line treatment in all patients with growth remaining. This minimally invasive method is predictable and well tolerated. Recurrent deformity, though unlikely, is easily remedied by repeating the process and does not preclude osteotomy if eventually needed.

This study aims to describe using femur, tibia and fibula osteotomies to treat infantile Blount's disease. From May 1992 to May 2005, 7 patients of Blount's disease (3 males, 4 females) were included, whose age was range from 17 to 62 months. Femorotibial angle (FTA) was 31 \u00b1 6\u00b0 (range from 27\u00b0 to 41\u00b0). Metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle (MDA) was 16 \u00b1 4\u00b0 (range from 13\u00b0 to 24\u00b0). The femoral vara angle was 10 \u00b1 4\u00b0 (range from 2\u00b0 to 23\u00b0). According to Langenskiold's classification, 3 patients were in stage II, 7 patients in stage III, and 2 patients in stage IV. Five cases were affected bilateral and 2 unilaterally, treated by famur, tibia and fibula valgus osteotomies, and a hip spica cast were used for 6 weeks after operation. Results indicated that all patients were followed up 3 to 16 years. FTA, MDA and femur diaphysis were measured, FTA was 2 \u00b1 7\u00b0valgus (from 4\u00b0 vara to 13\u00b0 valgus). MDA was 1 \u00b1 2\u00b0valgus (range from 0\u00b0 to 12\u00b0). Femoral diaphyseal angle was 1 \u00b1 3\u00b0valgus (range from 3\u00b0 vara to 7\u00b0 valgus). Six patients could walk without any knee pain, except for 1 patient with bilateral disorder feels his left genu uncomfortable after long time stand or work. His MDA was 12\u00b0, and FAT was -4\u00b0. In conclusion, femur, tibia and fibula osteotomies are useful for correction of Blount's disease.

The surgical treatments involved in correction of Blount's disease are often technically demanding, complicated procedures. These procedures can lead to prolonged recovery times and poor patient compliance. In such a context we are suggesting \"fibulectomy with Z osteotomy\" of the proximal tibia, a relatively simple and highly effective technique. This technique is based on correcting the mechanical axis of the lower limb thereby restoring growth from the medial physis of proximal tibia. We have used a new surgical technique, which includes fibulectomy followed by a Z-shaped osteotomy. We have used this simple technique in a 5 year-old boy with unilateral Blount's disease. The femoro-tibial angle was corrected from 18.2\u00b0 of varus to 4.2\u00b0 of valgus. The angular correction obtained after operation was 22\u00b0. There were no postoperative complications.

Each of these treatment options has its disadvantages. Treating the coronal deformity alone (genu varum) will result in persistence of the internal tibial torsion (the axial deformity). In this report, we describe the combination of lateral growth modulation and distal tibial external rotation osteotomy to correct all the elements of the disease. This has not been described before for treatment of Blount's disease. Both coronal and axial deformities were corrected in this patient. We propose this combination (rather than the lateral growth modulation alone) as the method of treatment for early stages of Blount's disease as it corrects both elements of the disease and in the same time avoids the complications of proximal tibial osteotomy.",

Changes in the loading of knee structures such as tibial articular cartilage, menisci and subcondral bone are well documented in case of genu varum. But the mechanical effects of this condition on foot bones are still questionable. In this study, the authors hypothesized that stress distributions on foot bones might increase in patients with tibia vara when compared with patients who had normal lower extremity mechanical axis. Three-dimensional (3D) finite element analyses of human lower limb were used to investigate and compare the loading on foot bones in normal population and patient with tibia vara. The segmentation software, MIMICS was used to generate the 3D images of the bony structures of normal and varus malalignment lower extremity. Except the spaces between the adjacent surface of the phalanges fused, metatarsals, cuneiforms, cuboid, navicular, talus and calcaneus bones were independently developed to form foot and ankle complex. Also femur, tibia and fibula were modeled utilizing mechanical axis. ANSYS version 14 was used for mechanical tests and maximum equivalent stresses (MES) were examined. As a result of the loading conditions, in varus model MES on talus, calcaneus and cuboid were found higher than in normal model.

In an attempt to improve the post-operative outcomes and reduce known neurologic complications, we used discrete multimodality recording and stimulation models to identify areas of motor and sensory function in eighteen (18) pediatric patients presenting with Tibia Vara (Blount's Disease). By using both posterior tibial and peroneal nerves somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) with transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (TCeMEPs) precise status of sensory and motor pathways was possible during surgical correction. Similarly, spontaneous electromyography (s-EMG) and triggered electromyography (t-EMG) were used to more accurately localize nerve irritation. Concerns during tibial and fibular osteotomies included ipsilateral lower limb motor and sensory function, especially peroneal nerve injuries due to the location of the osteotomy at the fibular neck. Surgical interventions consisting of additional fibular resection were made during the index procedures for four patients because of real-time monitoring changes noted as the peroneal nerve was entrapped in three patients at the osteotomy site. In fourth patient, the tourniquet pressure was the cause for loss of ipsilateral SSEPs and TCeMEPs. After appropriate surgical intervention, monitoring parameters began to normalize and postoperatively the patients presented with no neurologic deficit. In this study, the application of multimodality recording and stimulation models were utilized including posterior tibial nerve and peroneal nerve SSEP with lumbar potential (LP) identification to compare with contralateral limb recordings.

Treatment remains controversial. Many studies in the past have shown that an osteotomy with acute correction is the most appropriate treatment. More recently however, there has been a growing interest, especially in severe cases, in using gradual correction with the Ilizarov technique after a single high tibial osteotomy. A retrospective study in 20 children with late-onset tibia vara, who were treated by gradual angulation translation high tibial osteotomy using the Ilizarov technique, was performed. The mean follow-up period was 2.9 years (range: 2-4 years; SD 0.75). Recurrence of varus deformity to various degrees was noted in 10 of 22 cases (45.5%). Recurrence of deformity was found to be significantly related to both the degree of pre-operative deviation and the duration of follow-up. No statistically significant relationship was found between recurrence and the age of the patients at the time of the operation. Angulation translation high tibial osteotomy using the Ilizarov technique is a unique method for realignment of the mechanical axis in late onset tibia vara. It also allows for correction of associated deformities. The rate of recurrence of varus deformity is however relatively high.",

The Multi-Axial Correction (MAC) monolateral external fixation system (Biomet, Parsippany, NJ, USA) is a non-circular fixator that was developed as a response to the technical difficulty for both patients and physicians of placing, managing, and tolerating a circular fixator. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of the MAC system for the treatment of pediatric patients with Blount's disease. A retrospective analysis of 17 consecutive patients with surgically corrected Blount's disease using the MAC system with tibial and fibular osteotomies was identified. Patient charts and radiographs at three different time points (pre-operative, fixator removal, and final follow-up) were reviewed. The mechanical axis deviation (MAD), tibial-femoral angle (TFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and posterior proximal tibial angle (PPTA) were measured in the MAC group at the three time points mentioned previously. The total wear time, total operative time, and post-operative complications were noted. The MAC system was able to correct the deformity of Blount's disease as measured by a decrease in the MAD (40.2 +/- 29.3 mm; P &lt;/= 0.001) and TFA (15.9 +/- 13.7 degrees ; P &lt;/= 0.001), as well as an increase in the MPTA (15.7 +/- 14.6 degrees ; P = 0.001) at the time of fixator removal. The correction was maintained for these parameters at the time of final follow-up (P &lt;/= 0.025). The absolute values obtained at final follow-up for MAD (20.5 +/- 12.7 mm medial), TFA (8.0 +/- 4.1 degrees varus), and MPTA (83.7 +/- 8.1 degrees ) after correction with the MAC system were close to what is considered as normal for these indices. The most common complications noted were superficial pin tract infections and/or cellulitis, with no patients having nerve palsy, compartment syndrome, non-union, or leg length discrepancies. The total time that the fixator was on the patients prior to removal was 130.6 days (standard deviation [SD] = 44.8). The mean operative time was 120.6 min (SD = 21.2). Correction of Blount's disease with osteotomy of the tibia and fibula as well as dynamic fixation with the MAC system achieved deformity correction as measured by radiographic indices with minimal intra- and post-operative complications.

This approach has also been explored in several other genetic disorders, including laminin \u03b12 chain-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy (e.g., Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B), sarcoglycanopathy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C), and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. Antisense-mediated exon skipping is also a powerful tool to examine the function of genes and exons. A significant challenge in exon skipping is how to design effective AONs. The mechanism of mRNA splicing is highly complex with many factors involved. The selection of target sites, the length of AONs, the AON chemistry, and the melting temperature versus the RNA strand play important roles.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, phase 3 efficacy and safety trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. The primary end points were a motor-milestone response (defined according to results on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination) and event-free survival (time to death or the use of permanent assisted ventilation). Secondary end points included overall survival and subgroup analyses of event-free survival according to disease duration at screening. Only the first primary end point was tested in a prespecified interim analysis. To control the overall type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical testing strategy was used for the second primary end point and the secondary end points in the final analysis. In the interim analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the nusinersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (21 of 51 infants [41%] vs. 0 of 27 [0%], P&lt;0.001), and this result prompted early termination of the trial. In the final analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the nusinersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (37 of 73 infants [51%] vs. 0 of 37 [0%]), and the likelihood of event-free survival was higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio for death or the use of permanent assisted ventilation, 0.53; P=0.005). The likelihood of overall survival was higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.37; P=0.004), and infants with a shorter disease duration at screening were more likely than those with a longer disease duration to benefit from nusinersen. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. Among infants with spinal muscular atrophy, those who received nusinersen were more likely to be alive and have improvements in motor function than those in the control group. Early treatment may be necessary to maximize the benefit of the drug.

These cases are clinically categorized as King-Kopetzky syndrome (KKS), obscure auditory dysfunction (OAD), or auditory processing disorder (APD). While recent research has focussed on the possible mechanistic basis for these difficulties, the perceptions of the hearing difficulties that lead people to seek help have not hitherto been identified. This study presents findings from an observational survey of causal attributions of hearing difficulties from 100 people with KKS. The findings suggest that participants regard immunity and risk related causes of hearing difficulties as pre-dominant. Psychological factors were not considered to be causal for hearing difficulties. These factors were not affected by diagnostic classification. These findings inform audiologists about their patient beliefs for the first time. The authors suggest that clinicians take care to ensure that their counselling is responsive to these beliefs.",

A significant decrease in DPOAE levels in both ears was found in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome compared with the controls after considering the thresholds as a co-variable. It is noteworthy that the global mean levels of DPOAEs were still significantly greater in controls than in patients with matched thresholds. Further frequency analyses showed a significant decrease in DPOAE levels over the mid- and high-frequency range in patients with better hearing thresholds when compared with those in the control group. Moreover, significantly smaller DPOAEs were found in the ears of patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome and without SOAEs, than in such ears of control subjects after considering the thresholds as a co-variable. However, when SOAEs were present there was no difference. Decreases in DPOAE level appear to represent evidence of minor cochlear pathology, and provide a pathological basis for the difficulty of hearing speech in the presence of background noise, which characterizes King-Kopetzky syndrome.",

For some patients, minor disturbances in auditory function, e.g. a deteriorated signal-to-noise ratio for speech, can be demonstrated; for others, all measurements of hearing are normal. A conceptual framework developed for the analysis of communication disorders is applied to King-Kopetzky syndrome in the present article. The usefulness of the framework is evaluated, and an extended system for the analysis of King-Kopetzky syndrome patients is suggested. It is emphasized that changes in demands resulting from external conditions and altered perception and evaluation of the conditions may generate the symptoms. A change in the subjects' desired self-image (preferendum) and a change in social role, new, unfamiliar vocabulary, as well as minor dysfunctions in peripheral and central auditory processing, might generate the characteristic features of the syndrome. The framework is related to the current literature, and arguments for the usefulness of the framework in the planning of support and rehabilitation are presented. Several new questions are generated for further analysis of King-Kopetzky syndrome.",

The main reported disability is hearing speech in the presence of background noise. The degrees of speech-hearing disability in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome have been investigated with the use of the Social Hearing Handicap Index (SHHI), and the relationships between the SHHI scores and a number of physiological, psychoacoustical and psychological factors determined in 109 patients. The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency resolution or EOAEs. In a multiple stepwise regression, somatic anxiety and the performance of the sentence in noise test are the significant predictors of SHHI scores.

The main findings are that complaints were commonly focused on the categories of 'live speech' and 'electronic speech' difficulties in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome, particularly the auditory difficulties of speech in noise and group conversation. However, they reported problems with warning signals significantly less frequently than a control 'audiological rehabilitation' group and the patients studied by Barcham and Stephens (1980). In addition, main psychological problems were related to anxiety (e.g. irritability, nervousness and moodiness) in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome.

The success of the C. elegans genome sequencing project also inspired communities working on other organisms to approach genome sequencing of their species. The phylum Nematoda is rich and diverse and of interest to a wide range of research fields from basic biology through ecology and parasitic disease. For all these communities, it is now clear that access to genome scale data will be key to advancing understanding, and in the case of parasites, developing new ways to control or cure diseases. The advent of second-generation sequencing technologies, improvements in computing algorithms and infrastructure and growth in bioinformatics and genomics literacy is making the addition of genome sequencing to the research goals of any nematode research program a less daunting prospect. To inspire, promote and coordinate genomic sequencing across the diversity of the phylum, we have launched a community wiki and the 959 Nematode Genomes initiative (www.nematodegenomes.org/). Just as the deciphering of the developmental lineage of the 959 cells of the adult hermaphrodite C. elegans was the gateway to broad advances in biomedical science, we hope that a nematode phylogeny with (at least) 959 sequenced species will underpin further advances in understanding the origins of parasitism, the dynamics of genomic change and the adaptations that have made Nematoda one of the most successful animal phyla.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17387144": "We report evidence for a mechanism for the maintenance of long-range conserved synteny across vertebrate genomes. We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated \"bystander\" genes. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes. Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss of bystander genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target gene assignment. These findings explain the absence of evolutionary breakpoints from large vertebrate chromosomal segments and will aid in the recognition of position effect mutations within human GRBs.",

It is the first of a new class of drugs classified as dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs). Sedative hypnotics with central nervous system depressant effects feature prominently in forensic toxicology investigations. For this reason, a new analytical method was developed to identify suvorexant in urine using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Due to the absence of a commercially available isotopically labeled internal standard, estazolam-D5 was used due to its azepine, triazole and chlorinated functionality. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation was 10ng/mL and the linear range of the assay was 10-1000ng/mL. Accuracy and precision (%CV) were 98-101% and &lt;11% at 30, 250 and 800ng/mL. Interferences from matrix and fifty common drugs were not present and processed samples were stable for 24h at room temperature. Suvorexant is a new drug of significant forensic interest due to its hypnotic and central nervous system depressant effects. The absence of commercially available metabolites and its chromatographic properties present some challenges in terms of identification. Nevertheless, a robust, reliable and sensitive assay was developed to identify suvorexant using GC/MS analysis.",

In the years since, contributions from many investigators have revealed roles for orexins in addiction for all drugs of abuse tested, but only under select circumstances. We recently proposed that orexins play a fundamentally unified role in coordinating \"motivational activation\" under numerous behavioral conditions, and here we unpack this hypothesis as it applies to drug addiction. We describe evidence collected over the past 10 years that elaborates the role of orexin in drug seeking under circumstances where high levels of effort are required to obtain the drug, or when motivation for drug reward is augmented by the presence of external stimuli like drug-associated cues/contexts or stressors. Evidence from studies using traditional self-administration and reinstatement models, as well as behavioral economic analyses of drug demand elasticity, clearly delineates a role for orexin in modulating motivational, rather than the primary reinforcing aspects of drug reward. We also discuss the anatomical interconnectedness of the orexin system with wider motivation and reward circuits, with a particular focus on how orexin modulates prefrontal and other glutamatergic inputs onto ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Last, we look ahead to the next decade of the research in this area, highlighting the recent FDA approval of the dual orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant (Belsomra<sup>\u00ae</sup>) for the treatment of insomnia as a promising sign of the potential clinical utility of orexin-based therapies for the treatment of addiction.",

Because of its pharmacology within the central nervous system, intended therapeutic indication, and first-in-class status, an assessment of suvorexant abuse liability potential was required prior to marketing approval. The nonclinical abuse liability potential studies for suvorexant included: 1) rat drug-dependence model to assess physical dependence following abrupt cessation; 2) rat drug-discrimination model to examine the potential similarity of the interoceptive or subjective effects of suvorexant to those elicited by zolpidem and morphine; 3) self-administration model to assess the relative reinforcing efficacy of suvorexant in rhesus monkeys conditioned to self-administer methohexital. No significant signs of spontaneous drug withdrawal or 'discontinuation syndrome' were observed in rats following abrupt discontinuation of suvorexant. Suvorexant did not elicit complete cross-generalization to either a zolpidem or morphine training/reference stimuli in rats, and suvorexant was devoid of behavioral evidence of positive reinforcing efficacy in monkeys. These nonclinical findings suggested that suvorexant will have low abuse potential in humans. In the final regulatory risk assessment, suvorexant was placed into Schedule IV, likely due to its first-in-class status, its sedative properties, and the outcome of the clinical abuse potential assessment.",

The current studies describe suvorexant's absorption, disposition and potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions in humans. 2. Following single oral administration of [(14)C]suvorexant to healthy human subjects, 90% of the radioactivity was recovered (66% in faeces, 23% in urine), primarily as oxidative metabolites. 3. In plasma, suvorexant and M9 were predominant, accounting for 30 and 37% of the total radioactivity, respectively. Metabolite M17 became more prominent (approaching 10%) following multiple daily doses of unlabelled suvorexant. M9 and M17 are not expected to contribute to the pharmacological activity of suvorexant due to reduced orexin receptor binding affinity and limited brain penetration. 4. CYP3A was determined to be the predominant enzyme mediating suvorexant oxidation.

Patients may have acute episodes of insomnia related to a traumatic event, but more commonly insomnia occurs chronically. While proper sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy play important roles in the nonpharmacologic management of short-term and chronic insomnia, medications may also be required. Historically, insomnia has been treated with agents such as benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin agonists. Dual orexin receptor antagonists represent a new class of medications for the treatment of insomnia, which block the binding of wakefulness-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their respective receptor sites. Suvorexant (Belsomra) is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist to be approved in the US and Japan and has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing time to sleep onset and increasing total sleep time. Its unique mechanism of action, data to support efficacy and safety over 12 months of use, and relative lack of withdrawal effects when discontinued may represent an alternative for patients with chronic insomnia who cannot tolerate or do not receive benefit from more traditional sleep agents. Suvorexant is effective and well tolerated, but precautions exist for certain patient populations, including females, obese patients, and those with respiratory disease. Suvorexant has only been studied vs placebo, and hence it is unknown how it directly compares with other medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia. Suvorexant is not likely to replace benzodiazepines or nonbenzodiazepine receptor antagonists as a first-line sleep agent but does represent a novel option for the treatment of patients with chronic insomnia.",

We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2 days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose &gt; 500 mg/dL and ketones of 80 mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93 mg/dL.

This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis.

Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly. Regarding other adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia even when co-administered with insulin, but a decrease in the dose of sulphonylureas may be needed. The available data do not point to a causative role of SGLT2 inhibitors on malignancy risk, however, these drugs should be used with caution in patients with known hematuria or history of bladder cancer.

Breast cancer occurs in male-to-female transsexuals who receive high doses of exogenous estrogen and develop breast tissue histologically identical to that of a biologically female breast. This exposure to estrogen results in increased risk of breast cancer.

Case reports have led to suggestions that men with Klinefelter syndrome have elevated risks of several cancers, but published cohort studies have been relatively small. We conducted a nationwide cohort study to examine these risks. We followed a cohort of 3518 men who had been cytogenetically diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome in Britain from 1959 through 2002 and compared their cancer incidence and mortality with that of men in the national population. All statistical tests were two-sided. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all cancers was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 1.4). Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.6) and lower mortality from prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7).

Overall, the epidemiology of MBC presents similarities with the epidemiology of female breast cancer. Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. Suspected genetic factors include AR gene mutations, CYP17 polymorphism, Cowden syndrome, and CHEK2. Epidemiologic risk factors for MBC include disorders relating to hormonal imbalances, such as obesity, testicular disorders (e.g., cryptorchidism, mumps orchitis, and orchiectomy), and radiation exposure.

These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task. Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028923": " Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition. We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions.

Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \"mixed-membership models\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering.

The long-term inflammatory and metabolic dysfunction associated with MetS may contribute to osteoarthritic processes leading up to total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The purpose of this study was to investigate levels of metabolic biomarkers and the prevalence of MetS in patients undergoing TJA. Under IRB approval, citrated plasma samples were collected from 41 patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) preoperatively and day 1 postoperatively. Control group consisted of 25 healthy human plasma samples (female and male, 18-35 years old) purchased from George King Biomedical Inc. (Overland Park, KS, USA). Samples were profiled for c-peptide, ferritin, IL-6, insulin, resistin, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1a, leptin, and PAI-1 using metabolic biochips purchased from RANDOX Co. (Antrim, Northern Ireland). NCEP/ATP III guidelines were used to evaluate which patients met MetS criteria. Levels of IL-6, resistin, TNF-a, IL-1a, leptin, and PAI-1 were significantly elevated in patients undergoing TJA compared to normal. C-peptide and insulin were both decreased in TJA compared to normal. No significance was found when comparing TJA to normal for ferritin. TNF\u03b1 was significantly lower in TJA+MetS compared to TJA-MetS, while other biomarkers showed no difference in TJA\u00b1MetS populations. Insulin &amp; c-peptide both showed a significant decrease in TJA-MetS compared to normal, but levels in TJA+MetS patients were not significantly different from controls. Resistin showed significant increases in TJA+MetS vs. normal, but not in TJA-MetS vs. normal. Overall, the differing metabolic profile seen in patients undergoing TJA suggest ongoing metabolic dysfunction. Insulin and c-peptide patterns among the different test groups hint toward a complex and dysfunctional metabolic process involved, with leptin and underlying insulin resistance playing a role. Increased resistin in TJA+MetS, but not in TJA-MetS, compared to normal, suggests that while elevated resistin levels may be associated with the osteoarthritic process, levels are further attenuated by MetS, which is highly prevalent in this population. Increased TNF\u03b1 in TJA-MetS compared to TJA+MetS may be an artifact of differing sample populations or a true complication of the complex pathophysiology and medical regimen seen in patients with both OA and MetS. The lack of difference seen in the remaining biomarkers suggest that having MetS as a comorbidity does not contribute to the elevated levels seen in patients undergoing TJA.",

Prediabetes, which is a combination of excess body fat and insulin resistance, is considered an underlying etiology of metabolic syndrome. Prediabetes manifests as impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance. Impaired fasting glucose is defined as a fasting blood glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance requires a blood glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a 75-g oral intake of glucose. In patients with prediabetes, the rate of progression to diabetes within 3 years can be decreased by approximately 58% with lifestyle modifications. These include weight loss through exercise (30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week) and dietary modifications. Recommended diets are high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish. Consumption of sweetened beverages, including diet soda, should be avoided. For patients who do not achieve goals with lifestyle modifications, metformin can be considered. Weight loss drugs and bariatric surgery are appropriate for select patients.

MetS, estimated to affect 25% of adults in the United States, is associated with a fivefold increase in the risk of developing diabetes, a doubling of the risk of acquiring cardiovascular disease, and an increase in overall mortality. Defined as a syndrome, MetS is recognized clinically by numerous constitutive traits, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hyperglycemia. Urologic complications of MetS include a 30% higher risk of nephrolithiasis, with an increased percentage of uric acid nephrolithiasis in the setting of hyperuricemia, hyperuricosuria, low urine pH, and low urinary volume. Current American Urological Association and European Association of Urology guidelines suggest investigating the etiology of nephrolithiasis in affected individuals; however, there is no specific goal of treating MetS as part of the medical management. Weight loss and exercise, the main lifestyle treatments of MetS, counter abdominal obesity and insulin resistance and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and the development of diabetes. These recommendations may offer a beneficial adjunctive treatment option for nephrolithiasis complicated by MetS. Although definitive therapeutic recommendations must await further studies, it seems both reasonable and justifiable for the urologist, as part of a multidisciplinary team, to recommend these important lifestyle changes to patients with both conditions. These recommendations should accompany the currently accepted management of nephrolithiasis.",

For example, the BMI risk threshold may be higher in blacks than in whites and higher in women than in men. Furthermore, a WC that predicts an obese BMI in white women only predicts a BMI in the overweight category in black women. In addition, overweight black men have a greater risk of developing type 2 DM than do overweight black women. Although TG levels are excellent predictors of insulin resistance in whites, they are not effective markers of insulin resistance in blacks.

Anthropometry and fasting lipid, glucose and insulin levels were measured in a cohort of 1251 African females participating in the Birth to Twenty cohort study in Soweto, Johannesburg. The waist circumference cut points for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (as defined using the new harmonised guidelines), insulin resistance, dysglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were obtained using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. The prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome were 50.1%, 14.3% and 42.1%, respectively.

The present data demonstrates that urban, African females have a high prevalence of obesity and related disorders and the waist cut point currently recommended for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome (80.0 cm) in this population should be increased to 91.5 cm. This latter finding demonstrates a clear ethnic difference in the relationship between abdominal adiposity and metabolic disease risk. The similar waist cut points identified for the detection of the individual components of the metabolic syndrome and related cardiovascular risk factors demonstrates that the risk for different metabolic diseases increases at the same level of abdominal adiposity suggesting a common aetiological pathway.",

Insulin resistance is also associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes which is strongly associated with obesity. The insulin resistance of obese people and subjects with type 2 diabetes is characterised by defects at many levels, affecting insulin receptor concentration, glucose transport mechanisms and the activities of intracellular enzymes. Around 25% of western populations show some features of the insulin resistance syndrome (often referred to as syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome) ie, a clustering of metabolic, atheromatous risk factors, including hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hyper-tension, hypercholesterinaemia and obesity. However, the known metabolic cardiovascular risk factors associated with the insulin resistance syndrome do not sufficiently explain the excess vascular risk attributed to this syndrome. The observation, that increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels were associated with insulin resistance and atherothrombosis added for the first time a pathological basis for an association of the insulin resistance syndrome not only with metabolic, atheromatous (atherosclerotic) risk but also with atherothrombotic risk. It is very likely that not only PAI-1, but also other abnormalities in haemostatic variables contribute to this excess vascular risk. Knowledge of how haemostatic variables cluster with classical metabolic risk factors associated with the insulin resistance syndrome could help to better understand the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, many coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins have been shown to be associated with features of the insulin resistance syndrome and these associations suggest that some coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins have a role in atherothrombotic disorders, principally through an association with other established metabolic (atheromatous) risk factors in the presence of underlying insulin resistance. Interestingly, new therapeutic approaches in the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance do show some influence on coagulation and fibrinolysis.

In some insulin-resistant individuals, insulin secretion will begin to deteriorate under chronic stress (glucose toxicity) and overt diabetes will result. If not, individuals will remain hyperinsulinemic, with perhaps some degree of glucose intolerance, together with other hallmarks of the IRS. The statistical correlation between hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance is clear, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Epidemiologic evidence of insulin resistance as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) completed the evolving concept of IRS as the common soil for the development of both diabetes and CHD. No single laboratory test exists for diagnosis of IRS. Rather, IRS remains a clinically evident syndrome that can be suspected on the basis of physical and laboratory findings. This identifies individual patients whom the clinician should screen for associated comorbid conditions, aggressively control cardiovascular risk factors, and tailor drug therapy for optimal benefit. This article provides practical guidelines to achieve these goals and specific strategies to ameliorate cardiovascular and metabolic risk in the IRS.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16762931": "\"The metabolic syndrome\" is the name for a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes that are of metabolic origin. These risk factors consist of atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state. There are 2 major, interacting causes of the metabolic syndrome-obesity and endogenous metabolic susceptibility. The latter typically is manifested by insulin resistance. The metabolic syndrome is accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease and a 5-fold increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes. A clinical diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome is useful because it affects therapeutic strategy in patients at higher risk. However, there are 2 views about the best therapeutic strategy for patients with the metabolic syndrome. One view holds that each of the metabolic risk factors should be singled out and treated separately. The other view holds that greater emphasis should be given to implementing therapies that will reduce all of the risk factors simultaneously. The latter approach emphasizes lifestyle therapies (weight reduction and increased exercise), which target all of the risk factors. This approach is also the foundation of other therapies for targeting multiple risk factors together by striking at the underlying causes, as in the development of drugs to promote weight reduction and to reduce insulin resistance. Treating the underlying causes does not rule out the management of individual risk factors, but it will add strength to the control of multiple risk factors.",

The first goal of this study was to determine the frequency of the Metabolic Syndrome X (MSX) in patients with acute myocardial infarction compared with the general population. The second goal of the study was to examine the frequency of heart failure and reinfarction rate in the patients with myocardial infarction, with and without MSX. Furthermore, the relationship between gender and MSX was analyzed. A total of 101 patients with acute myocardial infarction took part in randomized trial (32 women and 69 men). MSX and all of its components were diagnosed according to WHO criteria. To determine statistical significance of our results, we used chi2 test and t-test for independent samples. From 101 patient 48 had MSX (47.52%), while in the general population incidence of MSX is 3-4%. The reinfarction and the heart failure rate were significantly higher in the group of patients with MSX (p = 0.0067 and p = 0.0217, respectively).

We sought to understand whether mGluR5's role in AD requires glutamate signaling. We used a potent mGluR5 silent allosteric modulator (SAM, BMS-984923) to separate its well-known physiological role in glutamate signaling from a pathological role in mediating amyloid-\u03b2 oligomer (A\u03b2o) action. Binding of the SAM to mGluR5 does not change glutamate signaling but strongly reduces mGluR5 interaction with cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) bound to A\u03b2o. The SAM compound prevents A\u03b2o-induced signal transduction in brain slices and in an AD transgenic mouse model, the APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 strain. Critically, 4 weeks of SAM treatment rescues memory deficits and synaptic depletion in the APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 transgenic mouse brain. Our data show that mGluR5's role in A\u03b2o-dependent AD phenotypes is separate from its role in glutamate signaling and silent allosteric modulation of mGluR5 has promise as a disease-modifying AD intervention with a broad therapeutic window.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148681": "Soluble Amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2o) can trigger Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology by binding to cell surface cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). PrP(C) interacts physically with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), and this interaction controls the transmission of neurotoxic signals to intracellular substrates. Because the interruption of the signal transduction from PrP(C) to mGluR5 has therapeutic potential for AD, we developed assays to explore the effect of endogenous ligands, agonists/antagonists, and antibodies on the interaction between PrP(C) and mGluR5 in cell lines and mouse brain. We show that the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153 mediates the interaction with mGluR5. Agonists of mGluR5 increase the mGluR5-PrP(C) interaction, whereas mGluR5 antagonists suppress protein association. Synthetic A\u03b2o promotes the protein interaction in mouse brain and transfected HEK-293 cell membrane preparations. The interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is enhanced dramatically in the brains of familial AD transgenic model mice. In brain homogenates with A\u03b2o, the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is reversed by mGluR5-directed antagonists or antibodies directed against the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153. Silent allosteric modulators of mGluR5 do not alter Glu or basal mGluR5 activity, but they disrupt the A\u03b2o-induced interaction of mGluR5 with PrP(C). The assays described here have the potential to identify and develop new compounds that inhibit the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by transmitting the signal from extracellular A\u03b2o into the cytosol.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28363334": "Drug resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy is limiting the therapeutic efficacy of most anticancer drugs and represents a major obstacle in medical oncology. However, treatment of various human malignancies with biologics, mostly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), is not limited by such chemoresistance mechanisms. However, other resistance or evasion mechanisms limit the efficacy to anticancer therapeutic mAbs that engage tumor-associated antigens on the surface of the malignant cells. Immune checkpoint blocking monoclonal antibodies are heralded as a promising therapeutic approach in clinical oncology. These mAbs do not directly attack the malignant cells as most anticancer mAbs; rather, they enhance the anti-tumor response of the immune system by targeting immune regulatory pathways. Three mAbs targeting immune checkpoint molecules are currently used in the clinic and new mAbs that target other potential inhibitory targets are being actively investigated. This therapeutic approach, while proving as highly beneficial for many patients, is prone to toxicities and side effects of an autoimmune nature. Defining suitable management algorithms and biomarkers that predict therapeutic effects and adverse toxicity are required to provide survival benefit for larger numbers of cancer patients. Overcoming these challenges, along with opportunities for new agents and combinatorial strategies are the main focus of immune checkpoint blockade research today.",

Although the safety profile of these compounds, with particular reference to drugs targeting programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), is generally considered manageable, peculiar, immune-related toxicities may onset. Areas covered: This review focuses on the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) observed during immune check-point blockade in NSCLC and their management. The authors report the incidence of irAEs based on the currently available data involving NSCLC and provide recommendations on the general approach to irAEs, as well as indications for the most relevant site-specific events. Expert opinion: Since irAEs may involve a wide range of organs and systems and are potentially reversible if promptly treated, early diagnosis should always be achieved; this might be particularly challenging when other potential causes of toxicity are suspected, such as infections or concurrent treatments. Finally, drugs active on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis appear to be generally manageable even when they are administered to patients with relevant comorbidities, provided that adequate clinical monitoring is performed.",

The survival of tumors in several cases is assisted by checkpoint immunomodulation to maintain the imbalance between immune surveillance and cancer cell proliferation. Check point antibody inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1, are a novel class of inhibitors that function as a tumor suppressing factor via modulation of immune cell-tumor cell interaction. These checkpoint blockers are rapidly becoming a highly promising cancer therapeutic approach that yields remarkable antitumor responses with limited side effects. In recent times, more than four check point antibody inhibitors have been commercialized for targeting PD-1, PDL-1, and CTLA-4. Despite the huge success and efficacy of the anti-PD therapy response, it is limited to specific types of cancers, which attributes to the insufficient and heterogeneous expression of PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment.

Immunotherapy in gynecological cancers could help to revert immunosuppression and lymphocyte depletion due to prior treatments. Current immunotherapies for ovarian cancer, like all cancer immunotherapy, are based on either stimulating the immune system or reverting immune suppression. Several approaches have been used, including therapeutic vaccines, monoclonal antibodies; checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer. Most of these therapies are still in early-phase testing (phase I and II) for ovarian cancer, but the initial data in ovarian cancer and successful use in other types of cancers suggests some of these approaches may ultimately prove useful for ovarian cancer as well. Ovarian cancer vaccines have shown only a modest benefit in ovarian cancer when used as monotherapy, but these agents may be able to enhance antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, or other immunotherapies. Monoclonal antibodies have been explored in ovarian cancer but despite encouraging phase II data, randomized studies failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit. Check point inhibitors have promising activity in several solid tumors and have demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile. Data from early clinical trials utilizing PD1 and PD-L1 inhibitors showed encouraging results. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of check point inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy. Adoptive T cell transfer involves the infusion of ex vivo activated and expanded tumor specific T cells, using various sources and types of T cells. While this approach has been explored in several hematologic malignancies, it constitutes early research in ovarian cancer. Immunotherapy remains investigational in ovarian cancer and the benefit of this approach in improving progression-free survival (PFS) or OS is unknown. Previous clinical trials have not selected patients based on biomarkers and this may explain the negative results. We expect to discover that tumor response will relate to the patient's immune features and specific tumor characteristics. We are only beginning to realize the potential of immunotherapy for ovarian cancer patients, and one goal of future clinical trials will be to identify subsets of patient based on histologic, molecular, and immune characteristics.",

The fourth BBN receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described.

Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA was determined using in vitro binding studies using membrane target system containing specific receptor subtypes. We investigated the distribution of binding sites for (177)Lu-AMBA by receptor autoradiography on human neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. Pharmacological characterizations of (177)Lu-AMBA shows, high affinity towards NMB and GRP receptors, while little or no affinity towards BB(3) receptor.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from carcinoids of intestinal origin. Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and determine BLP levels in these tumors. All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels. The combined presence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine or autocrine growth loop in carcinoids.",

However, the molecular basis of this property is unclear and is the subject of this study. To accomplish this, site-directed mutagenesis was used after identifying potentially important amino acids using sequence homology analysis of all BnRs with high affinity for Univ.Lig compared to the Cholecystokinin-receptor (CCK(A)R), which has low affinity. Using various criteria 74 amino acids were identified and 101 mutations made in GRPR by changing each to those of CCK(A)R or to alanine. 22 GRPR mutations showed a significant decrease in affinity for Univ.Lig (&gt;2-fold) with 2 in EC2[D97N, G112V], 1 in UTM6[Y284A], 2 in EC4[R287N, H300S] showing &gt;10-fold decrease in Univ.Lig affinity. Additional mutations were made to explore the molecular basis for these changes. Our results show that high affinity for Univ.Lig by human Bn-receptors requires positively charged amino acids in extracellular (EC)-domain 4 and to a lesser extent EC2 and EC3 suggesting charge-charge interactions may be particularly important for determining the general high affinity of this ligand. Furthermore, transmembrane amino acids particularly in UTM6 are important contributing both charge-charge interactions as well as interaction with a tyrosine residue in close proximity suggesting possible receptor-peptide cation-\u03c0 or H-bonding interactions are also important for determining its high affinity.",

In this report, we demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides, neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and GRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for BLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and/or receptor subtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially recognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in the BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The 2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that showed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against the 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), compared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and NMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and GRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and expression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and expression of the GRP receptor. If BLP ligand-receptor systems are to be targeted therapeutically in NSCLC, it will be necessary to inhibit both NMB and GRP.",

Ninety-three patients who underwent a diagnostic CT scan before laparotomy for a GI tract perforation were included. The readers assessed the presence of specific air distributions on CT (periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs). The readers also assessed the presence of strong predictors of gastroduodenal perforation (focal defects in the stomach and duodenal bulb wall, concentrated extraluminal air bubbles in close proximity to the stomach and duodenal bulb, and wall thickening at the stomach and duodenal bulb). The specific air distributions were assessed according to perforation sites, and the elapsed time and amount of free air, and then compared with the strong predictors of gastroduodenal perforation by using statistical analysis. All specific air distributions were more frequently present in patients with gastroduodenal perforation than lower GI tract perforation, but only the falciform ligament sign was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). The presence of all three specific air distributions was demonstrated in only 13 (20.6%) of 63 patients with gastroduodenal perforation. Regardless of the perforation sites, the falciform ligament sign was present significantly more frequently with an increase in the amount of free air on multiple logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; p&lt;0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive and negative predictive values of each strong predictor for the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation were higher than those of specific air distributions. The focal wall thickening (accuracy, 95.7%) was the most useful parameter for the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation.

According to the distribution of free air, we divided the peritoneal cavity into supramesocolic compartment and inframesocolic compartment. We observed the presence or absence of free air in each compartment in each group. When there was free air in the periportal area, it was defined as periportal free air (PPFA) and the sign was positive. To evaluate the usefulness of the PPFA sign, we compared the PPFA sign with the falciform ligament sign and the ligamentum teres sign, both of which are well-known CT signs of pneumoperitoneum. Statistical analyses were performed with univariate and multivariate analyses using SPSS version 11.5 for significant findings among the CT signs. Free air was seen in supramesocolic compartment in 29 of 30 (97%) patients in the upper GI perforation group and in 17 of 23 (74%) in the lower GI perforation group. Free air in inframesocolic compartment did not show significant difference in either group (p=.16). The PPFA sign was seen in 28 of 30 (93%) patients with upper GI tract perforation, but in only 8 of 23 (35%) patients with lower GI tract perforation (p&lt;.0001). The falciform ligament sign was seen in 24 of 30 (80%) patients with upper GI tract perforation and in 10 of 23 (43%) patients with lower GI tract perforation (p=.020). The ligamentum teres sign was seen in 16 of 30 (53%) patients with upper GI tract perforation and in 2 of 23 (8%) patients with lower GI tract perforation (p=.008). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the PPFA sign was the only variable, which adjusted odds ratio of 15.5 (p=.002). The PPFA sign is a useful finding which can help to distinguish upper from lower GI tract perforation. When this sign is present, upper GI tract perforation is strongly suggested.",

Supine films from 44 cases of pneumoperitoneum were randomly interspersed among supine films from 87 control subjects without free air, and the films were reviewed for the presence or absence of various signs of pneumoperitoneum, including Rigler's sign (gas on both sides of the bowel wall), the falciform ligament sign (gas outlining the falciform ligament), the football sign (gas outlining the peritoneal cavity), the inverted-V sign (gas outlining the medial umbilical folds), and the right-upper-quadrant gas sign (localized gas in the right upper quadrant). One or more of these signs were present in 26 cases (59%) of pneumoperitoneum, including the right-upper-quadrant gas sign in 18 cases (41%), Rigler's sign in 14 cases (32%), and the falciform ligament and football signs in one case each (2%). Unfortunately, there were frequent errors in the interpretation of the right-upper-quadrant gas sign and Rigler's sign, with a total of 11 false-positive cases (13%). Further analysis of the true-positive right-upper-quadrant gas signs showed that these gas collections were always triangular or linear with an inferolateral to superomedial orientation and, if triangular, a concave superolateral border. In the true-positive Rigler's signs, the bowel wall thickness ranged from 1 to 8 mm, whereas the false positives all had a bowel wall thickness of 1 mm or less. Proper interpretation of the various signs of pneumoperitoneum on supine films should lead to more accurate diagnosis of this condition.",

Forty-two patients with 10 cases of proximal GI perforation and 32 cases of distal GI perforation were evaluated based on the CT findings of extraluminal air (which was subdivided into the CT-falciform ligament sign crossing the midline and scattered pockets of air), bowel wall thickening (&gt;8 mm in gastroduodenal wall, &gt;3 mm in the small bowel wall, &gt;6 mm in the caliber of the appendix and &gt;5 mm in the colonic wall), associated abscess formation, ascites and adjacent fat stranding. The results were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Detection of extraluminal air in the upright plain films and CT was analyzed by Z test. Our results showed that CT-falciform ligament sign was more frequent in the proximal GI perforation, while pockets of extraluminal air (excluding the cases accompanying CT-falciform ligament sign), bowel wall thickening and fat stranding were found in higher incidence in distal GI perforation (P&lt;.05). CT detected extraluminal air in more cases than the upright plain films did (69% vs. 19%; Z=4.62&gt;Z(0.01)=2.326).

Patients received oral vorinostat (300 or 400 mg/day) on days 1-5 weekly during temozolomide chemoradiation. Following a 4- to 6-week rest, patients received up to 12 cycles of standard adjuvant temozolomide and vorinostat (400 mg/day) on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each 28-day cycle. Association between vorinostat response signatures and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed based on RNA sequencing of baseline tumor tissue. Phase I and phase II enrolled 15 and 107 patients, respectively. The combination therapy MTD was vorinostat 300 mg/day and temozolomide 75 mg/m2/day. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase elevation, hyperglycemia, fatigue, and wound dehiscence. The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase II cohort, OS rate at 15 months, was 55.1% (median OS 16.1 mo), and consequently, the study did not meet its efficacy objective. Most common treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicities in the phase II component were lymphopenia (32.7%), thrombocytopenia (28.0%), and neutropenia (21.5%). RNA expression profiling of baseline tumors (N = 76) demonstrated that vorinostat resistance (sig-79) and sensitivity (sig-139) signatures had a reverse and positive association with OS/PFS, respectively. Vorinostat combined with standard chemoradiation had acceptable tolerability in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

In patients with sulfa allergies, dapsone prophylaxis is often used due to its efficacy, long half-life, cost effectiveness, and general safety at low doses. However, dapsone may uncommonly induce a hemolytic anemia, particularly in patients deficient of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This hemolysis is thought to be a result of oxidative stress on red blood cells induced by dapsone metabolites which produce reactive oxygen species that disrupt the red blood cell membrane and promote splenic sequestration. A single case report of dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia in a patient with glioblastoma multiforme has been reported. We present two patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. There are several potential mechanisms by which histone deacetylase inhibition may alter dapsone metabolism including changes in hepatic acetylation or N-glucuronidation leading to an increase in the bioavailability of dapsone's hematotoxic metabolites. In addition, vorinostat may lead to increased hemolysis through inhibition of heat shock protein-90, a chaperone protein that maintains the integrity of the red blood cell membrane cytoskeleton. The potential interaction between dapsone and vorinostat may have important clinical implications as more than 10 clinical trials evaluating drug combinations with vorinostat in patients with malignant glioma are either ongoing or planned in North America.",

Enzymatic modifications of histone proteins regulating gene expression are being exploited for therapeutic drug targeting. Over the last decade, numerous studies have shown promising results with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in various malignancies. This article provides a brief overview of mechanism of anti-cancer effect and pharmacology of HDAC inhibitors and summarizes results from pre-clinical and clinical studies in glioblastoma. It analyses experience with HDAC inhibitors as single agents as well as in combination with targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hallmark features of glioblastoma, such as uncontrolled cellular proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis, have been shown to be targeted by HDAC inhibitors in experiments with glioblastoma cell lines. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting. While the results from pre-clinical studies are encouraging, early clinical trials showed only modest benefit and the value of HDAC inhibitors for clinical practice will need to be confirmed in larger prospective trials. Further research in epigenetic mechanisms driving glioblastoma pathogenesis and identification of molecular subtypes of glioblastoma is needed. This will hopefully lead to better selection of patients who will benefit from treatment with HDAC inhibitors.",

Vorinostat was escalated up to 2 actively investigated doses of this compound or until the MTD was identified on the basis of DLTs. Correlative science involving proteomic profiling of serial patient plasma samples was performed. Nineteen patients were treated.

These tools allow for a small number of mismatches in the alignment; however, their ability to allow for gaps varies greatly, with many performing poorly or not allowing them at all. The seed-and-extend strategy is applied in most short-read alignment programmes. After aligning a substring of the reference sequence against the high-quality prefix of a short read--the seed--an important problem is to find the best possible alignment between a substring of the reference sequence succeeding and the remaining suffix of low quality of the read--extend. The fact that the reads are rather short and that the gap occurrence frequency observed in various studies is rather low suggest that aligning (parts of) those reads with a single gap is in fact desirable. In this article, we present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise short-read alignments. Apart from the standard CPU version, it includes ultrafast SSE- and GPU-based implementations. libgapmis is based on an algorithm computing a modified version of the traditional dynamic-programming matrix for sequence alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the functions of the CPU version provided in this library accelerate the computations by a factor of 20 compared to other programmes. The analogous SSE- and GPU-based implementations accelerate the computations by a factor of 6 and 11, respectively, compared to the CPU version. The library also provides the user the flexibility to split the read into fragments, based on the observed gap occurrence frequency and the length of the read, thereby allowing for a variable, but bounded, number of gaps in the alignment. We present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise short-read alignments. We show that libgapmis is better-suited and more efficient than existing algorithms for this task. The importance of our contribution is underlined by the fact that the provided functions may be seamlessly integrated into any short-read alignment pipeline.

However, the regulatory mechanism of BCL10 in OSCC progression is still unknown. Here, we showed that knockdown of endogenous BCL10 could significantly reduce cell migration and invasion abilities, retard cell proliferation by G0/G1 phase accumulation and inhibit tumorigenicity in vivo. In molecular level, we identified S100P as a crucial downstream effector of BCL10-inhibited OSCC progression by high-throughput microarray analysis. S100P messenger RNA and protein expression levels were significantly diminished in silenced-BCL10 clones, and transfected S100P expression plasmids restored migration, invasion, proliferation abilities and tumorigenicity in shBCL10 transfectants. Furthermore, we provided evidence that BCL10 regulated S100P expression through signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Knockdown of BCL10 decreased S100P promoter activity, but showed no effect in truncated STAT1/ATF4 S100P promoter. In addition, we also found that the P50/P65 signaling pathway was involved in BCL10-enhanced OSCC progression.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27211800": "Hypoxia is a major hallmark of the tumor microenvironment that is strictly associated with rapid cancer progression and induction of metastasis. Hypoxia inhibits disulfide bond formation and impairs protein folding in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The stress in the ER induces the activation of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathways via the induction of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). As a result, the level of phosphorylated Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) is markedly elevated, resulting in the promotion of a pro-adaptive signaling pathway by the inhibition of global protein synthesis and selective translation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). On the contrary, during conditions of prolonged ER stress, pro-adaptive responses fail and apoptotic cell death ensues. Interestingly, similar to the activity of the mitochondria, the ER may also directly activate the apoptotic pathway through ER stress-mediated leakage of calcium into the cytoplasm that leads to the activation of death effectors. Apoptotic cell death also ensues by ATF4-CHOP- mediated induction of several pro-apoptotic genes and suppression of the synthesis of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Advancing molecular insight into the transition of tumor cells from adaptation to apoptosis under hypoxia-induced ER stress may provide answers on how to overcome the limitations of current anti-tumor therapies. Targeting components of the UPR pathways may provide more effective elimination of tumor cells and as a result, contribute to the development of more promising anti-tumor therapeutic agents.",

Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes. Strikingly, primary embryo fibroblasts from ATF4-deficient mice were resistant to transformation by coexpression of H-ras(V12) and SV40 large T antigen. In wild-type cells these oncogenes induced expression of the murine Atf4 gene along with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a, which encodes the cell senescence-associated proteins p16INK4 and p19ARF. Elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation. Conversely, genetic ablation of ATF4 led to constitutive expression of p16INK4a and p19ARF, triggering cellular senescence. Our findings define a central function for ATF4 in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence.",

Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a member of the ATF/CREB family, has been reported to be related to tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we found that exogenous overexpression of ATF4 in mouse breast cancer cells promotes tumor growth via increasing tumor microvascular density. However, ATF4 overexpression failed to increase the expression level of a series of proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in tumor cells in this model. Thus, we further investigated the infiltration of proangiogenic macrophages in tumor tissues and found that ATF4-overexpressing tumors could recruit more macrophages via secretion of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF).

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan (CT-scan) of the abdomen revealed multiple low density foci with homogeneous structure and clear contours in both lobes of the liver. Histologically, proliferation of medium sized lymphoma cells with round-oval and slightly irregular nuclei with fine chromatin was shown. Immunohistochemical and molecular features of the tumors allowed diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To exclude secondary liver lesion by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chest and small pelvis CT-scan, endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and study of bone marrow were performed. After 8 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), the complete remission was achieved, which persists after 45 months of follow-up. Primary hepatic lymphomas are extremely rare, and previously only low-grade hepatic lymphomas have been described in SS. To our knowledge, the patient described here represents the first reported case of DLBCL with primary liver involvement in SS.",

The most appropriate use of biologics would appear to be in patients with severe or multisystem features of SS, but their use early in the pathogenesis has the potential to prevent disease progression. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha blockade has not proven effective in SS. B-cell depletion using rituximab has been of benefit, mainly in relation to extraglandular features, and to some extent in relation to hyposalivation where there is still residual salivary function. Rituximab is also effective in the treatment of SS-associated (extrasalivary) lymphomas, although the therapeutic response in salivary lymphoma is poorer. Rituximab is given as a single or periodic intravenous infusion. Potential adverse effects exist, notably infusion reactions and infection, and so a full risk/benefit analysis is indicated for prospective patients. This and clinical use is best performed and monitored in conjunction with rheumatologists with appropriate training and experience in biologic therapies. Further studies of rituximab in SS are ongoing, and newer agents under trial include belimumab.",

We have described two cases: one with MALT lymphoma in the parotid glands and the other with a rare thymus lymphoma accompanied by the rare complication of a bullous pneumopathy. Both were treated with RTX at haematological doses, which was unsuccessful in the patient with a salivary lymphoma; in the case of the patient with a thymus lymphoma, the mediastinum mass disappeared and did not relapse.

Whether peripheral neuropathy is a feature of the systemic or glandular disease or whether it is related to a circulating antineuronal antibody remains also uncertain. The authors reviewed the records of patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS), fulfilling the Revised European-American Classification Criteria, seen in their department from 1992 to 2009. The patients with previously recorded neuropathic features were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically. Other causes of polyneuropathy were excluded. The authors also searched for circulating antineural antibodies using immunofluorescence and western blot and for antibodies against muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential biomarkers. 509 cases met the diagnostic criteria for pSS. Among these, 44 patients were recorded as having neuropathic symptoms. After completing the evaluation, however, only nine (1.8%) had polyneuropathy with objective clinical signs and abnormal electrophysiological findings. The neuropathy was axonal in all, in five pure sensory and in four sensorimotor. The patients with peripheral neuropathy had extraglandular manifestations such as palpable purpura and vasculitis. No evidence of antineural autoimmunity was found, and no candidate biomarkers were identified. Polyneuropathy is a rare manifestation of pSS occurring in 1.8% of patients.

Although Sj\u00f6gren syndrome occurs in all age groups in both women and men, women in their fourties are the most affected. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can occur alone or in the presence of another connective tissue disease, respectively called primary and secundary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. When two of the three clinical hallmarks: keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia or connective tissue disease are present, Sj\u00f6gren 's syndrome should be considered. To confirm the diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome several tests are required. e.g. blood tests, ophthalmologic tests and oral tests. Rheumatologists have the primary responsibility for managing Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Other specialists can treat the related symptoms. The incidence of lymphoma is higher in patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome than in the general population. Therefore patients must be monitored carefully for the development of related autoimmune diseases, lymphoma and other complications.

The majority of SS-associated NHLs are characterized by localized stage, indolent clinical course, and recurrence in other extranodal sites. Although the transition from a chronic inflammatory condition to malignant lymphoma is a multistep process yet poorly understood, there is increasing evidence that chronic antigenic stimulation by an exoantigen or autoantigens plays an essential role in the development of SS associated lymphoproliferation. Additional molecular oncogenic events such as microsatellite instability, loss of the B cell cycle control, and the forced overproduction of specific B cell biologic stimulators seem to contribute to the emergence and progression of the malignant overgrowth. Among the clinical and serological parameters that have been associated with lymphoma development in SS patients, the presence of palpable purpura, low C4, and mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia constitute the main predictive markers, and patients displaying these risk factors should be monitored closely.",

Likewise, it is debated whether the increased risk identified in association with some disorders pertains equally to all individuals or whether it varies among groups of patients with different phenotypic or treatment-related characteristics. It is similarly unclear to what extent the increased lymphoma occurrence is mediated through specific lymphoma subtypes. This update reviews the many findings on risks, risk levels, and lymphoma characteristics that have been presented recently in relation to a broad range of chronic inflammatory, including autoimmune, conditions. Recent results clearly indicate an association between severity of chronic inflammation and lymphoma risk in RA and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Thus, the average risk of lymphoma in RA may be composed of a markedly increased risk in those with most severe disease and little or no increase in those with mild or moderate disease. The roles of immunosuppressive therapy and EBV infection seem to be limited. Furthermore, RA, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and possibly celiac disease may share an association with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in addition to well-established links of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome with risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and of celiac disease with risk of small intestinal lymphoma.

TYPICAL CLINICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL PRESENTATION: Mucosal involvement (parotid as well as gastric or pulmonary localizations) is frequent. According to the recent classification of lymphomas, most lymphomas developing in patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome are B lymphomas of the marginal zone: MALT lymphomas or low-grade nodal monocytoid lymphomas which are sometimes not identified until transformation to the giant cell stage. SIMILARITIES WITH HEPATITIS C LYMPHOMAS: The pathophysiology of lymphoma in Sj\u00f6gr\u00ebn's syndrome remains unknown. To date, there is no argument favoring a viral infection or a deregulation of a unique oncogene or anti-oncogene. Certain similarities between lymphomas in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and lymphomas associated with hepatitic C virus would suggest a common pathogenisis: possibly a permanent stimulation of auto-reactive B cells carrying a surface immunoglobulin with rheumatoid factor activity in the target organs of the autoimmune disease.

We conducted a retrospective study of 536 consecutive patients followed in our institution to assess the prevalence of hematologic abnormalities and their associations with various disease manifestations in pSS. We also aimed to identify risk factors for the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) overall and by subtype. Anemia of chronic disease and hypergammaglobulinemia were the most prevalent hematologic manifestations encountered at diagnosis and during the course of pSS. Univariate analysis between cytopenias and glandular manifestations revealed a statistically significant correlation between lymphocytopenia and parotid gland enlargement (p = 0.002), as well as between neutropenia and xerostomia (p = 0.019). Anemia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, the presence of monoclonal serum proteins, and cryoglobulinemia correlated significantly with the presence of extraglandular symptoms such as palpable purpura, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Lymphoma was diagnosed in 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4%-10%) of patients. Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCLs) were the predominant histologic type (65%; 95% CI, 48.3%-79.4%), while diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) accounted for 17.5% (95% CI, 7.3%-32.8%) of all cases. The development of NHL in patients with pSS could be predicted by the presence of simple clinical and laboratory factors at diagnosis: neutropenia (p = 0.041), cryoglobulinemia (p = 0.008), splenomegaly (p = 0.006), lymphadenopathy (p = 0.021), and low C4 levels (p = 0.009). Patients carrying any of these factors had a more than 5-fold increased risk of NHL compared to patients with no risk factors at all. The above set of disease characteristics could predict subsequent development of MZBCL; the presence of lymphocytopenia (p = 0.044) at diagnosis served as a risk factor for the development of a non-MZBCL, most commonly DLBCL. Anemia of chronic disease and hypergammaglobulinemia are common hematologic manifestations at diagnosis and during the course of pSS.

Polymorphisms of TNFAIP3, which encodes the A20 protein that plays a key role in controlling nuclear factor \u03baB activation, have been associated with several autoimmune diseases. Somatic mutations of TNFAIP3 have been observed in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma subtype frequently associated with pSS. We studied germline and somatic abnormalities of TNFAIP3 in 574 patients with pSS, including 25 with lymphoma. Nineteen additional patients with pSS and lymphoma were available for exome sequence analysis. Functional abnormalities of A20 were assessed by gene reporter assays. The rs2230926 exonic variant was associated with an increased risk for pSS complicated by lymphoma (odds ratio, 3.36 [95% confidence interval, 1.34-8.42], and odds ratio, 3.26 [95% confidence interval, 1.31-8.12], vs controls and pSS patients without lymphoma, respectively; P = .011). Twelve (60%) of the 20 patients with paired germline and lymphoma TNFAIP3 sequence data had functional abnormalities of A20: 6 in germline DNA, 5 in lymphoma DNA, and 1 in both. The frequency was even higher (77%) among pSS patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Some of these variants showed impaired control of nuclear factor \u03baB activation.

Herein, we tested the hypothesis that MTHFR variants contribute to pSS-related lymphomagenesis. 356 pSS patients, of whom 75 had MALT and 19 non-MALT NHL and 600 healthy controls were genotyped for the detection of MTHFR polymorphisms. DNA methylation levels were assessed by pyrosequencing of the LINE-1 retroelement promoter in DNA from 55 salivary gland tissues from pSS patients.

These structures are characterised by periductal clusters of T and B lymphocytes, development of high endothelial venules and differentiation of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) networks. Evidence in patients with and animal models of SS demonstrated that the formation and maintenance of ELS in the SG is critically dependent on the ectopic expression of lymphotoxins (LT) and lymphoid chemokines CXCL13, CCL19, CCL21 and CXCL12. Several cell types, including resident epithelial, stromal and endothelial cells as well as different subsets of infiltrating immune cells, have been shown to be capable of producing some of these factors during chronic inflammation in SS. In this review we focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of ELS in SS SG, with particular emphasis on the role of lymphoid chemokines. In addition, we summarise accumulating data in support of the notion that ELS in SS represent functional niches whereby autoreactive B cells undergo affinity maturation, clonal selection and differentiation into autoantibody producing cells, thus contributing to autoimmunity over and above secondary lymphoid organs. Furthermore, we review the emerging role of ELS and lymphoid chemokines in driving extranodal B cell lymphomagenesis in SS and we focus on recent evidence suggesting that ELS identify subsets of SS patients at increased risk of developing systemic manifestations and lymphoma.",

Several clinical and serological features are proposed as adverse predictors for such complication and define a high risk pSS phenotype. We aimed to explore whether previously described polymorphisms of the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) could be related to pSS-related lymphomagenesis. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the BAFF gene (rs1224141, rs12583006, rs9514828, rs1041569 and the rs9514827) were evaluated in 111 low risk pSS patients (type II), 82 high risk/lymphoma patients (type I) and 137 healthy controls (HC) by PCR-based assays. The classification of pSS patients into types I and II was based on the presence or absence of risk factors or lymphoma development, respectively. Genotype and haplotype analysis was performed for all variants in the pSS groups. Since the rs1041569 SNP was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the HC group (p &lt; 0.001), haplotype analysis was performed in the remaining four out of the five SNPs tested when comparisons with HC individuals were performed. The high risk pSS group was characterized by higher frequency of the minor T allele of the rs9514828 BAFF polymorphism compared to HC. Compared to the low risk pSS patients but not the HC, the high risk pSS group exhibited lower frequencies of the AA genotype of the rs12583006 polymorphism as well as the TACAC and TACC haplotypes and higher frequency of the TTTC haplotype. The low risk pSS group exhibited higher frequency of the minor A allele and AA genotype of the rs12583006 variant compared to HC. Both pSS groups were characterized by increased frequency of the haplotype TATT and GTTC and decreased frequency of the TTCT when compared to HC. Taken together, these findings suggest the implication of the host's genetic background in pSS-related lymphomagenesis. The interaction of pSS-related BAFF gene haplotypes together with distinct BAFF genetic variants appears to contribute to this complication.",

The estimated prevalence of lymphoma in patients with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome was 5.8%. There were 22 women and 5 men. Histopathologically, 26 of the 27 neoplasms were non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including 6 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, and the other neoplasm was Hodgkin lymphoma. The clinical and imaging findings of lymphomas were analyzed. No obvious correlations were present between the duration or severity of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome and the lymphoma development.

On the other hand, nodal involvement was observed in 21 (78%) of the 27 patients. Of these 21 patients, 19 had at least cervical lymph node involvement. Patients with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome are at increased risk of lymphoma development.

The most common RNA editing modification is the single base substitution (A\u2192I) that is catalyzed by the members of the Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family. Typically, editing sites are identified as RNA-DNA-differences (RDDs) in a comparison of genome and transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing experiments. However, a method for robust detection of site-specific editing events from replicate RNA-seq data has not been published so far. Even more surprising, condition-specific editing events, which would show up as differences in RNA-RNA comparisons (RRDs) and depend on particular cellular states, are rarely discussed in the literature. We present JACUSA, a versatile one-stop solution to detect single nucleotide variant positions from comparing RNA-DNA and/or RNA-RNA sequencing samples. The performance of JACUSA has been carefully evaluated and compared to other variant callers in an in silico benchmark. JACUSA outperforms other algorithms in terms of the F measure, which combines precision and recall, in all benchmark scenarios. This performance margin is highest for the RNA-RNA comparison scenario. We further validated JACUSA's performance by testing its ability to detect A\u2192I events using sequencing data from a human cell culture experiment and publicly available RNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster heads. To this end, we performed whole genome and RNA sequencing of HEK-293 cells on samples with lowered activity of candidate RNA editing enzymes. JACUSA has a higher recall and comparable precision for detecting true editing sites in RDD comparisons of HEK-293 data. Intriguingly, JACUSA captures most A\u2192I events from RRD comparisons of RNA sequencing data derived from Drosophila and HEK-293 data sets. Our software JACUSA detects single nucleotide variants by comparing data from next-generation sequencing experiments (RNA-DNA or RNA-RNA). In practice, JACUSA shows higher recall and comparable precision in detecting A\u2192I sites from RNA-DNA comparisons, while showing higher precision and recall in RNA-RNA comparisons.",

Here we employ an integrative experimental approach focusing on productive and antagonized TSLP complexes and free cytokine. We reveal how cognate receptor TSLPR allosterically activates TSLP to potentiate the recruitment of the shared interleukin 7 receptor \u03b1-chain (IL-7R\u03b1) by leveraging the flexibility, conformational heterogeneity and electrostatics of the cytokine. We further show that the monoclonal antibody Tezepelumab partly exploits these principles to neutralize TSLP activity.

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we compared subcutaneous tezepelumab at three dose levels with placebo over a 52-week treatment period. The primary end point was the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations (events per patient-year) at week 52.

Many donors incur financial expenses due to factors such as lost wages, need for sick days, and travel expenses. Yet, most donors have no regrets about donation. Living kidney donation is practised ethically when informed consent incorporates information about risks, uncertainty about outcomes is acknowledged when it exists, and a donor's risks are proportional to benefits for the donor and recipient. Future research should determine whether outcomes are similar for donors from developing countries and donors with pre-existing conditions such as obesity.",

We determined fetal and maternal outcomes in a large cohort of kidney donors. A total of 2102 women have donated a kidney at our institution; 1589 donors responded to our pregnancy surveys; 1085 reported 3213 pregnancies and 504 reported none. Fetal and maternal outcomes in postdonation pregnancies were comparable to published rates in the general population. Postdonation (vs. predonation) pregnancies were associated with a lower likelihood of full-term deliveries (73.7% vs. 84.6%, p = 0.0004) and a higher likelihood of fetal loss (19.2% vs. 11.3%, p &lt; 0.0001). Postdonation pregnancies were also associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes (2.7% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.0001), gestational hypertension (5.7% vs. 0.6%, p &lt; 0.0001), proteinuria (4.3% vs. 1.1%, p &lt; 0.0001) and preeclampsia (5.5% vs. 0.8%, p &lt; 0.0001). Women who had both pre- and post-donation pregnancies were also more likely to have these adverse maternal outcomes in their postdonation pregnancies.

To address this question, we surveyed 220 women who underwent donor nephrectomy between 1985 and 1992. Of the 144 women who responded, 33 became pregnant after donation for a total of 45 pregnancies. Seventy-five percent of the pregnancies were carried to term without difficulty. Complications incurred during gestation included miscarriage (13.3%), preeclampsia (4.4%), gestational hypertension (4.4%), proteinuria (4.4%), and tubal pregnancy (2.2%). Four of the 45 pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) required preterm hospitalization, resulting in an overall morbidity of 8.8%. There were no pregnancy-related deaths, and no fetal abnormalities were reported. Problems with persistent hypertension, proteinuria, or changes in renal function were not noted. None of the above complications exceeded what has been noted for the general population. Infertility was a problem in 8.3% (3/36) of our respondents, compared with a worldwide incidence of 16.7%. Based on these results, we conclude that donor nephrectomy is not detrimental to the prenatal course or outcome of future pregnancies.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26319389": "Hyperprolactinaemia is one of the most common endocrinological disorder at women at the reproductive age. Prolactin is produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary.The main role of prolactin is associated with mamotrophic action and lactogenesis. Hyperprolactinaemia causes several symptoms such as menstrual disorders, infertility, decrease of sexual function, galactorrhea in women and gynecomasty, impotence and decrease of semen quality in men. Recent studies have presented prolactin as a homone involved in many metabolic processes. Long-term consequences of high prolactin serum concentration are related to higher risk of cardiovascular system disease, disturbances in lipid profile and immunological system. Hyperprolactiaemia causes decrease of bone mass density (BMD). High serum prolactin levels lead to increase of the risk of osteopenia or/and osteoporosis. Decrease of BMD results from hypoestrogenism induced by hyperprolactinaemia and also by the direct negative influence of prolactin on bone. Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures. Important group of patients threatened by osteoporosis and bone fracture is constituted by women which use antipsychotic drugs (which induce hyperprolactinaemia). Hyperprolactinaemia diagnosed in patients should be treated as soon as possible. Hyperprolactinaemic patients should be diagnosed in the direction of osteopenia and osteoporosis. When diagnosis is confirmed proper treatment is indicated.",

Prolactinomas are the most common type of functional pituitary tumor. Effective hyperprolactinemia treatment is of great importance, due to its potential deleterious effects including infertility, gonadal dysfunction and osteoporosis. Dopamine agonist therapy is the first line of treatment for prolactinomas because of its effectiveness in normalizing serum prolactin levels and shrinking tumor size. Though withdrawal of dopamine agonist treatment is safe and may be implemented following certain recommendations, recurrence of disease after cessation of the drug occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. Concerns regarding the safety of dopamine agonists have been raised, but its safety profile remains high, allowing its use during pregnancy. Surgery is typically indicated for patients who are resistant to medical therapy or intolerant of its adverse side effects, or are experiencing progressive tumor growth. Surgical resection can also be considered as a primary treatment for those with smaller focal tumors where a biochemical cure can be expected as an alternative to lifelong dopamine agonist treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery also serves as an option for those refractory to medical and surgical therapy.",

In this review, we highlight signaling pathways involved in lactotrope development, homeostasis, and physiology of pregnancy, as well as implications for signaling pathways in pathophysiology of prolactinoma. We also review mutations found in human prolactinoma and briefly discuss animal models that are useful in studying pituitary adenoma, many of which emphasize the fact that alterations in signaling pathways are common in prolactinomas. Although individual mutations have been proposed as possible driving forces for prolactinoma tumorigenesis in humans, no single mutation has been clinically identified as a causative factor for the majority of prolactinomas.

However, whether patients with various pathological sellar tumors have risk for osteopenia remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to assess the bone mass alteration in patients with various sellar tumors and further to investigate the risk factors of bone mass alteration. 65 premenopausal female patients with diverse sellar tumors and 325 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine and comprehensive endocrinological evaluations were undergone. Compared to the matched controls, BMD of patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma significantly decreased. Patients with sellar meningioma and nonfunctioning adenoma are with a decreasing tendency and patients with growth hormone-secreting adenoma are with an increasing tendency compared to controls. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis indicated that the bone loss in prolactinomas was significantly correlated to disease duration and hypogonadism. In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma. Continuous surveillance of BMD is recommended in patients with meningioma or nonfunctioning adenoma.",

An increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status. Thirty-two males (median age 47 years, range: 22-79) with PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma (10 with microadenoma and 22 with macroadenoma) and 64 control males, with normal PRL values and with comparable age to patients with hyperprolactinemia, were evaluated for vertebral fractures by a morphometric approach and for bone mineral density (BMD) by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine. Vertebral fractures were shown in 12 patients with PRL-secreting adenoma (37.5%) and in 5 controls (7.8%, P &lt; 0.001). Fractured patients had lower BMD T-score (P = 0.007) and longer duration of disease (P &lt; 0.001) as compared to patients who did not fracture. Fractures occurred more frequently (P = 0.03) in patients with untreated hyperprolactinemia versus patients treated with cabergoline whose frequency of vertebral fractures was still higher than control subjects. The prevalence of vertebral fractures was not significantly different between eugonadal and hypogonadal patients (33.3% vs. 38.5%; P = 0.8). Moreover, no significant (P = 0.4) difference in serum testosterone values was found between fractured and not fractured males. Hyperprolactinemia is associated with high prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures in men with PRL-secreting adenoma. These findings would also suggest that PRL excess may produce negative skeletal effects independently of hypogonadism.",

Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction. We describe the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian man who presented with mild anaemia and tiredness. His anaemia was investigated and ascribed to senescence. Endocrine causes were not considered or tested for. Six years later, he was again referred. Reassessment and direct questioning revealed long-standing sexual dysfunction. It was also discovered that our patient had fractured his radius twice, with minor trauma, during the preceding year. His serum prolactin was massively increased and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head demonstrated a pituitary mass consistent with a prolactinoma. Dual X-ray absorptiometry revealed osteoporosis. Treatment of the prolactinoma led to a reduction in his serum prolactin with a rise in his haemoglobin to normal levels. This suggested that the prolactinoma was present during the initial presentation and was the cause of his anaemia. This case highlights the importance of fully evaluating and investigating unexplained anaemia in older people and that endocrine causes should be considered. Osteoporosis also requires evaluation with secondary causes considered.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in 20 white, premenopausal women with prolactinoma and in 60 healthy control white women, using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the os calcis, with an Achilles Lunar Plus device. We measured all three parameters of QUS: broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS) and stiffness. BMD results were expressed also as T- and Z-scores. Age and body mass index (BMI) were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. Comparative analysis showed reduced values of QUS parameters in women with prolactinoma versus controls. Only the difference in SOS parameter was statistically significant between the two studied groups (p = 0.0001). The Z-score was significant lower in women with prolactinoma than in healthy women. These data reveal a significant bone loss in women with prolactinoma compared to controls. The SOS parameter showed a good negative correlation with age, and all the QUS parameters were positively correlated with BMI. The relative risk for developing osteoporosis in women with prolactinoma was found to be 4.5, indicating that hyperprolactinemia in women is a major risk factor for osteoporosis.",

The study was carried out in 75 women (aged 30.53 +/- 7.8): Group I--32 women with prolactinoma and Group II--43 women with functional hyperprolactinaemia. Both groups of patients were subdivided into those with hypogonadism and those with normal gonadal function. The control group consisted of 29 healthy women aged (33.59 +/- 4.7). In all subjects PRL and bone turnover markers (BAP, OC, ICTP) were studied. BMD measurements (lumbar spine, forearm, proximal femur and total body) were carried out using DXA. Higher PRL concentrations were observed in patients than in controls. The values of bone turnover markers (BAP, ICTP) were shown to be higher in patient groups and subgroups than in controls. In patients with prolactinoma lumbar spine BMD was lower than in patients with functional hyperprolactinaemia and controls. Total body BMD was also lower, albeit to a lesser extent. Hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma in women influences bone metabolism unfavourably, more by the impact on the activity of bone turnover markers than on BMD. This provides an opportunity for earlier assessment of bone metabolism disturbances before the BMD changes can be observed. Functional hyperprolactinaemia does not determine such a harmful effect on bone metabolism as hyperprolactinemia due to prolactinoma.",

BMD of lumbar spine and femur was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. PRL, testosterone, estradiol, sexual hormone-binding globulin and free androgen and estrogen indexes (FAI and FEI, respectively) were measured in all the subjects. In patients with prolactinoma, mean values of PRL and testosterone were calculated for the 12-month period that preceded the study. The mean T-score of the four sites analyzed by bone densitometry was lower in men with prolactinoma than in controls (p-values: lumbar spine=0.015, femoral neck &lt;0.0001, trochanter=0.037, total femur=0.036), and 55.6% of the former presented osteopenia or osteoporosis at one or more sites (p =0.035). The lumbar spine was the most seriously affected site, where 29.6% had osteopenia and 14.8% had osteoporosis. By the time of BMD determination, significant associations were found between BMD and PRL, testosterone, FAI, estradiol, FEI, and duration of hypogonadism. Considering the period of 12 months that preceded BMD evaluation, trochanter BMD was associated with mean PRL levels, while there was an association between lumbar spine BMD and mean testosterone levels. However, the multiple regression analysis showed that estradiol was the main determinant of BMD. In conclusion, men with prolactinoma have high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis.

The relative contributions of hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism and the prolactin (PRL) excess per se have been unclear from clinical studies. To determine the effects of PRL excess, two models of chronic hyperprolactinemia were used. In one, mild hyperprolactinemia was produced in rats bearing extra anterior pituitary glands under the kidney capsule. Severe hyperprolactinemia was produced by subcutaneously transplanting the PRL-secreting MMQ tumor into other rats. To control for estrogen deficiency, the rats were ovariectomized. In some experiments, estrogen replacement was provided. Urinary calcium excretion was increased in hyperprolactinemic rats compared with controls, regardless of severity of PRL excess and estrogen status. This suggested that PRL excess itself had some effect on calcium balance. More importantly, however, the spinal bone mineral density (BMD; measured by dual-energy x-ray densitometry) of mildly hyperprolactinemic ovariectomized rats was the same as control ovariectomized rats. Similarly, tibial dry weight and ash weight were affected by the estrogen status, but not by the severe PRL excess of the tumor-implanted rats. Thus, despite the evidence for an increase in urinary calcium excretion in hyperprolactinemic rats, estrogen deficiency is much more important in determining bone mineral. Therefore, the present data indicate that the osteoporosis of hyperprolactinemia is likely due to PRL-induced hypogonadism, rather than a direct effect of PRL on calcium homeostatis.",

In nature, cervids are infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD) prions by oral and nasal mucosal exposure, and studies of early CWD pathogenesis have implicated pharyngeal lymphoid tissue as the earliest sites of prion accumulation. However, knowledge of chronological events in prion spread during early infection remains incomplete. To investigate this knowledge gap in early CWD pathogenesis, we exposed white-tailed deer to CWD prions by mucosal routes and performed serial necropsies to assess PrP<sup>CWD</sup> tissue distribution by real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and tyramide signal amplification immunohistochemistry (TSA-IHC). Although PrP<sup>CWD</sup> was not detected by either method in the initial days (1 and 3) postexposure, we observed PrP<sup>CWD</sup> seeding activity and follicular immunoreactivity in oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues at 1 and 2 months postexposure (MPE). At 3 MPE, PrP<sup>CWD</sup> replication had expanded to all systemic lymphoid tissues. By 4 MPE, the PrP<sup>CWD</sup> burden in all lymphoid tissues had increased and approached levels observed in terminal disease, yet there was no evidence of nervous system invasion. These results indicate the first site of CWD prion entry is in the oropharynx, and the initial phase of prion amplification occurs in the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues followed by rapid dissemination to systemic lymphoid tissues. This lymphoid replication phase appears to precede neuroinvasion.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a universally fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting cervids, and natural infection occurs through oral and nasal mucosal exposure to infectious prions. Terminal disease is characterized by PrP<sup>CWD</sup> accumulation in the brain and lymphoid tissues of affected animals. However, the initial sites of prion accumulation and pathways of prion spread during early CWD infection remain unknown. To investigate the chronological events of early prion pathogenesis, we exposed deer to CWD prions and monitored the tissue distribution of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> over the first 4 months of infection. We show CWD uptake occurs in the oropharynx with initial prion replication in the draining oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues, rapidly followed by dissemination to systemic lymphoid tissues without evidence of neuroinvasion.

Of the known animal prion diseases, only bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions have been shown to be transmissible from animals to humans under non-experimental conditions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects cervids (e.g., deer and elk) in North America and isolated populations in Korea and Europe. Systematic review methodology was used to identify, select, critically appraise and analyse data from relevant research. Studies were evaluated for adherence to good conduct based on their study design following the Cochrane collaboration's approach to grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations (GRADE). Twenty-three studies were included after screening 800 citations from the literature search and evaluating 78 full papers. Studies examined the transmissibility of CWD prions to humans using epidemiological study design, in vitro and in vivo experiments. Five epidemiological studies, two studies on macaques and seven studies on humanized transgenic mice provided no evidence to support the possibility of transmission of CWD prions to humans. Ongoing surveillance in the United States and Canada has not documented CWD transmission to humans. However, two studies on squirrel monkeys provided evidence that transmission of CWD prions resulting in prion disease is possible in these monkeys under experimental conditions and seven in vitro experiments provided evidence that CWD prions can convert human prion protein to a misfolded state. Therefore, future discovery of CWD transmission to humans cannot be entirely ruled out on the basis of current studies, particularly in the light of possible decades-long incubation periods for CWD prions in humans. It would be prudent to continue CWD research and epidemiologic surveillance, exercise caution when handling potentially contaminated material and explore CWD management opportunities.",

PrP<sup>C</sup> is a normal, GPI-anchored protein that is expressed on the surface of neurons and other cell types. The structure of PrP<sup>C</sup> is well understood, based on studies of recombinant PrP, which closely mimics the structure of native PrP<sup>C</sup>. In contrast, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is prone to aggregate into a variety of quaternary structures, such as oligomers, amorphous aggregates, and amyloid fibrils. The propensity of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to assemble into these diverse forms of aggregates is also responsible for our limited knowledge about its structure.

The potential host range for CWD remains uncertain. The susceptibility of the ferret to CWD was examined experimentally by administering infectious brain material by the intracerebral (IC) or oral (PO) route. Between 15 and 20 months after IC inoculation, ferrets developed neurological signs consistent with prion disease, including polyphagia, somnolence, piloerection, lordosis and ataxia. Upon first sub-passage of ferret-adapted CWD, the incubation period decreased to 5 months. Spongiform change in the neuropil was most marked in the basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain and pons. The deposition of PrP(CWD) was granular and was occasionally closely associated with, or localized within, neurons. There were no plaque-like or perivascular PrP aggregates as seen in CWD-infected cervids. In western blots, the PrP(CWD) glycoform profile resembled that of CWD in deer, typified by a dominant diglycosylated glycoform. CWD disease in ferrets followed IC but not PO inoculation, even after 31 months of observation.

In southeastern Wyoming average annual CWD prevalence in mule deer exceeds 20% and appears to contribute to regional population declines. We determined the effect of CWD on mule deer demography using age-specific, female-only, CWD transition matrix models to estimate the population growth rate (\u03bb). Mule deer were captured from 2010-2014 in southern Converse County Wyoming, USA. Captured adult (\u2265 1.5 years old) deer were tested ante-mortem for CWD using tonsil biopsies and monitored using radio telemetry. Mean annual survival rates of CWD-negative and CWD-positive deer were 0.76 and 0.32, respectively. Pregnancy and fawn recruitment were not observed to be influenced by CWD. We estimated \u03bb = 0.79, indicating an annual population decline of 21% under current CWD prevalence levels. A model derived from the demography of only CWD-negative individuals yielded; \u03bb = 1.00, indicating a stable population if CWD were absent. These findings support CWD as a significant contributor to mule deer population decline. Chronic wasting disease is difficult or impossible to eradicate with current tools, given significant environmental contamination, and at present our best recommendation for control of this disease is to minimize spread to new areas and na\u00efve cervid populations.",

To investigate these effects, we tested the null hypothesis that high prevalence CWD did not negatively impact white-tailed deer population sustainability. The specific objectives of the study were to monitor CWD-positive and CWD-negative white-tailed deer in a high-prevalence CWD area longitudinally via radio-telemetry and global positioning system (GPS) collars. For the two populations, we determined the following: a) demographic and disease indices, b) annual survival, and c) finite rate of population growth (\u03bb). The CWD prevalence was higher in females (42%) than males (28.8%) and hunter harvest and clinical CWD were the most frequent causes of mortality, with CWD-positive deer over-represented in harvest and total mortalities. Survival was significantly lower for CWD-positive deer and separately by sex; CWD-positive deer were 4.5 times more likely to die annually than CWD-negative deer while bucks were 1.7 times more likely to die than does. Population \u03bb was 0.896 (0.859-0.980), which indicated a 10.4% annual decline. We show that a chronic disease that becomes endemic in wildlife populations has the potential to be population-limiting and the strong population-level effects of CWD suggest affected populations are not sustainable at high disease prevalence under current harvest levels.",

Since 2002, a number of states and provinces have initiated surveillance programs to detect CWD in native cervid populations. However, many questions remain about the appropriate methods, geographic scope, and number of samples required for an effective CWD surveillance program. We provide an improved statistical method to calculate the probability of detecting CWD in primary sample units (e.g., county or deer management unit) that also considers deer abundance and the nonrandom distribution of CWD and hunter harvests. We used this method to analyze data from a statewide CWD detection program conducted in Wisconsin during the autumns of 2002 and 2003 to determine the distribution of CWD in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Deer heads were collected at hunter registration stations, and brainstem (obex) and retropharyngeal lymph nodes were removed for disease testing. Our analysis includes samples from &gt;35,000 deer collected outside the known affected area. The probability of detecting chronic wasting disease at a prevalence of 1% varied from 0.89 to &gt; or =0.99 among the 56 primary sample units. Detection probabilities for 1% CWD prevalence were &gt;0.9 in 55 primary sample units, and &gt;0.99 in 10. Detection probabilities will be higher in areas where CWD prevalence exceeds 1%. CWD-positive deer were detected in eight primary sample units surrounding the known affected area during surveillance activities. Our approach provides a novel statistical technique to accommodate nonrandom sampling in wildlife disease surveillance programs.",

Examples include kuru, once the leading cause of death among the Fore people in Papua New Guinea and caused by mortuary feasting; bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and its subsequent transmission to humans in the form of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), and repeated examples of large-scale prion disease epidemics in animals caused by contaminated vaccines. The etiology of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a relatively new and burgeoning prion epidemic in deer, elk, and moose (members of the cervid family), is more enigmatic. The disease was first described in captive and later in wild mule deer and subsequently in free-ranging as well as captive Rocky Mountain elk, white-tailed deer, and most recently moose. It is therefore the only recognized prion disorder of both wild and captive animals. In addition to its expanding range of hosts, CWD continues to spread to new geographical areas, including recent cases in Norway. The unparalleled efficiency of the contagious transmission of the disease combined with high densities of deer in certain areas of North America complicates strategies for controlling CWD and raises concerns about its potential spread to new species. Because there is a high prevalence of CWD in deer and elk, which are commonly hunted and consumed by humans, the possibility of zoonotic transmission is particularly concerning. Here, we review the current status of naturally occurring CWD and describe advances in our understanding of its molecular pathogenesis, as shown by studies of CWD prions in novel in vivo and in vitro systems.",

Shedding of infectious prions in saliva and urine is thought to be an important factor in CWD transmission. To help to elucidate this issue, we applied an in vitro amplification assay to determine the onset, duration, and magnitude of prion shedding in longitudinally collected saliva and urine samples from CWD-exposed white-tailed deer. We detected prion shedding as early as 3 months after CWD exposure and sustained shedding throughout the disease course. We estimated that the 50% lethal dose (LD50) for cervidized transgenic mice would be contained in 1 ml of infected deer saliva or 10 ml of urine. Given the average course of infection and daily production of these body fluids, an infected deer would shed thousands of prion infectious doses over the course of CWD infection. The direct and indirect environmental impacts of this magnitude of prion shedding on cervid and noncervid species are surely significant. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging and uniformly fatal prion disease affecting free-ranging deer and elk and is now recognized in 22 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces. It is unique among prion diseases in that it is transmitted naturally through wild populations. A major hypothesis to explain CWD's florid spread is that prions are shed in excreta and transmitted via direct or indirect environmental contact. Here we use a rapid in vitro assay to show that infectious doses of CWD prions are in fact shed throughout the multiyear disease course in deer. This finding is an important advance in assessing the risks posed by shed CWD prions to animals as well as humans.",

Despite the potential threat of CWD to deer populations, little is known about the rates of infection and mortality caused by this disease. We used epidemiological models to estimate the force of infection and disease-associated mortality for white-tailed deer in the Wisconsin and Illinois CWD outbreaks. Models were based on age-prevalence data corrected for bias in aging deer using the tooth wear and replacement method. Both male and female deer in the Illinois outbreak had higher corrected age-specific prevalence with slightly higher female infection than deer in the Wisconsin outbreak. Corrected ages produced more complex models with different infection and mortality parameters than those based on apparent prevalence. We found that adult male deer have a more than threefold higher risk of CWD infection than female deer. Males also had higher disease mortality than female deer. As a result, CWD prevalence was twofold higher in adult males than females. We also evaluated the potential impacts of alternative contact structures on transmission dynamics in Wisconsin deer. Results suggested that transmission of CWD among male deer during the nonbreeding season may be a potential mechanism for producing higher rates of infection and prevalence characteristically found in males. However, alternatives based on high environmental transmission and transmission from females to males during the breeding season may also play a role.",

Projected deer population declines and concern about potential spread of CWD to other species warrant strategies to manage this disease. Control efforts to date have been largely unsuccessful, resulting in continuing spread and increasing prevalence. This systematic review summarizes peer-reviewed published reports describing field-applicable CWD control strategies in wild deer populations in North America using systematic review methods. Ten databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature. Following deduplication, relevance screening, full-text appraisal, subject matter expert review and qualitative data extraction, nine references were included describing four distinct management strategies. Six of the nine studies used predictive modeling to evaluate control strategies. All six demonstrated one or more interventions to be effective but results were dependant on parameters and assumptions used in the model. Three found preferential removal of CWD infected deer to be effective in reducing CWD prevalence; one model evaluated a test and slaughter strategy, the other selective removal of infected deer by predators and the third evaluated increased harvest of the sex with highest prevalence (males). Three models evaluated non-selective harvest of deer. There were only three reports that examined primary data collected as part of observational studies. Two of these studies supported the effectiveness of intensive non-selective culling; the third study did not find a difference between areas that were subjected to culling and those that were not. Seven of the nine studies were conducted in the United States. This review highlights the paucity of evaluated, field-applicable control strategies for CWD in wild deer populations. Knowledge gaps in the complex epidemiology of CWD and the intricacies inherent to prion diseases currently pose significant challenges to effective control of this disease in wild deer in North America.",

Because it is uniformly fatal, the disease is a major concern in the management of white-tailed deer populations. Management programs to control CWD require improved knowledge of deer interaction, movement, and population connectivity that could influence disease transmission and spread. Genetic methods were employed to evaluate connectivity among populations in the CWD management zone of southern Wisconsin. A 576-base-pair region of the mitochondrial DNA of 359 white-tailed deer from 12 sample populations was analyzed. Fifty-eight variable sites were detected within the sequence, defining 43 haplotypes. While most sample populations displayed similar levels of haplotype diversity, individual haplotypes were clustered on the landscape. Spatial clusters of different haplotypes were apparent in distinct ecoregions surrounding CWD outbreak areas. The spatial distribution of mtDNA haplotypes suggests that clustering of the deer matrilineal groups and population connectivity are associated with broad-scale geographic landscape features. These landscape characteristics may also influence the contact rates between groups and therefore the potential spread of CWD; this may be especially true of local disease spread between female social groups. Our results suggest that optimal CWD management needs to be tailored to fit gender-specific dispersal behaviors and regional differences in deer population connectivity. This information will help wildlife managers design surveillance and monitoring efforts based on population interactions and potential deer movement among CWD-affected and unaffected areas.",

The disease is a unique member of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases, which naturally affect only a few species. Of the TSEs, CWD is the only one found in free-ranging species. However, interest in CWD has recently grown, by association with the better-known TSEs such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Knowledge of the geographic distribution of CWD, though still limited, has greatly improved since the mid-1990s as a result of surveillance in free-ranging deer and elk and in commercially owned Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and the disease has now been found in multiple areas of the plains and Rocky Mountain foothills of western North America. Studies of the biology and natural history of CWD over recent years have resulted in a better understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease. Early involvement of the lymphoid tissues of the alimentary tract during the incubation period of CWD suggests plausible routes for agent exit from an infected individual, such as in faeces or saliva. Chronic wasting disease is laterally transmitted and environmental contamination may play an important role in local maintenance of the disease. Studies on the epidemiology of CWD have led to the development of models to help explain the history of CWD and to simulate future impacts on deer and elk populations. Diagnostic tests have been improved, allowing diagnosis early in the incubation period, long before the appearance of clinical disease. Surveillance techniques and programmes have been developed and instituted by wildlife management agencies for free-ranging deer and elk and by state and federal agricultural agencies for privately-owned elk. During the 1990s, perceptions of TSEs have altered dramatically; perhaps most remarkably, the goal of global eradication of all prion diseases is now being discussed.",

We characterized the spatial distribution of CWD in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Wisconsin to facilitate CWD management. We found that CWD prevalence declined with distance from a central location, was locally correlated at a scale of 3.6 km, and was correlated with deer habitat abundance. The latter result is consistent with patterns expected for a positive relationship between density and prevalence of CWD. We recommend management activities focused on culling in geographic areas with high prevalence to have the greatest probability of removing infected individuals. Further research is needed to elucidate the factors involved in CWD spread and infection rates, especially the role of density-dependent transmission.",

We developed seven competing models, and then used data from two CWD outbreaks in captive mule deer and model selection to compare them. We found that models portraying indirect transmission through the environment had 3.8 times more support in the data than models representing transmission by direct contact between infected and susceptible deer.

The natural history of CWD is incompletely understood, but it differs from scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) by virtue of its occurrence in nondomestic and free-ranging species. CWD has many features in common with scrapie, including early widespread distribution of disease-associated prion protein (PrP(d)) in lymphoid tissues, with later involvement of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. This distribution likely contributes to apparent efficiency of horizontal transmission and, in this, is similar to scrapie and differs from BSE. Clinical features and lesions of CWD are qualitatively similar to the other animal TSEs. Microscopically, marked spongiform lesions occur in the central nervous system (CNS) after a prolonged incubation period and variable course of clinical disease. During incubation, PrP(d) can be identified in tissues by antibody-based detection systems. Although CWD can be transmitted by intracerebral inoculation to cattle, sheep, and goats, ongoing studies have not demonstrated that domestic livestock are susceptible via oral exposure, the presumed natural route of exposure to TSEs. Surveillance efforts for CWD in captive and free-ranging cervids will continue in concert with similar activities for scrapie and BSE.

CWD is the only recognized transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting free-ranging species. Three cervid species, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), are the only known natural hosts of CWD. Endemic CWD is well established in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, and has been present in this 'core area' for two decades or more. Apparently CWD has also infected farmed cervids in numerous jurisdictions, and has probably been endemic in North America's farmed deer and elk for well over a decade. Several free-ranging foci distant to the Colorado-Wyoming core area have been discovered since 2000, and new or intensified surveillance may well identify even more foci of infection. Whether all of the identified captive and free-ranging foci are connected via a common original exposure source remains undetermined. Some of this recently observed 'spread' may be attributable to improved detection or natural movements of infected deer and elk, but more distant range extensions are more likely caused by movements of infected captive deer and elk in commerce, or by some yet unidentified exposure risk factor. Research on CWD over the last 5 years has resulted in a more complete understanding of its pathogenesis and epidemiology. CWD is infectious, transmitting horizontally from infected to susceptible cervids. Early accumulation of PrP(CWD) in alimentary tract-associated lymphoid tissues during incubation suggests agent shedding in feces or saliva as plausible transmission routes. Residual infectivity in contaminated environments also appears to be important in sustaining epidemics. Improved tests allow CWD to be reliably diagnosed long before clinical signs appear. Implications of CWD are not entirely clear at this time. Natural transmission to humans or traditional domestic livestock seems relatively unlikely, but the possibility still evokes public concerns; impacts on wildlife resources have not been determined. Consequently, where CWD is not known to occur surveillance programs and regulations that prevent or reduce the likelihood that CWD will be introduced into these jurisdictions should be encouraged. Where CWD is known to occur, affected jurisdictions are conducting surveillance to estimate and monitor trends in geographic distribution and prevalence, managing deer and elk populations in attempts to limit spread, and developing and evaluating techniques for further controlling and perhaps eradicating CWD. Programs for addressing the challenges of CWD management will require interagency cooperation, commitment of funds and personnel, and applied research. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is perhaps the most enigmatic of the naturally occurring prion diseases. Although recognized as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) since the late 1970s (Williams and Young 1980, 1982), interest in and concern about CWD has only recently emerged. CWD most closely resembles scrapie in sheep in most respects, but recent media and public reaction to CWD has been more reminiscent of that afforded to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) less than a decade ago. Yet, with the exception of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), CWD is the rarest of the known animal TSEs: fewer than 1,000 cases have been diagnosed worldwide, and all but two of these occurred in North America. CWD is unique among the TSEs in that it affects free-living species (Spraker et al. 1997; Miller et al. 2000). The three natural host species for CWD, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), are all in the family Cervidae and native to North America. Like scrapie, CWD is contagious: epidemics are self-sustaining in both captive and free-ranging cervid populations (Miller et al. 1998, 2000). The geographic extent of endemic CWD in free-ranging wildlife was initially thought to be quite limited and its natural rate of expansion slow; however, recent investigations have revealed that CWD has been inadvertently spread much more widely via market-driven movements of infected, farmed elk and deer. Both the ecological and economic consequences of CWD and its spread remain to be determined; moreover, public health implications remain a question of intense interest. Here, we review current understanding of CWD, its implications, and its management.",

In this paper we report the development of a sensing system for measuring GA by combining an enzyme analysis method, which is already used in clinical practice, with electrochemical principles. We used fructosyl amino acid oxidase, hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride as the electron mediator, and an inexpensive and economically attractive screen-printed carbon electrode. We used chronoamperometry to measure protease-digested GA samples. The developed sensor strips were able to measure protease-digested samples containing GA in very small sample volumes (1.3\u03bcL) within about 1min. We also prepared enzyme sensor strips suitable for clinical use in which the enzyme and the mediator were deposited and dried on. This sensor system showed a clear correlation between the GA concentration and the resulting current. The strips were stable following 3 months of storage at 37\u00b0C.

In the present study we explored the extent to which A1c accurately represents glycemic control, as measured by MPG, for individual patients. Data were pooled from randomized clinical trials in which A1c and self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles were collected by patients with Type 2 diabetes treated with insulin analog regimens.

The goal of this study is to determine if the level of hemoglobin A1c has any effect on disease severity in diabetic patients with limb threatening ischemia. A retrospective review of all patients presenting with limb threatening ischemia between January 1 and December 31, 2007 was conducted. All patients underwent conventional arteriography prior to intervention. Of 148 patients, 73 were diabetics with a hemoglobin A1c level performed within 3 mo of presentation. Patients were placed into high (&gt;7) and low (&lt;7) hemoglobin A1c groups and data was collected on type of presentation, comorbidities, anatomic level of disease, tibial artery patency, need for amputation, contralateral disease, need for an open versus an endovascular procedure, and freedom from intervention. Fisher's exact t-test was used to compare the two groups. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Thirty-six patients had HbA1c levels above 7.0 and 37 had levels below 7.0 (mean 7.64 \u00b1 2.04, range 5.1-14.7). There were no statistically significant differences in the two groups in comorbities, average age, initial gangrene at presentation, aspirin or statin use, or smoking status.

In addition, TASC II classifications of iliac and femoral popliteal disease was similar between the two groups. Freedom from intervention is depicted graphically by life table analysis. Glucose control measured by hemoglobin A1c does not appear to affect severity of disease or need for reintervention in diabetics with limb threatening ischemia. This suggests other factors related to diabetes may play a role in peripheral vascular disease.

Of 3075 persons (aged 70-79 yr, 48% men, 42% Black) at study entry, 1865 participants without known diabetes who had appropriate measures were included. Sensitivity and specificity of A1c-based diagnoses were compared with those based on FPG and the proportion of participants identified with dysglycemia by each measure. Of all participants, 2.7 and 3.1% had undiagnosed diabetes by FPG\u2265126 mg/dl and A1c\u22656.5%, respectively. Among the remaining participants, 21.1% had prediabetes by impaired fasting glucose (\u2265100 mg/dl) and 22.2% by A1c\u22655.7%. Roughly one third of individuals with diabetes and prediabetes were identified by either FPG or A1c alone and by both tests simultaneously. Sensitivities and specificities of A1c compared with FPG were 56.9 and 98.4% for diabetes and 47.0 and 84.5% for prediabetes, respectively. Blacks and women were more likely to be identified with dysglycemia by A1c than FPG. In this older population, we found considerable discordance between FPG- and A1c-based diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes, with differences accentuated by race and gender. Broad implementation of A1c to diagnose dysglycemic states may substantially alter the epidemiology of these conditions in older Americans.",

Barriers to diabetes adherence (BDA) items were generated by researchers, clinicians, and patients. Adolescents aged 12-17 with T1D completed the BDA and an adherence measure. Hemoglobin A1C was obtained through medical chart review. Factor analysis from 123 adolescents resulted in a 21-item, five-component solution that accounted for 64.5% of the variance. The components were stress and burnout, time pressure and planning, social support, parental autonomy support, and stigma. The BDA total and subscales were internally consistent. The BDA total and some components were associated with adherence and A1C. The BDA was the only predictor of A1C compared to demographic, clinical, and adherence variables (F 6.17, p&lt;.05). Subjects with higher A1C (&gt;8.5) showed a higher level of barriers (F 15.20, p&lt;.001) and a differential profile of barriers (F 5.75, p&lt;.05). The BDA may be useful in research and clinical settings as a compliment to adherence measures and to tailor educational programs.

Quality measures that reliably predict health outcomes are required. To compare the ability of alternative wait time measures to predict glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels among diabetes patients. This retrospective observational study relied on Veterans Health Administration utilization data and Medicare claims data from 2005 to 2010. Outcomes included an average A1C level and uncontrolled A1C. Heckman selection models simultaneously predicted the presence of an A1C value and its level. Models were risk adjusted for prior individual health status. The main explanatory variables of interest were facility-level primary care wait times measured in days. Several measures were tested, including capacity measures and retrospective and prospective time stamp measures. The time stamp measures used either the date the appointment was created in the scheduling system (create date) or the date the patient or provider desired the appointment (desired date) as the start date for wait time computation. All measures were calculated separately for new and returning patients. New patient capacity and create date measures significantly predicted outcomes, but desired date measures did not. The returning patient retrospective create date and desired date wait time measures significantly predicted higher and uncontrolled A1C, but capacity and prospective create date measures did not. Different administrative wait times predict A1C for new and returning patients. To properly measure quality, ACOs should use wait time measures that demonstrate relationships with outcomes for subpopulations of patients.",

We aimed to produce measures of quality of diabetes care in Saskatchewan and to identify sub-groups at particular risk of developing complications. Prevalent adult cases of diabetes in 2005/06 were identified from administrative databases and linked with A1C and LDL-C tests measured in centralized laboratories. A1C results were performed in 33,927 of 50,713 (66.9%) diabetes cases identified in Saskatchewan, and LDL-C results were performed in 12,031 of 24,207 (49.7%) cases identified within the province's two largest health regions. The target A1C of &lt;= 7.0% and the target LDL-C of &lt;2.5 mmol/L were achieved in 48.3% and 45.1% of diabetes cases respectively. The proportions were lower among those who were female, First Nations, non-urban, younger and in lower income quintiles. The same groups experienced poorer glycemic control (exception females), and poorer lipid control (exception First Nations people). Among non-Aboriginal people, younger diabetic females were least likely to receive lipid lowering agents. Linkage of laboratory with administrative data is an effective method of assessing quality of diabetes care on a population basis and to identify sub-groups requiring particular attention. We found that less than 50% of Saskatchewan people with diabetes achieved optimal glycemic and lipid control. Disparities were most evident among First Nations people and young women. The indicators described can be used to provide standardized information that would support quality improvement initiatives.",

Historically, dichotomous thresholds have been set for intermediate outcomes such as A1C (in this case, &gt; 9%) on the basis of levels associated with high risk, that is, thresholds for what would be considered poor control for all persons. Dichotomous threshold measures may not accurately reflect the true impact of care on population health because absolute risk reduction for micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes is not linear but rather log-linear, with greater impact of a given improvement on patients with worse rather than better glycemic control. Also, an \"all or none\" measure for all patients set at \"optimal\" control may unfairly evaluate physician/health care performance. A continuous measure of A1C, as the cornerstone in quality assessment for diabetes, can incorporate each of the Institute of Medicine's (IOM)'s quality domains: effectiveness and equity, patient safety, patient-centered care, timeliness, and efficiency. A continuous measure of A1C can better capture than a dichotomous measure the complexity of glycemic control at a population level.",

Glycated haemoglobin, as measured by haemoglobin A1C (A1C), can potentially identify pregnant women at high risk for adverse outcomes associated with GDM including macrosomia and post-partum glucose intolerance. Our objective was to systematically review the literature with respect to A1C levels during pregnancy and associated maternal and offspring outcomes. We used MEDLINE to identify relevant publications from 1975 to 2009. We included articles if they met the following criteria: original full text articles in English; primary exposure of antepartum A1C; women with GDM at baseline or who developed GDM during the study; primary outcome of GDM, insulin use, post-partum abnormal glucose or type 2 diabetes (T2DM), birthweight, macrosomia or large for gestational age. Case series and case reports were excluded. Twenty studies met our criteria. A1C at GDM diagnosis was positively associated with post-partum abnormal glucose. Women with post-partum T2DM or impaired glucose tolerance had mean A1C at GDM diagnosis higher than those with normal post-partum glucose (P \u2264 0.002) and a 1% increase in A1C at GDM diagnosis was associated with 2.36 times higher odds of post-partum abnormal glucose 6 weeks after delivery [95% confidence interval 1.19, 4.68]. The association of A1C and birthweight varied substantially between studies, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.11 to 0.51. A1C, a less burdensome and costly measure than an oral glucose tolerance test, appears to be an attractive measure for identifying women at high risk of adverse outcomes associated with GDM.",

In this review, we discuss the methods to measure A1c and the corresponding conditions that can affect the clinical utility of the test. Conditions that affect the A1c can be either those that impair erythrocyte production or alter the normal process of glycation.

However, A1C outcomes are not meaningful when taken outside of the context of hypoglycemia risks. Current regulatory guidance indicates that A1C efficacy end points and hypoglycemia safety end points be considered separately.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15644138": " It has been established that careful diabetes self-management is essential in avoiding chronic complications that compromise health. Disciplined diet control and regular exercise are the keys for the type 2 diabetes self-management. An ability to maintain one's blood glucose at a relatively flat level, not fluctuating wildly with meals and hypoglycemic medical intervention, would be the goal for self-management. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c or simply A1c) is a measure of a long-term blood plasma glucose average, a reliable index to reflect one's diabetic condition. A simple regimen that could reduce the elevated A1c levels without altering much of type 2 diabetic patients' daily routine denotes a successful self-management strategy. A relatively simple model that relates the food impact on blood glucose excursions for type 2 diabetes was studied. Meal is treated as a bolus injection of glucose. Medical intervention of hypoglycaemic drug or injection, if any, is lumped with secreted insulin as a damping factor. Lunch was used for test meals. The recovery period of a blood glucose excursion returning to the pre-prandial level, the maximal reach, and the area under the excursion curve were used to characterize one's ability to regulate glucose metabolism. A case study is presented here to illustrate the possibility of devising an individual-based self-management regimen. Results of the lunch study for a type 2 diabetic subject indicate that the recovery time of the post-prandial blood glucose level can be adjusted to 4 hours, which is comparable to the typical time interval for non-diabetics: 3 to 4 hours. A moderate lifestyle adjustment of light supper coupled with morning swimming of 20 laps in a 25 m pool for 40 minutes enabled the subject to reduce his A1c level from 6.7 to 6.0 in six months and to maintain this level for the subsequent six months. The preliminary result of this case study is encouraging. An individual life-style adjustment can be structured from the extracted characteristics of the post-prandial blood glucose excursions. Additional studies are certainly required to draw general applicable guidelines for lifestyle adjustments of type 2 diabetic patients.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342823": "Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, is caused by increased dose of genes present on human chromosome 21 (HSA21). The gene-dose hypothesis argues that a change in the dose of individual genes or regulatory sequences on HSA21 is necessary for creating DS-related phenotypes, including cognitive impairment. We focused on a possible role for Kcnj6, the gene encoding Kir3.2 (Girk2) subunits of a G-protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel. This gene resides on a segment of mouse Chromosome 16 that is present in one extra copy in the genome of the Ts65Dn mouse, a well-studied genetic model of DS. Kir3.2 subunit-containing potassium channels serve as effectors for a number of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors including GABAB receptors. Several studies raise the possibility that increased Kcnj6 dose contributes to synaptic and cognitive abnormalities in DS. To assess directly a role for Kcnj6 gene dose in cognitive deficits in DS, we produced Ts65Dn mice that harbor only 2 copies of Kcnj6 (Ts65Dn:Kcnj6++- mice). The reduction in Kcnj6 gene dose restored to normal the hippocampal level of Kir3.2. Long-term memory, examined in the novel object recognition test with the retention period of 24h, was improved to the level observed in the normosomic littermate control mice (2N:Kcnj6++). Significantly, both short-term and long-term potentiation (STP and LTP) was improved to control levels in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the Ts65Dn:Kcnj6++- mouse. In view of the ability of fluoxetine to suppress Kir3.2 channels, we asked if fluoxetine-treated DG slices of Ts65Dn:Kcnj6+++ mice would rescue synaptic plasticity. Fluoxetine increased STP and LTP to control levels. These results are evidence that increased Kcnj6 gene dose is necessary for synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Strategies aimed at pharmacologically reducing channel function should be explored for enhancing cognition in DS.",

Ts65Dn mice and disomic (2N) littermates sacrificed at ages 6-8 and 14-18 mos were used for an aging study and Ts65Dn and 2N mice derived from Ts65Dn dams were maintained on either a choline-supplemented or a choline-controlled diet (conception to weaning) and examined at 14-18 mos for MCS studies. In the latter, mice were behaviorally tested on the radial arm Morris water maze (RAWM) and hippocampal tissue was examined for intensity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity. Hippocampal ChAT activity was evaluated in a separate cohort. ChAT-positive fiber innervation was significantly higher in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus in Ts65Dn mice compared with 2N mice, independent of age or maternal diet. Similarly, hippocampal ChAT activity was significantly elevated in Ts65Dn mice compared to 2N mice, independent of maternal diet. A significant increase with age was seen in hippocampal cholinergic innervation of 2N mice, but not Ts65Dn mice. Degree of ChAT intensity correlated negatively with spatial memory ability in unsupplemented 2N and Ts65Dn mice, but positively in MCS 2N mice. The increased innervation produced by MCS appears to improve hippocampal function, making this a therapy that may be exploited for future translational approaches in human DS.",

Autoradiograms of quantitative Southern blots of DNAs from two affected sisters, their carrier father, and a normal control were analyzed after hybridization with two to six unique DNA sequences regionally mapped on chromosome 21. These include cDNA probes for the genes for CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mapping in 21q22.1 and for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) mapping in 21q11.2-21.05, in addition to six probes for single-copy sequences: D21S46 in 21q11.2-21.05, D21S47 and SF57 in 21q22.1-22.3, and D21S39, D21S42, and D21S43 in 21q22.3.

To explore the functional role of DSCR1 and the regulation of its expression, we searched for novel DSCR1-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Using a human fetal brain library, we found that DSCR1 interacts with NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NIK specifically interacts with and phosphorylates the C-terminal region of DSCR1 in immortalized hippocampal cells as well as in primary cortical neurons. This NIK-mediated phosphorylation of DSCR1 increases its protein stability and blocks its proteasomal degradation, the effects of which lead to an increase in soluble and insoluble DSCR1 levels. We show that an increase in insoluble DSCR1 levels results in the formation of cytosolic aggregates.

We detected subtle changes with the Tc1/Ms2Yah mice performing better than the Tc1 individuals in the reversal paradigm of the Morris water maze. We also found that Tc1/Ms2Yah compound mutants performed better in the rotarod than the Tc1 mice. This data support the impact of genes from the Abcg1-U2af1 region as modifiers of Tc1-dependent memory and locomotor phenotypes. Our results emphasize the complex interactions between triplicated genes inducing DS features.",

We have devised a method termed the homologous gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HGQ-PCR), which uses one pair of primers and which can directly identify the additional copy of chromosome 21 by simultaneously amplifying two highly homologous genes of the human liver-type phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 21 (PFKL-CH21) and the human muscle-type phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 1 (PFKM-CH1) for self-detecting determination. On analysis of 34 cases of Down's syndrome, including two cases of unbalanced translocation 46, XY, der (14; 21) (q10; q10), + 21, and 100 normal individuals, the relative ratio of the PFKM-CH1/PFKL-CH21 product was 1.33 +/- 0.323 (mean +/- SD) and 0.40 +/- 0.16 (mean +/- SD) for disomy DNA and trisomy DNA, respectively. The difference between these two groups was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001).

Ts21 is the most frequent cause of congenital heart defects and the leading genetic cause of mental retardation. To investigate the gene dosage effects of an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (Chr 21) on various phenotypes, we used microcell-mediated chromosome transfer to create embryonic stem (ES) cells containing Chr 21. ES cell lines retaining Chr 21 as an independent chromosome were used to produce chimeric mice with a substantial contribution from Chr 21-containing cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR-based DNA analysis revealed that Chr 21 was substationally intact but had sustained a small deletion. The freely segregating Chr 21 was lost during development in some tissues, resulting in a panel of chimeric mice with various mosaicism as regards retention of the Chr 21. These chimeric mice showed a high correlation between retention of Chr 21 in the brain and impairment in learning or emotional behavior by open-field, contextual fear conditioning and forced swim tests. Hypoplastic thymus and cardiac defects, i.e. double outlet right ventricle and riding aorta, were observed in a considerable number of chimeric mouse fetuses with a high contribution of Chr 21. These chimeric mice mimic a wide variety of phenotypic traits of DS, revealing the utility of mice containing Chr 21 as unique models for DS and for the identification of genes responsible for DS.",

There is epidemiologic evidence that individuals with Down syndrome are at decreased risk for solid tumors including brain tumors. It has been suggested that some genes expressed on the extra copy of chromosome 21 act as tumor suppressor genes and contribute to protection against tumorigenesis. We report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with Down syndrome, an 8-year-old boy, with an intracranial meningioma, in which the status of chromosome 21 was examined. The diagnosis was based on histologic examination of the surgically resected tumor. Postoperatively, the patient's neurologic status improved, and there was no tumor regrowth in the next 2 years. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosome 22 confirmed high allele loss involving the neurofibromin 2 gene locus, a finding typical in meningiomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization also revealed chromosome 21 heterogeneity in tumor cells; not only cells with trisomy 21 but also cells with disomy and monosomy 21 were present. All blood cells from the patient manifested trisomy 21. Deletion of the chromosome 21 allele may be associated with tumorigenesis of meningioma in Down syndrome. This supports the hypothesis that some genes whose expression is increased on the extra copy of chromosome 21 function as tumor suppressor genes and that they contribute to the reduced tumor incidence in individuals with Down syndrome.",

Langdon Down published a paper on \"an ethnic classification of idiots\" and noted their facial resemblance with individuals of the Mongolian people. In 1959, J. Lejeune, M. Gautier, and R.

There is now a debate within the medical literature on the age of trisomy 21 as a disease affecting mankind. Since it was not described before 1866, some authors questioned whether this disease is an old or new condition in humans. Three methods of investigation are useful for demonstrating that trisomy 21 has been present in humans for a long time: the figuration of this condition in historical paintings, figurines, and pottery; its presence in old skeletal remains; and the origin of human chromosome 21 during primate phylogeny. Figurines strongly suggestive of trisomy 21 have been found in the Greco-Roman world, in many Central and South American pre-Columbian cultures, and in Khmer temples. In Europe, during the Renaissance, Italian and Flemish artists represented trisomy 21 in paintings of religious inspiration.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26300975": " Trisomy 21 Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause for congenital malformations and intellectual disability. It is well known that in the outstanding majority of cases the extra chromosome 21 originates from the mother but only in less than 10 % from the father. The mechanism underlying this striking difference in parental origin of Trisomy 21 Down syndrome is still unknown. However, it seems likely that the main reason is a much higher stringency in the elimination of any trisomy 21 cells during fetal testicular than ovarian development. We have here focussed attention on the paternal gametic output, i.e. the incidence of disomy 21 in spermatozoa. We have used fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to determine the copy number of chromosome 21 in spermatozoa from 11 men with normal spermiograms. Due to the well-known risk of false positive and false negative signals using a single FISH probe, we have applied two chromosome 21q probes, and we have added a chromosome 18-specific probe to allow differentiation between disomy 21 and diploidy. Analysing a total number of 2000 spermatozoa per case, we documented an average incidence of disomy 21 at 0.13 %, with a range of 0.00-0.25 % and a SD of 0.08. There was no indication of diploidy in this cohort of 22,000 sperm. Numerous previous studies on the incidence of disomy 21 in sperm have been published, using FISH. As far as we are aware, none of these have applied more than a single chromosome 21-specific probe. Accepting our mean of 0.13 % of disomy 21, and providing there is no selective fertilisation capability of disomy 21 sperm in relation to the normal, we conclude that around 1 in 800 conceptions is expected to be trisomic for chromosome 21 of paternal origin. Bearing in mind that the maternal origin likely is at least 10 times more common, we tentatively propose that around 1 in 80 oocytes in the maternal ovarian reserve may be disomy 21. One reason for this discrepancy may be a more stringent selection against aberrant chromosome numbers during spermatogenesis than oogenesis. Further work is required to determine the relevant stages of spermatogenesis at which such a selection may take place.",

It is well known that the extra chromosome 21 most often originates from the mother, the incidence increases with maternal age, there may be aberrant maternal chromosome 21 recombination and there is a higher recurrence in young women. In spite of intensive efforts to understand the underlying reason(s) for these characteristics, the origin still remains unknown. We hypothesize that maternal trisomy 21 ovarian mosaicism might provide the major causative factor. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with two chromosome 21-specific probes to determine the copy number of chromosome 21 in ovarian cells from eight female foetuses at gestational age 14-22 weeks. All eight phenotypically normal female foetuses were found to be mosaics, containing ovarian cells with an extra chromosome 21. Trisomy 21 occurred with about the same frequency in cells that had entered meiosis as in pre-meiotic and ovarian mesenchymal stroma cells. We suggest that most normal female foetuses are trisomy 21 ovarian mosaics and the maternal age effect is caused by differential selection of these cells during foetal and postnatal development until ovulation. The exceptional occurrence of high-grade ovarian mosaicism may explain why some women have a child with Down syndrome already at young age as well as the associated increased incidence at subsequent conceptions. We also propose that our findings may explain the aberrant maternal recombination patterns previously found by family linkage analysis.",

In a prospective study regional cerebral blood flow studies were carried out with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in seven children with craniosynostoses. Five preoperative and six postoperative studies were conducted and the results correlated with radiological and surgical findings. Preoperative studies revealed regional hypovascularity in the underlying cerebral hemisphere, corresponding to the fused sutures. Postoperative studies revealed disappearance of these perfusion defects in most cases, indicating normalization of perfusion following surgical decompression.

Mutations in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor-2 comprise the majority of known mutations in syndromic forms of craniosynostosis. A number of clinical reports of FGFR-associated craniosynostosis patients and mouse mutants have been linked to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders, leading to the hypothesis of a direct link between FGFR-associated craniosynostosis syndromes and GIT malformations. We conducted an investigation to determine GIT symptoms in a sample of FGFR-associated craniosynostosis syndrome patients and a mouse model of CS containing a mutation (W290R) in Fgfr2. We found that, compared to the general population, the incidence of intestinal/bowel malrotation (IM) was present at a higher level in our sample population of patients with FGFR-associated craniosynostosis syndromes. We also showed that the mouse model of CS had an increased incidence of cecal displacement, suggestive of IM. These findings suggest a direct relationship between FGFR-related craniosynostosis syndromes and GIT malformations. Our study may shed further light on the potential widespread impact FGFR mutations on different developmental systems.

The associated of FGFR3 mutations with craniosynostosis has been restricted to three mutations, the common p.Pro250Arg in Muenke syndrome, p.Ala391Glu in Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, and p.Pro250Leu identified in a family with isolated craniosynostosis. Other FGFR3 mutations result in various skeletal dysplasias: achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia. Here, we report a novel mutation in exon 8 (IIIc) of FGFR3, p.Ala334Thr, in a young boy with mild craniosynostosis. The mutation segregated with mild craniosynostosis in the family and was absent in 188 normal controls. Alanine 334 is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates and is located at the amino terminus of the \u03b2F loop in the FGFR3c isoform.

Although much of the genetics and phenotypes in craniosynostosis syndromes is understood, less is known about the underlying ossification mechanism during suture closure. We have previously demonstrated that physiological closure of the posterior frontal suture occurs through endochondral ossification. Moreover, we revealed that antagonizing canonical Wnt-signaling in the sagittal suture leads to endochondral ossification of the suture mesenchyme and sagittal synostosis, presumably by inhibiting Twist1. Classic Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is characterized by coronal synostosis, and the haploinsufficient Twist1(+/-) mice represents a suitable model for studying this syndrome. Thus, we seeked to understand the underlying ossification process in coronal craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice. Our data indicate that coronal suture closure in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs between postnatal day 9 and 13 by endochondral ossification, as shown by histology, gene expression analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, this study reveals that coronal craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs through endochondral ossification.

Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Antley-Bixler syndrome are related to mutations in FGFR family (especially in FGFR2), and mutations in FGFRs can be overlapped between different syndromes. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Muenke syndrome, and craniofrontonasal syndrome are representative disorders showing isolated coronal suture involvement. Compared to the other types of craniosynostosis, single gene mutations can be more frequently detected, in one-third of coronal synostosis patients. Molecular diagnosis can be helpful to provide adequate genetic counseling and guidance for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.",

Raman microspectroscopy was used to examine the composition, relative amounts, and locations of the mineral and matrix produced in mouse skulls undergoing force-induced craniosynostosis. Raman imaging revealed decreased relative mineral content in skulls undergoing craniosynostosis compared with unloaded specimens. Raman microspectroscopy, a nondestructive vibrational spectroscopic technique, was used to examine the composition, relative amounts, and locations of the mineral and matrix produced in mouse skulls undergoing force-induced craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis, premature fusion of the skull bones at the sutures, is the second most common birth defect in the face and skull. The calvaria, or flat bones that comprise the top of the skull, are most often affected, and craniosynostosis is a feature of over 100 human syndromes and conditions. Raman images of the suture, the tips immediately adjacent to the suture (osteogenic fronts), and mature parietal bones of loaded and unloaded calvaria were acquired. Images were acquired at 2.6 x 2.6 microm spatial resolution and ranged in a field of view from 180 x 210 microm to 180 x 325 microm. This study found that osteogenic fronts subjected to uniaxial compression had decreased relative mineral content compared with unloaded osteogenic fronts, presumably because of new and incomplete mineral deposition. Increased matrix production in osteogenic fronts undergoing craniosynostosis was observed. Understanding how force affects the composition, relative amounts, and location of the mineral and matrix provides insight into musculoskeletal disease in general and craniosynostosis in particular. This is the first report in which Raman microspectroscopy was used to study musculoskeletal disease. These data show how Raman microspectroscopy can be used to study subtle changes that occur in disease.",

While genomic assays can identify putative enhancers en masse, assigning target genes is a complex challenge. We devised a machine learning approach, McEnhancer, which links target genes to putative enhancers via a semi-supervised learning algorithm that predicts gene expression patterns based on enriched sequence features. Predicted expression patterns were 73-98% accurate, predicted assignments showed strong Hi-C interaction enrichment, enhancer-associated histone modifications were evident, and known functional motifs were recovered. Our model provides a general framework to link globally identified enhancers to targets and contributes to deciphering the regulatory genome.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28366801": "The redox state of cysteine thiols is critical for protein function. Whereas cysteines play an important role in the maintenance of protein structure through the formation of internal disulfides, their nucleophilic thiol groups can become oxidatively modified in response to diverse redox challenges and thereby function in signalling and antioxidant defences. These oxidative modifications occur in response to a range of agents and stimuli, and can lead to the existence of multiple redox states for a given protein. To assess the role(s) of a protein in redox signalling and antioxidant defence, it is thus vital to be able to assess which of the multiple thiol redox states are present and to investigate how these alter under different conditions. While this can be done by a range of mass spectrometric-based methods, these are time-consuming, costly, and best suited to study abundant proteins or to perform an unbiased proteomic screen. One approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Redox-modified cysteine residues are selectively tagged with a large group, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, and then the proteins are separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, which allows the inference of redox changes based on band shifts. However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents. To establish a more robust method for redox-selective PEGylation, we have utilised a Click chemistry approach, where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently Click-reacted with a PEG molecule containing a complementary azide function. This strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines. Separation of the thiol labelling step from the PEG conjugation greatly facilitates the fidelity and flexibility of this approach. Here we show how the Click-PEGylation technique can be used to interrogate the redox state of proteins.",

The expression of mTOR, Becline-1, LC3 and p62 was detected by RT-PCR in 81 SLE subjects and 86 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Data regarding demographics and clinical parameters were collected. Disease activity of SLE was evaluated according to the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score. Independent sample t-test was used to analyze the expression of mTOR, Becline-1, LC3, and p62 in the two groups. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation was performed to analyze their relationship with disease activity and immunologic features. The mean levels of Becline-1, LC3 and p62 mRNA were significantly higher in SLE patients than the controls (9.96\u00d710<sup>-4</sup> vs 7.38\u00d710<sup>-4</sup> for Becline-1 with <i>P</i>&lt;0.001; 4.04\u00d710<sup>-5</sup> vs 2.62\u00d710<sup>-5</sup> for LC3 with <i>P</i>&lt;0.001; 9.51\u00d710<sup>-4</sup> vs 7.59\u00d710<sup>-4</sup> for p62 with <i>P</i>=0.008). However, the levels of mTOR mRNA in SLE patients were not significantly different from that in controls. Correlation analysis showed that Becline-1, LC3 and p62 mRNA levels correlated positively with SLEDAI, IgG and ds-DNA, negatively with C3. Our results suggested that autophagosomes formation were activated and their degradation were blocked in SLE. Moreover, the maintenance of autophagy balance can improve disease activity and immune disorders in SLE patients.",

In addition, we determined the level of systemic involvement throughout the course of the disease. Blood levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to parvovirus B19, levels of anti-dsDNA, C3, and C4 were measured. A PCR real-time assay was used to determine the presence of parvovirus B19 genetic material. The viral genome was found in sera of 2 of 51(3.9%) patients with SLE. There was no correlation between viral serology and the clinical and serological parameters of the disease. More SLE patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had IgG and IgM antibodies to the virus (p &lt; 0.029 and p &lt; 0.018, respectively). These patients also had a higher titer of IgG antibodies to parvovirus B19 compared to SLE patients without APS. In this group of SLE patients, no association was found between parvovirus infection and the presence or activity of SLE. The results of the study suggest an association between parvovirus infection and antibody production directed against phospholipids.",

SLEDAI scores decreased significantly over time from diagnosis. Within 3 months after disease onset, 54% of patients reached their maximum SLEDAI scores. There were no differences in clinical features or survival between these patients and those with later (mean, 35 months) maximum disease activity, although the latter had more frequent disease flares. Overall survival was poor (91% and 56% at 1 and 5 years, respectively). High persistent disease activity (weighted average of SLEDAI scores &gt; 10) was independently associated with decreased survival, whereas a high initial SLEDAI, a high maximum SLEDAI, and an increase number of flares were not. The main cause of death was infection, which often was associated with active disease (mean SLEDAI at death, 16 +/- 8.9).

DV and other clinical manifestations defined according to the SLEDAI were evaluated in 168 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Two groups were defined according to presence (DV+, n = 27) or absence of DV (DV-, n = 141) at the time of evaluation. The exclusion criterion was the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (Sapporo's criteria). The two groups were comparable with regard to age (P = 0.09), gender (P = 1.00), white race (P = 0.81), and disease duration (P = 0.78). Compared to the DV- group, the DV+ group had a significantly higher frequency of mucocutaneous manifestations (66.7 vs. 39.0%, P = 0.01), haematological abnormalities (22.2 vs. 6.4%, P = 0.02) and constitutional symptoms (11.1 vs. 0.7%, P = 0.01). Renal and neurological involvements were similar in both groups (P = 0.57 and P = 1.00, respectively). The evaluation of each SLEDAI parameter confirmed that the DV+ group had higher frequencies of mild manifestations, such as new rash (P = 0.02), alopecia (P = 0.02), oral ulcers (P = 0.045), fever (P = 0.01) and leucopenia (P = 0.005). In contrast, both groups had similarly increased anti-dsDNA (P = 0.78) and decreased complement levels (P = 0.29). In conclusion, DV in patients with SLE identifies a subgroup of a mild disease. The high 'weighted' index attributed to this alteration in the SLEDAI score should therefore be revised.",

In total, 230 patients with SLE followed at the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic who had 5 visits 3 months apart in 1992-93 were studied. At each visit a standard protocol was completed. A clinician who did not know the patients or their SLEDAI scores evaluated each patient record and assigned a clinical activity level. \"Flare\" was defined by new or increased therapy for active disease, an expression of concern, or use of the term \"flare\" in the physician's notes. The SLEDAI score was calculated from the database. SLEDAI scores described a range of clinical activity as recognized by the clinician. Median SLEDAI scores ranged from 2 (inactive disease) to 8 (persistently active or flare). When the clinician assessed the patient to be improved, the median SLEDAI score decreased by 2. When the clinician assessed that the patient was experiencing a flare, the SLEDAI score increased by a median of 4. Based on our data we propose the following outcomes for patients with SLE: flare, an increase in SLEDAI &gt; 3; improvement is a reduction in SLEDAI of &gt; 3; persistently active disease is change in SLEDAI +/- 3; and remission a SLEDAI of 0. These outcomes will allow a more complete description of a patient's response to therapeutic intervention in a responder index.",

There are various clinical and laboratory methods to assess the lupus flares. Fifty one SLE patients with active disease (lupus flare) were studied. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI), C3, C4 and anti-double stranded DNA levels were estimated and repeated monthly till remission. After remission these tests were done three monthly. Values of serological parameters were then correlated with SLEDAI score. Thirteen (25.4%) patients had predominantly renal involvement while 38 (74.6%) patients had non-renal affliction. Musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous symptoms were the commonest features of lupus flare (90%). It was observed that 12 out of 13 (92.3%) patients with active renal involvement had low C3 levels and 11 (84.6%) had low C4 levels. The anti-dsDNA levels were elevated in all patients with predominant renal flare. In non-renal flare anti-dsDNA titre was raised only in 35% cases. Low C3 and C4 levels were noticed in 43% and 53% of non-renal flares respectively. Significant positive correlation was noticed between SLEDAI score and anti-dsDNA levels (0.01 level two-tailed prediction) and a significant negative correlation was observed with SLEDAI and C3, C4 levels (0.01 and 0.05 levels, two-tailed prediction) in our patients. On subgroup analysis it was noticed that this correlation is stronger for renal lupus. Negative correlation of SLEDAI and complement levels was not observed in non-renal flares. Calculation of SLEDAI is a vital clinical tool for assessment of SLE patients. Serial estimation of anti-dsDNA titre, C3 and C4 levels help us diagnose lupus flare and make appropriate therapeutic decisions in patients with high SLEDAI score.",

For headaches to be scored in the SLEDAI as a symptom of active disease, they have to be nonresponsive to narcotic analgesia. This may affect the overall estimation of disease activity, especially because headaches are common among children with SLE and narcotic analgesia is rarely used for headache therapy in paediatrics. Moreover, the importance of headaches for the development of damage and their relation to other clinical parameters and outcomes has not been well described for children with SLE. We reviewed the medical charts of an inception cohort of children (n = 63) who were newly diagnosed with SLE. Information on headaches and other disease parameters was obtained. Disease activity and damage were measured using the SLEDAI and the Systemic Lupus International Collaboration Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI), respectively. It has been shown that the accumulated burden of active disease as measured by serial SLEDAI scores over time is one of the best predictors of eventual damage to children with SLE. New-onset or significant increase of severe and/or persistent headaches (LHA) were reported in 43% of the patients during a mean follow-up of 3.6 years. LHA occurred preferentially among patients with elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) (P &lt; 0.02) and only 6% of all LHA episodes were treated with narcotics and thus considered for the measurement of disease activity in the SLEDAI. LHA were unrelated to proxy-measures of disease activity, such as the need to intensify therapies. When used in children, the insensitivity of the SLEDAI to capture LHA did not seem to decrease the responsiveness of the SLEDAI to detect clinically important worsening of disease, or negatively impact on its ability to predict damage.",

Lupus Foundation of America (LFA)-Rapid Evaluation of Activity in Lupus (REAL) is a pilot application composed of anchored visual analogue scores (0-100 mm each) for each organ affected by lupus. This study evaluated the use of LFA-REAL in capturing SLE disease activity. In a preliminary test of LFA-REAL, this simplified, organ-based system was compared with the most widely used outcome measures in clinical trials, the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 Index (BILAG), the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) SLEDAI Physician's Global Assessment (SS-PGA). The level of agreement was analysed using Spearman rank correlations. 91 patients with SLE with mild to severe disease activity were evaluated, their median SLEDAI score was 4.0 (range 0-28) and BILAG score 8.0 (0-32). The median SS-PGA was 38 mm (4-92) versus the total REAL 50 mm (0-268), which expands in range by additive organ scores. Thirty-three patients had moderate to severe disease activity (\u22651.5 on SS-PGA landmarks). The median SS-PGA score of this group was 66 mm (50-92) versus median REAL score of 100 mm (59-268), confirming ability to detect a wider distribution of scores at higher disease activity. Total REAL correlated with SLEDAI, BILAG and SS-PGA (correlation coefficient=0.816, 0.933 and 0.903, respectively; p&lt;0.001 for all). Individual LFA-REAL organ scores for musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous also correlated with corresponding BILAG domain scores (correlation coefficient=0.925 and 0.934, p&lt;0.001).

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 45 SLE patients (88% female; mean age: 31.2 \u00b1 8.2 years) from 2011 to 2013 in Mashhad, Iran. The patients had no clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac problems or risk factors for cardiovascular disease and were selected consecutively. All patients underwent complete echocardiographic examinations (using two dimensional (2D) tissue Doppler and 2D speckle tracking). Disease activity was evaluated by using the SLEDAI. Patients with higher SLEDAI scores had higher pulmonary artery pressure rates (r = 0.34; P = 0.024; 95% CI (0.086 to 0.595)) and SLE durations (r = 0.43; P = 0.004; 95% CI (0.165 to 0.664).

There were no significant differences among the groups during the trial in global or maximum disease activity, incidence or probability of flares, or medication use. The median time to the first flare was three months in all groups. Thromboses occurred in four patients (two in each of the two groups receiving hormones), and severe infections were more frequent in the IUD group. One patient receiving combined oral contraceptives died from amoxicillin-related severe neutropenia. Global disease activity, maximum SLEDAI score, incidence of flares, time to first flare, and incidence of adverse events were similar among women with systemic lupus erythematosus, irrespective of the type of contraceptive they were using.",

However, more study of their responsiveness is needed. The purpose of this study was to compare the responsiveness of SLAM-R and SLEDAI to disease activity changes relevant to physicians and patients. Patients were evaluated monthly for up to 12 months. At each visit, the physician completed SLAM-R and SLEDAI. Patients and physicians assessed whether relevant improvement or worsening of disease activity had occurred since the previous visit. Based on repeated measurements, effect size (ES), standardized response mean (SRM), and control-standardized response mean (CSRM) were calculated for each response category, with bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seventy-six patients contributed 471 score changes. For physicians' responses, the CSRMs for SLAM-R and SLEDAI were -0.47 versus -0.42 for improvement, 0.04 versus 0.003 for no change, and 0.65 versus 0.66 for deterioration. For patients, the CSRMs for SLAM-R and SLEDAI were -0.31 versus -0.18 for improvement, -0.08 versus 0.06 for no change, and 0.48 versus 0.05 for deterioration. Only for SLAM-R did the 95% CIs exclude zero when improvement or deterioration were detected. Similar results were found for ES and SRM. Both SLAM-R and SLEDAI are responsive to changes in SLE disease activity important to physicians. Only SLAM-R is responsive to changes important to patients. These differences may result from the inclusion of subjective SLE manifestations in SLAM-R.",

The objective was to measure urinary CXCL10 in SLE patients, to compare levels between nephritis and non-nephritis groups and to study its correlation with other variables. Sixty lupus patients were enrolled in our trial. Thirty patients had lupus nephritis and the other 30 were without evidence of lupus nephritis. Thirty healthy subjects were willing to participate as a healthy control group. Renal biopsy was performed for lupus nephritis group. Urinary CXCL10 was measured using the ELISA technique. Serum creatinine, C3, C4 and 24 h urinary proteins were measured. Lupus activity was assessed using systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scoring system. Renal activity was measured using renal activity scoring system. CXCL10 was significantly higher in lupus nephritis patients than in lupus patients without nephritis.

A high urine cytology score has been reported to be associated with lupus nephritis in relapse. The objective of this study was to examine the urinary mononuclear cell population of patients with lupus nephritis, and explore its correlation with lupus disease activity. We studied 12 patients with active lupus nephritis, 17 patients with lupus nephritis in remission, 12 SLE patients with no history of renal disease and 13 healthy subjects. Clinical disease activity was quantified by the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Mononuclear cell species in the urinary sediment were examined by immunocytochemistry. Patients with active lupus nephritis had significantly more mononuclear cells in the urinary sediment. The number of CD3+ cell was significantly elevated in the active lupus nephritis than the others (P &lt; 0.001), while there was no significant difference in the number of CD20+ and CD56+ cell among patient groups. The total urinary mononuclear cell correlated significantly with the overall SLEDAI score (r = 0.58, P &lt; 0.001) as well as the renal score (r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.001). The number of urinary CD3+, but not CD20+ or CD56+, cell significantly correlated with the overall SLEDAI score (r = 0.46, P = 0.003) as well as the renal score (r = 0.40, p = 0.011). In nine patients with renal biopsy, the histological activity index correlated with the total urinary mononuclear cell (r = 0.75, P = 0.02), CD3+ (r = 0.69, P = 0.04) and CD20+ cell (r = 0.69, P = 0.04). We conclude that urinary mononuclear cell was markedly elevated in patients with active lupus, and the urinary mononuclear cell count correlated significantly with the SLEDAI score and histological activity.

Initial biopsy showed EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement. She received cisplatin-gemcitabine, followed by 17 months of gemcitabine. Owing to progression, she received erlotinib for 14 months, then paclitaxel for 6 months and finally crizotinib. A partial response was achieved and maintained for 24 months. A 45-year-old Caucasian woman, light smoker, was diagnosed with cT2N3M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Only EGFR mutation was found on initial analysis. She underwent treatment with cisplatin-gemcitabine and thoracic radiotherapy. Progression occurred after 8 months and afatinbib was started. Eight months later, progression was observed with a neoplasic pleural effusion in which tumor cells expressing ALK rearrangement were found. A new FISH analysis was performed on the initial tumor but did not find this rearrangement. Despite a third line of crizotinib, the patient died one month later. The literature shows 45 other cases of these two abnormalities, observed either from the start or during follow-up. EGFR's TKI were almost always given before ALK's TKI.

As systemic therapies improve, patients with lung cancer live longer and thus are at increased risk for brain metastases. Understanding how prognosis varies across this heterogeneous patient population is essential to individualize care and design future clinical trials. To update the current Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. The DS-GPA is based on data from patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2005, and we set out to update it by incorporating more recently reported gene and molecular alteration data for patients with NSCLC and brain metastases. This new index is called the Lung-molGPA. This is a multi-institutional retrospective database analysis of 2186 patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2014 with NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases. The multivariable analyses took place between December 2015 and May 2016, and all prognostic factors were weighted for significance by hazard ratios. Significant factors were included in the updated Lung-molGPA prognostic index. The main outcome was survival. Multiple Cox regression was used to select and weight prognostic factors in proportion to their hazard ratios. Log rank tests were used to compare adjacent classes and to compare overall survival for adenocarcinoma vs nonadenocarcinoma groups. The original DS-GPA was based on 4 factors found in 1833 patients with NSCLC and brain metastases diagnosed between 1985 and 2005: patient age, Karnofsky Performance Status, extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases. The patients studied for the creation of the DS-GPA had a median survival of 7 months from the time of initial treatment of brain metastases. To design the updated Lung-molGPA, we analyzed data from 2186 patients from 2006 through 2014 with NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases (1521 adenocarcinoma and 665 nonadenocarcinoma). Significant prognostic factors included the original 4 factors used in the DS-GPA index plus 2 new factors: EGFR and ALK alterations in patients with adenocarcinoma (mutation status was not routinely tested for nonadenocarcinoma). The overall median survival for the cohort in the present study was 12 months, and those with NSCLC-adenocarcinoma and Lung-molGPA scores of 3.5 to 4.0 had a median survival of nearly 4 years.

Prognosis of advanced neuroblastoma is still poor despite the recent advances in chemo/radiotherapies. In view of improving the clinical outcome of advanced neuroblastoma, it is important to identify the key molecules responsible for the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma and to develop effective drugs that target these molecules. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, initially identified through the analysis of a specific translocation associated with a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently it was demonstrated that ALK is frequently mutated in sporadic cases with advanced neuroblastoma. Moreover, germline mutations of ALK were shown to be responsible for the majority of hereditary neuroblastoma. ALK mutants found in neuroblastoma show constitutive active kinase activity and oncogenic potentials. Inhibition of ALK in neuroblastoma cell lines carrying amplified or mutated ALK alleles results in compromised downstream signaling and cell growth, indicating potential roles of small molecule ALK inhibitors in the therapeutics of neuroblastoma carrying mutated ALK kinases.",

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogating ALK activity are currently in clinical use for the treatment of ALK-positive (ALK(+)) disease, monotherapy with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors may not be an adequate solution for ALK(+) neuroblastoma patients. Increased expression of the gene encoding the transcription factor MYCN is common in neuroblastomas and correlates with poor prognosis. We found that the kinase ERK5 [also known as big mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1 (BMK1)] is activated by ALK through a pathway mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, MAPK kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3), and MAPK kinase 5 (MEK5). ALK-induced transcription of MYCN and stimulation of cell proliferation required ERK5. Pharmacological or RNA interference-mediated inhibition of ERK5 suppressed the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells in culture and enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the ALK inhibitor crizotinib in both cells and xenograft models. Together, our results indicate that ERK5 mediates ALK-induced transcription of MYCN and proliferation of neuroblastoma, suggesting that targeting both ERK5 and ALK may be beneficial in neuroblastoma patients.",

In contrast, ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK TKI) crizotinib has shown superior effects in combating NSCLCs with EML4-ALK. Thus, characterization of EML4-ALK fusion genes and clinical features of resulting carcinomas would be a great benefit to disease diagnosis and designing customized treatment plans.

However, it is not clear whether this is the case in male patients, too. In this study, we have determined the frequency of EML4-ALK translocation in male never-smokers with NSCLC in a cohort of Chinese patients. The clinical features associated with EML4-ALK translocation were also investigated. A cohort of 95 Chinese male never-smokers with NSCLC was enrolled in this study. EML4-ALK fusion genes were detected using one-step real time RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. We further determined the expression levels of ALK mRNA by RT-PCR and ALK protein by immunohistochemistry in these specimens.

Therefore, there is a need to better understand the role of ALK in cancer biology in order to optimise treatment strategies. This review summarises the latest research on the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, and how this information can guide the management of patients with cancer that is ALK-positive. A variety of ALK gene alterations have been described across a range of tumour types, including point mutations, deletions and rearrangements. A wide variety of ALK fusions, in which the kinase domain of ALK and the amino-terminal portion of various protein partners are fused, occur in cancer, with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK being the most prevalent in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Different ALK fusion proteins can mediate different signalling outputs, depending on properties such as subcellular localisation and protein stability. The ALK fusions found in tumours lack spatial and temporal regulation, which can also affect dimerisation and substrate specificity. Two ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib and ceritinib, are currently approved in Europe for use in ALK-positive NSCLC and several others are in development. These ALK TKIs bind slightly differently within the ATP-binding pocket of the ALK kinase domain and are associated with the emergence of different resistance mutation patterns during therapy. This emphasises the need to tailor the sequence of ALK TKIs according to the ALK signature of each patient. Research into the oncogenic functions of ALK, and fast paced development of ALK inhibitors, has substantially improved outcomes for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Limited data are available surrounding the physiological ligand-stimulated activation of ALK signalling and further research is needed.

Three of four patients with ALK/EGFR co-alterations treated with an EGFR TKI achieved one or more responses in different lines of therapy: four patients had a partial response, three with afatinib and one with osimertinib. One patient achieved a complete remission with osimertinib, and one patient was primary refractory to erlotinib. Median PFS during treatment with a first EGFR TKI was 5.8 months (range 3.0-6.9 months). De novo concurrent ALK/KRAS co-alterations were associated with resistance to ALK TKI treatment in seven out of eight patients. In patients with ALK/EGFR co-alterations, outcomes with ALK and EGFR TKIs seem inferior to what would be expected in patients with either alteration alone, but further studies are needed to clarify which patients with ALK/EGFR co-alterations may still benefit from the respective TKI.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17611412": "ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The native ALK protein is normally expressed in the developing and, at a weaker level, adult nervous system. We recently demonstrated that ALK is a novel dependence receptor. As such, in the absence of ligand, the ALK receptor is kinase inactive and its expression results in enhanced apoptosis, whereas kinase activation, due to a ligand or constitutive as in NPM-ALK, decreases apoptosis. Unligated/kinase unactivated ALK receptor facilitates apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the exposure of a proapoptotic juxta-membrane intra-cellular domain. This review summarizes the biological significance of the ALK receptor in cancer and development, in perspective with its dependence receptor function. The dual function of ALK in the physiology of development is illustrated in the visual system of Drosophila. In this part of the nervous system, ALK in the presence of ligand appears essential for axonal guidance, whereas in the absence of ligand, ALK expression can lead to developmental neuronal apoptosis. ALK is also found expressed in neural crest-derived tumors such as human neuroblastomas or glioblastomas but its role is not fully elucidated. However, an excessive or constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activation can lead to deregulation of cell proliferation and survival, therefore to human cancers such as lymphomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Our observations could have important implications in the therapy of ALK-positive tumors harboring the chimeric or wild type ALK protein.",

However, the benefit of sequential treatment with a 2nd ALK-TKI in patients who fail a 1st ALK-TKI has been poorly addressed. We collected the data of 69 advanced ALK-positive NSCLCs who were treated with one or more ALK-TKIs at three Italian institutions. The clinical outcome of treatment with an ALK-TKI and the patterns of treatment upon failing a 1st ALK-TKI were recorded. Objective response rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (PFS) on a 1st ALK-TKI (mostly crizotinib) were 60.9% and 12 months, respectively. Of the 50 patients who progressed on a 1st ALK-TKI, 22 were further treated with a 2nd ALK-TKI (either ceritinib or alectinib), for whom an ORR of 86.4% and median PFS of 7 months, respectively, were reported. Conversely, 13 patients underwent rapid clinical/radiographic disease progression leading to death shortly after discontinuation of the 1st ALK-TKI, 7 patients were managed with a 1st ALK-TKI beyond progression, and 8 patients transitioned to other systemic treatments (mostly chemotherapy). Post-progression survival (PPS) significantly favored the 22 patients who were sequentially treated with a 2nd ALK-TKI over those who transitioned to other systemic treatments (P=0.03), but not versus those who were treated with a 1st ALK-TKI beyond progression (P=0.89). Sequential treatment with a 2nd ALK-TKI is effective in patients who fail a 1st ALK-TKI. Continuous ALK-inhibition upon failing a 1st ALK-TKI may be associated with improved clinical outcome.",

Genomic alterations in ALK, including rearrangements, point mutations, and genomic amplification, have now been identified in several malignancies, including lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), neuroblastoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and others. Importantly, ALK serves as a validated therapeutic target in these diseases. Several ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib, have been developed, and some of them have already been approved for clinical use. These ALK inhibitors have all shown remarkable clinical outcomes in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

About 80% of ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cases are characterized by the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, encoding for the aberrant fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, whereas 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carry the inv(2)(p21;p23) rearrangement, encoding for the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion. The ALK/c-MET/ROS inhibitor crizotinib successfully improved the treatment of ALK-driven diseases. However, several cases of resistance appeared in NSCLC patients, and ALK amino acid substitutions were identified as a leading cause of resistance to crizotinib. Second-generation ALK inhibitors have been developed in order to overcome crizotinib resistance. In this work, we profiled in vitro the activity of crizotinib, AP26113, ASP3026, alectinib, and ceritinib against six mutated forms of ALK associated with clinical resistance to crizotinib (C1156Y, L1196M, L1152R, G1202R, G1269A, and S1206Y) and provide a classification of mutants according to their level of sensitivity/resistance to the drugs. Since the biological activity of ALK mutations extends beyond the specific type of fusion, both NPM-ALK- and EML4-ALK-positive cellular models were used. Our data revealed that most mutants may be targeted by using different inhibitors. One relevant exception is represented by the G1202R substitution, which was highly resistant to all drugs (&gt;10-fold increased IC50 compared to wild type) and may represent the most challenging mutation to overcome. These results provide a prediction of cross-resistance of known crizotinib-resistant mutations against all second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) clinically available, and therefore could be a useful tool to help clinicians in the management of crizotinib-resistance cases.",

Visual disorder is one of the popular adverse events of crizotinib, but the symptom almost decreases over time. We report a case of orbital metastasis as the disease progression of ALK-positive lung cancer treated with crizotinib. It should be kept in mind that orbital metastasis can be the disease progression of lung adenocarcinoma with ALK translocation treated with crizotinib.

These ALK gene rearrangements are present in 3-5 % of NSCLC patients, typically younger, never or light smokers with adenocarcinomas. Crizotinib is a first-in-class ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity in ALK-positive NSCLC that received accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC in 2011, just 4 years after identification of ALK rearrangements in this setting. Subsequently, two phase III trials have shown crizotinib to have a tolerable toxicity profile and to be superior to standard chemotherapy for the first- or second-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive lung cancer and numerous countries have approved its use. Despite initial responses, acquired resistance to crizotinib invariably leads to disease progression. Mechanisms of resistance have been described to include ALK tyrosine kinase mutations, activation of bypass signalling pathways and pharmacokinetic failure of crizotinib. Several next-generation ALK inhibitors, including ceritinib and alectinib, are in clinical development and show efficacy in both the crizotinib na\u00efve and crizotinib refractory settings. Ongoing clinical trials will identify the optimal strategy to incorporate these novel agents in the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.",

The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement identifies a population of NSCLCs in whom dysregulation of ALK-tyrosine kinase (-TK) leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, thus providing the basis for the therapeutic use of ALK-TK inhibitors (-TKIs) in ALK-rearranged (-positive) disease. Crizotinib was the first ALK-TKI to undergo clinical development in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, in which it has been shown to greatly outperform the best available chemotherapy regimen in either second- or first-line setting. More recently, the novel second-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib has been shown to be highly active in either crizotinib-pretreated or -na\u00efve population. Nevertheless, as mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib and ALK-TKIs in general are being progressively elucidated, the treatment landscape of ALK-positive NSCLC is expected to evolve rapidly. In the present review we will briefly discuss the current knowledge of ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) essentially and transiently expressed during development of the central and peripheral nervous systems. ALK has been identified as a major neuroblastoma predisposition gene and activating mutations have been identified in a subset of sporadic neuroblastoma tumors. We previously established that the mutated receptors were essentially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartments due to their constitutive activity. Intriguingly we demonstrated a stronger phosphorylation for the minor pool of receptor addressed to the plasma membrane. We decided to investigate the potential involvement of tyrosine phosphatase in dephosphorylation of this intracellular pool. In this study we first showed that general inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases resulted in a dramatic increase of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the wild type but also of the mutated receptors. This increase not only required the intrinsic kinase activity of the ALK receptor but also involved the Src tyrosine kinase family. Second we provided strong evidences that the endoplasmic reticulum associated phosphatase PTP1B is key player in the control of ALK phosphorylation. Our data shed a new light on the biological significance of the basal phosphorylation levels of both wild type and mutated ALK receptors and could be essential to further understand their roles in malignancies.",

High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease.",

These translocations generate fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK) with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, which activate numerous signalling pathways important for ALK+ ALCL pathogenesis. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) plays a critical role in allowing NPM-ALK and other signalling proteins to function in this lymphoma. Co-chaperone proteins are important for helping Hsp90 fold proteins and for directing Hsp90 to specific clients; however the importance of co-chaperone proteins in ALK+ ALCL has not been investigated. Our preliminary findings suggested that expression of the immunophilin co-chaperone, Cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), is up-regulated in ALK+ ALCL by JunB, a transcription factor activated by NPM-ALK signalling. In this study we examined the regulation of the immunophilin family of co-chaperones by NPM-ALK and JunB, and investigated whether the immunophilin co-chaperones promote the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines. NPM-ALK and JunB were knocked-down in ALK+ ALCL cell lines with siRNA, and the effect on the expression of the three immunophilin co-chaperones: Cyp40, FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 51, and FKBP52 examined. Furthermore, the effect of knock-down of the immunophilin co-chaperones, either individually or in combination, on the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines and NPM-ALK levels and activity was also examined. We found that NPM-ALK promoted the transcription of Cyp40 and FKBP52, but only Cyp40 transcription was promoted by JunB. We also observed reduced viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA, but not with siRNAs directed against FKBP52 or FKBP51. Finally, we demonstrate that the decrease in the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA does not appear to be due to a decrease in NPM-ALK levels or the ability of this oncoprotein to signal. This is the first study demonstrating that the expression of immunophilin family co-chaperones is promoted by an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Moreover, this is the first report establishing an important role for Cyp40 in lymphoma.",

Dimerization of the ALK kinase domain leads to its autophosphorylation and constitutive activation. Activated NPM/ALK stimulates downstream survival and proliferation signaling pathways leading to malignant transformation. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of autoactivation of the catalytic domain of ALK. Because kinases are typically regulated by autophosphorylation of their activation loops, we systematically mutated (Tyr --&gt; Phe) three potential autophosphorylation sites contained in the \"YXXXYY\" motif of the ALK activation loop, and determined the effect of these mutations on the catalytic activity and biological function of NPM/ALK. We observed that mutation of both the second and third tyrosine residues (YFF mutant) did not affect the kinase activity or transforming ability of NPM/ALK. In contrast, mutation of the first and second (FFY), first and third (FYF), or all three (FFF) tyrosine residues impaired both kinase activity and transforming ability of NPM/ALK. Furthermore, a DFF mutant, in which the aspartic residue introduces a negative charge similar to a phosphorylated tyrosine, possessed catalytic activity similar to the YFF mutant. Together, our findings indicate that phosphorylation of the first tyrosine of the YXXXYY motif is necessary for the autoactivation of the ALK kinase domain and the transforming activity of NPM/ALK.",

Therefore, we investigated if the ALK gene is mutated in medulloblastoma and performed simultaneously the molecular profiling of tumours. Tumours from sixty-four medulloblastoma patients were studied for detection of ALK alterations in exons 23 and 25 using Sanger method. The molecular subtypes of tumours were identified by detection of mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, monosomy 6 and by immunohistochemistry using a panel of representative antibodies. Among three ALK variants detected two resulted in intron variants (rs3738867, rs113866835) and the third one was a novel heterozygous variant c.3595A&gt;T in exon 23 identified in the WNT type of tumour. It resulted in methionine to leucine substitution at codon position 1199 (M1199L) of the kinase domain of ALK protein. Results of analysis using three in silico algorithms confirmed the pathogenicity of this single nucleotide variation. The same gene alteration was detected in both patient and maternal peripheral blood leukocytes indicating an inherited type of the detected variant. Presence of ALK expression in tumour tissue was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The tumour was diagnosed as classic medulloblastoma, however with visible areas of focal anaplastic features. The patient has been disease free for 6 years since diagnosis. This is the first evidence of an inherited ALK variant in the WNT type of medulloblastoma, what altogether with presence of ALK expression may point towards involvement of the ALK gene in this type of tumours.",

Included in these genetic alterations are mutations in the kinase domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which have been found in both somatic and familial neuroblastoma. In order to treat patients accordingly requires characterisation of these mutations in terms of their response to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Here, we report the identification and characterisation of two novel neuroblastoma ALK mutations (A1099T and R1464STOP), which we have investigated together with several previously reported but uncharacterised ALK mutations (T1087I, D1091N, T1151M, M1166R, F1174I and A1234T). In order to understand the potential role of these ALK mutations in neuroblastoma progression, we have employed cell culture-based systems together with the model organism Drosophila as a readout for ligand-independent activity. Mutation of ALK at position 1174 (F1174I) generates a gain-of-function receptor capable of activating intracellular targets such as ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in a ligand-independent manner. Analysis of these previously uncharacterised ALK mutants and comparison with ALK(F1174) mutants suggests that ALK mutations observed in neuroblastoma fall into three classes. These classes are: (i) gain-of-function ligand-independent mutations such as ALK(F1174l), (ii) kinase-dead ALK mutants, e.g. ALK(I1250T) (Sch\u00f6nherr et al., 2011a) and (iii) ALK mutations that are ligand-dependent in nature.

A total of 189 paraffin-embedded RMS tumor specimens from 145 patients were collected on tissue microarray. ALK protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. ALK gene (2p23) copy number and translocations were determined by in situ hybridization. cDNA sequencing of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain of the ALK gene was assessed in 43 samples. Strong cytoplasmic ALK protein expression was more frequently observed in alveolar RMS (ARMS) than in embryonal RMS (ERMS) (81% v 32%, respectively; P &lt; .001). ALK gene copy number gain was detected in the vast majority of ARMS (88%), compared with 52% of ERMS (P &lt; .001). ALK copy number correlated with protein expression in primary tumors (n = 107). We identified one point mutation (2%) and seven tumors harboring whole exon deletions (16%). In ERMS, specific ALK gain in the primary tumor correlated with metastatic disease (100% in metastatic disease v 29% in nonmetastatic disease; P = .004) and poor disease-specific survival (5-year disease-specific survival: 62% v 82% for nonspecific or no gain; P = .046). Because ALK aberrations on genomic and protein levels are frequently found in RMSs, in particular ARMS, and are associated with disease progression and outcome in ERMS, ALK may play a role in tumor biology and may provide a potential therapeutic target for these tumors.

We aimed to test an EML4-ALK transgenic mouse model as a platform for assessing the efficacy of ALK inhibitors and examining mechanisms of acquired resistance to ALK inhibitors. Transgenic mouse lines harboring LoxP-STOP-LoxP-FLAGS-tagged human EML4-ALK (variant 1) transgene was established by using C57BL/6N mice. The transgenic mouse model with highly lung-specific, inducible expression of echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4-ALK fusion protein was established by crossing the EML4-ALK transgenic mice with mice expressing Cre-estrogen receptor fusion protein under the control of surfactant protein C gene (SPC). Expression of EML4-ALK transgene was induced by intraperitoneally injecting mice with tamoxifen. When the lung tumor of the mice treated with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib for 2 weeks was measured, tumor shrinkage was observed. EML4-ALK tumor developed after 1 week of tamoxifen treatment. Echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4-ALK was strongly expressed in the lung but not in other organs. ALK and FLAGS expressions were observed by immunohistochemistry. Treatment of EML4-ALK tumor-bearing mice with crizotinib for 2 weeks induced dramatic shrinkage of tumors with no signs of toxicity. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with crizotinib led to acquired resistance in tumors, resulting in regrowth and disease progression. The resistant tumor nodules revealed acquired ALK G1202R mutations. An EML4-ALK transgenic mouse model for study of drug resistance was successfully established with short duration of tumorigenesis. This model should be a strong preclinical model for testing efficacy of ALK TKIs, providing a useful tool for investigating the mechanisms of acquired resistance and pursuing novel treatment strategies in ALK-positive lung cancer.",

However, secondary mutations may occur that, generate tumor resistance to ALK inhibitors. To overcome resistance to ALK inhibitors in NB, we adopted an alternative RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutic strategy that is able to knockdown ALK, regardless of its genetic status [mutated, amplified, wild-type (WT)]. NB cell lines, transduced by lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA), showed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis when ALK was knocked down. In mice, a nanodelivery system for ALK-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), based on the conjugation of antibodies directed against the NB-selective marker GD(2) to liposomes, showed strong ALK knockdown in vivo in NB cells, which resulted in cell growth arrest, apoptosis, and prolonged survival. ALK knockdown was associated with marked reductions in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, blood vessel density, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression in vivo, suggesting a role for ALK in NB-induced neoangiogenesis and tumor invasion, confirming this gene as a fundamental oncogene in NB.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28681972": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in adults worldwide, but its epidemiology varies markedly by region. Whilst in high-income countries, the predominant burden of CAP is in the elderly and those with chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary co-morbidity, CAP patients in low-income settings are often of working age and, in sub-Saharan Africa, frequently HIV-positive. Although region-specific aetiological data are limited, they are sufficient to highlight major trends: in high-burden settings, tuberculosis (TB) is a common cause of acute CAP; Gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae are regionally important; and HIV-associated opportunistic infections are common but difficult to diagnose. These differences in epidemiology and aetiological profile suggest that modified approaches to diagnosis, severity assessment and empirical antimicrobial therapy of CAP are necessary, but tailored individualized management approaches are constrained by limitations in the availability of radiological and laboratory diagnostic services, as well as medical expertise. The widespread introduction of the Xpert MTB/RIF platform represents a major advance for TB diagnosis, but innovations in rapid diagnostics for other opportunistic pathogens are urgently needed. Severity assessment tools (e.g. CURB65) that are used to guide early management decisions in CAP have not been widely validated in low-income settings and locally adapted tools are required. The optimal approach to initial antimicrobial therapy choices such as the need to provide early empirical cover for atypical bacteria and TB remain poorly defined. Improvements in supportive care such as correcting hypoxaemia and intravenous fluid management represent opportunities for substantial reductions in mortality.",

Serum biomarkers including procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated in the emergency department. Scores for the pneumonia severity index (PSI); CURB65 (confusion, urea, respiration, blood pressure; age &gt;65 years); Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for severe CAP; Acute Physiology, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA); and quick SOFA (qSOFA) were calculated. Receiver-operating characteristic curves for 28-day mortality were calculated for each predictor using cut-off values, and we applied logistic regression models and area under the curve (AUC) analysis to compare the performance of predictors. Of the 125 enrolled patients, 13 died within 28 days. The AUCs of the PCT and CRP were 0.83 and 0.77, respectively. Using a PCT level &gt;5.6 \u03bcg/L as the cut-off, the sensitivity and specificity for mortality were 76.9% and 90.2%, respectively. The three pneumonia severity scales showed an AUC of 0.86 (PSI), 0.87 (IDSA/ATS) and 0.77 (CURB65). The AUCs of the APACHE II, SOFA and qSOFA scores were 0.85, 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. The models combining CRP and/or PCT with PSI or the IDSA/ATS guidelines demonstrated superior performance to those of either PSI or the IDAS/ATS guidelines alone. In conclusion, serum PCT is a reliable single predictor for short-term mortality. Inclusion of CRP and/or PCT could significantly improve the performance of the PSI and IDAS/ATS guidelines.",

Observational prospective, single-center study in patients with suspected community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Eighty one patients underwent full clinical and laboratory assessment as by protocol, and were followed up a 28 days. Primary endpoints measured were: death, death at 14 days, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), endotracheal intubation (EI), ICU admission, overall hospital stay &gt;10 days, emergency department stay &gt;4 days. The discriminative performance of MR-pro-ADM and clinical scores was assessed by AUROC analysis. The distribution for MR-pro-ADM followed an upward trend, increasing with the increase of both PSI (p&lt;0.001) and CURB65 (p&lt;0.001) classes. However, the difference between MRproADM values and score classes was significant only in the case of CURB65 classes 0 and 1 (p = 0.046), 2 (p = 0.013), and 3 (p = 0.011); and with PSI classes 5, 3 (p = 0.044), and 1 (p = 0.020). As to the differences among variables for the six end-points, MR-pro-ADM values in the two groups selected for each considered end-point differed in a statistically significant manner for all endpoints. Both PSI and CURB65 differed significantly for all end-points, except for stay in the ED longer than 4 days and the hospital stay longer than 10 days and endotracheal intubation (only PSI classes differed with statistical significance). ROC analyses evidenced that MR-pro-ADM values gave the greatest AUC for the prediction of death, endotracheal intubation, hospital stay &gt;10 days and DE stay &gt;4 days, compared to the PSI and CURB (though difference not statistically significant). For each endpoint measured, the best thresholds values for Mr-pro-ADM were: 1.6 (specificity 76.5%; sensitivity 77.8%) for death; 2.5 (specificity 88.9%; sensitivity 80.0%) for death at 14 days; 1.5 (specificity 77.0%; sensitivity 87.5%) for NIMV; 2.4 (specificity 88.7%; sensitivity 83.3%) for endotracheal intubation; 0.9 (specificity 53.5%; sensitivity 70.6%) for DE stay greater than 4 days; 1.9 (specificity 82.1%; sensitivity 55.3%) for hospital stay greater than 10 days. The AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and PSI was 81.29% [63.41%-99.17%], but not in a statistically significant manner compared to the AUCs of the single predictors. Conversely, the AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and CURB65 was 87.58% [75.54%-99.62%], which was significantly greater than the AUC of CURB65 (p = 0.047) or PSI (p = 0.017) alone. The present study confirms that assessment of MR-pro-ADM levels in CAP patients in addition to CURB scores increases the prognostic accuracy of CURB alone and may help rule out discrepancies arising from flawed clinical severity classification. With particular reference to patients scoring in the upper classes of CURB and PSI, MR-pro-ADM values provided additional information towards a better risk stratification of those patients. In particular, our results pointed towards two MR-pro-ADM threshold values that appear to predict with a good degree of accuracy the patient's need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation, or intensive care. This aspect, however, deserves further investigation.",

Immune dysregulation during acute lung infection plays a role in lung injury and the systemic inflammatory response. Cytokines seem to be major players in severe lung infection cases. Here, we present a review of published papers in the last 3 years regarding this topic. The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA. Treatment focused in the cytokine environment is an interesting area that could impact the prognosis of CAP. Some of the agents that have been studied as co-adjuvant therapy are corticosteroids, macrolides, and linezolid, but anyone of those have shown a clear or proven efficacy or have been recommended as a part of the standard of care for CAP. More studies designed to define the role of immunomodulatory agents, such as co-adjuvant therapy in pneumonia, are needed.",

A risk-prediction model using information easily obtained on admission could help to identify high-risk individuals. The CURB65 score was developed to predict mortality risk in community acquired pneumonia. A retrospective study found that this score was also associated with mortality in COPD exacerbations. We conducted a prospective study to assess the utility of the CURB65 score in acute COPD exacerbations. Consecutive patients with physician diagnosed COPD exacerbations admitted to a public hospital during a 1-year period were studied prospectively. The CURB65 scores were calculated from information obtained at initial hospital presentation. CURB65 = one point each for Confusion, Urea &gt; 7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate \u2265 30/min, low Blood pressure, age \u2265 65 years. 30-day mortality data were available for 249 of 252 patients. CURB65 scores on admission significantly predicted risk of death during the hospital admission and at 30 days. The 30-day mortality by score groups were: low risk (scores 0-1) 2.0% (2/98), moderate risk (score 2) 6.7% (6/90) and high risk (scores 3-5) 21.3% (13/61). CURB65 scores were not predictive of 1-year mortality. A simple 6-point score based on confusion, blood urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure and age can be used to stratify patients with COPD exacerbation into different management groups. The CURB65 score was as effective in predicting early mortality in our cohort of acute COPD exacerbations as it was in previous cohorts with community acquired pneumonia. Our findings suggest that CURB65 scores can help clinicians to assess patients with exacerbation of COPD.",

However, it has not been tested against generic sepsis and early warning scores, which are increasingly being advocated for identification of high-risk patients in acute medical wards. A retrospective analysis was performed of data prospectively collected for a CAP quality improvement study. The ability to stratify mortality and performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the receiver operating curve) were calculated for stratifications of CURB65, CRB65, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and the standardised early warning score (SEWS). 419 patients were included in the main analysis with a median age of 74 years (men = 47%). CURB65 and CRB65 stratified mortality in a more clinically useful way and had more favourable operating characteristics than SIRS or SEWS; for example, mortality in low-risk patients was 2% when defined by CURB65, but 9% when defined by SEWS and 11-17% when defined by variations of the SIRS criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CURB65 was 71%, 69%, 35% and 91%, respectively, compared with 62%, 73%, 35% and 89% for the best performing version of SIRS and 52%, 67%, 27% and 86% for SEWS. CURB65 had the greatest area under the receiver operating curve (0.78 v 0.73 for CRB65, 0.68 for SIRS and 0.64 for SEWS). CURB65 should not be supplanted by SIRS or SEWS for initial prognostic assessment in CAP. Further research to identify better generic prognostic tools is required.",

We aimed to derive a practical algorithm combining the CURB65 score with ProADM-levels in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-CAP-LRTI. We used data of 1359 patients with LRTI enrolled in a multicenter study. We chose two ProADM cut-off values by assessing the association between ProADM levels and the risk of adverse events and mortality. A composite score (CURB65-A) was created combining CURB65 classes with ProADM cut-offs to further risk-stratify patients. CURB65 and ProADM predicted both adverse events and mortality similarly well in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI. The combined CURB65-A risk score provided better prediction of death and adverse events than the CURB65 score in the entire cohort and in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI patients. Within each CURB65 class, higher ProADM-levels were associated with an increased risk of adverse events and mortality. Overall, risk of adverse events (3.9%) and mortality (0.65%) was low for patients with CURB65 score 0-1 and ProADM \u22640.75 nmol/l (CURB65-A risk class I); intermediate (8.6% and 2.6%, respectively) for patients with CURB65 score of 2 and ProADM \u22641.5 nmol/l or CURB classes 0-1 and ProADM levels between 0.75-1.5 nmol/L (CURB65-A risk class II), and high (21.6% and 9.8%, respectively) for all other patients (CURB65-A risk class III). If outpatient treatment was recommended for CURB65-A risk class I and short hospitalization for CURB65-A risk class II, 17.9% and 40.8% of 1217 hospitalized patients could have received ambulatory treatment or a short hospitalization, respectively.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of Presepsin and the CURB65 scoring system in the evaluation of severity and outcome of CAP in an ED. A prospective, observational study was performed in an ED of an university teaching hospital from November 2011 to October 2012. A total of 359 patients with CAP and 214 patients with severe CAP (SCAP) were consecutively enrolled. Plasma Presepsin, lactate, serum PCT levels and leukocyte counts were measured and CURB65 score were calculated at admission enrollment. Plasma Presepsin levels were significantly higher in SCAP patients than in CAP patients (P &lt; 0.0001), increasing correspondingly with the enhancement of CURB65 score. Patients with ARDS or DIC had obviously higher plasma Presepsin levels than those without ARDS or DIC (all P &lt; 0.0001), and plasma Presepsin levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors at 28-day follow-up. In logistic regression analysis, CURB65 score was the independent predictor of ARDS, and Presepsin was the independent predictor of DIC, and Presepsin and CURB65 score were both the independent predictors of 28-day mortality. The AUCs showed Presepsin in combination with CURB65 score in predicting ARDS, SCAP and 28-day mortality was superior to Presepsin or CURB65 score alone ( all P &lt; 0.01), Presepsin was better than CURB65 score and leukocyte in predicting DIC ( P &lt; 0.01).

From September, 2011, until April, 2012, we performed a post-study prospective observational quality control survey at the cantonal Hospital of Aarau, Switzerland of consecutive adults with CAP. The primary endpoint was length of stay (LOS) during the index hospitalization and within 30 days. We compared the results with two well-defined historic cohorts of CAP patients hospitalized in the same hospital with the use of multivariate regression, namely 83 patients in the observation study without ProADM (OPTIMA I) and the 169 patients in the intervention study (OPTIMA II RCT). A total of 89 patients with confirmed CAP were included. As compared to patients with CURB65 only observed in the OPTIMA I study, adjusted regression analysis showed a significant shorter initial LOS (7.5 vs. 10.4 days; -2.32; 95% CI, -4.51 to -0.13; p = 0.04) when CURB65-A was used in clinical routine. No significant differences were found for LOS within 30 days. There were no significant differences in safety outcomes in regard to mortality and ICU admission between the cohorts. This post-study survey provides evidence that the use of ProADM in combination with CURB65 (CURB65-A) in \"real life\" situations reduces initial LOS compared to the CURB65 score alone without apparent negative effects on patient safety.",

For each case, HBP was graded as adequate or suboptimal, based on Liver Image Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) criteria. The following laboratory data obtained within 3 months of the MRI date was extracted: total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and International normalised ratio (INR).

The study failed its primary and secondary end point in a population with sAH and with a MELD ranging from 18 to 35 and no upper age limit. In the prespecified analysis of subjects with MELD &lt; 28 (n = 120), ELAD was associated with a trend toward higher OS at 91 days (68.6% versus 53.6%; P = .08). Regression analysis identified high creatinine and international normalized ratio, but not bilirubin, as the MELD components predicting negative outcomes with ELAD.

We focused on ID-MS traceable method such as compensated Jaffe (cJafCreat) and enzymatic (EnzCreat) methods. Potential protein-related interferences in creatinine determination were evaluated using dialysates spiked with albumin. MELD score, CKD-EPI formula creatinine-based eGFR and cystatin C-based eGFR were evaluated in 100 cirrhotic patients. In vitro model demonstrated that low protein levels result in an underestimation of creatinine levels using cJafCreat. In patients, cJafCreat created a negative bias of -6.1 \u03bcmol/L that led to higher eGFR and lower MELD scores. cJafCreat contributes to an overestimation of renal function in cirrhotic patients and may alter cirrhosis-severity assessment. Compensated Jaffe assays should therefore be replaced by enzymatic methods.",

However, the MELD is problematic in patients undergoing warfarin therapy, as warfarin affects the international normalized ratio (INR). This study aimed to determine whether a simplified MELD score that does not require the INR for calculation could predict mortality for patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery. Simplified MELD score = 3.8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9.6*LN[creatinine] + 6.4. A total of 172 patients (male: 66, female: 106; mean age, 63.8 \u00b1 10.3 years) who underwent tricuspid replacement (n = 18) or repair (n = 154) from January 1991 to July 2011 at a single centre were included. Of them, 168 patients in whom the simplified MELD score could be calculated were retrospectively analysed. The relationship between in-hospital mortality and perioperative variables was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The rate of in-hospital mortality was 6.4%. The mean admission simplified MELD score for the patients who died was significantly higher than for those surviving beyond discharge (11.3 \u00b1 4.1 vs 5.8 \u00b1 4.0; P = 0.001). By multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality included higher simplified MELD score (P = 0.001) and tricuspid valve replacement (P = 0.023). In-hospital mortality and morbidity increased along with increasing simplified MELD score. Scores &lt;0, 0-6.9, 7-13.9 and &gt;14 were associated with mortalities of 0, 2.0, 8.3 and 66.7%, respectively. The incidence of serious complications (multiple organ failure, P = 0.005; prolonged ventilation, P = 0.01; need for haemodialysis; P = 0.002) was also significantly higher in patients with simplified MELD score \u2265 7.

From January 2004 to October 2008, the records of 4127 admitted cirrhotic patients were reviewed. Patients who survived and were followed up as outpatients were defined as survivors and their most recent available laboratory data were collected. Patients whose records indicated death at any time during the hospital stay were defined as non-survivors (in-hospital mortality). Patients with incomplete data or with cirrhosis due to a congenital abnormality such as primary biliary cirrhosis were excluded; thus, a total of 3857 patients were enrolled in the present study. The eGFR, which was calculated by using either the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation or the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, was incorporated into the MELD score after adjustment with the original MELD equation by logistic regression analysis [bilirubin and international normalized ratio (INR) were set at 1.0 for values less than 1.0]. Patients defined as survivors were significantly younger, had a lower incidence of hepatoma, lower Child-Pugh and MELD scores, and better renal function. The underlying causes of cirrhosis were very different from those in Western countries. In Taiwan, most cirrhotic patients were associated with the hepatitis virus, especially hepatitis B. There were 16 parameters included in univariate logistic regression analysis to predict in-hospital mortality and those with significant predicting values were included in further multivariate analysis. Both 4-variable MDRD eGFR and 6-variable MDRD eGFR, rather than creatinine, were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Three new equations were constructed (MELD-MDRD-4, MELD-MDRD-6, MELD-CKD-EPI). As expected, original MELD score was a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio = 1.25, P &lt; 0.001). MELD-MDRD-4 excluded serum creatinine, with the coefficients refit among the remaining 3 variables, i.e., total bilirubin, INR and 4-variable MDRD eGFR. This model represented an exacerbated outcome over MELD score, as suggested by a decrease in chi-square (2161.45 vs 2198.32) and an increase in -2 log (likelihood) (2810.77 vs 2773.90). MELD-MDRD-6 included 6-variable MDRD eGFR as one of the variables and showed an improvement over MELD score, as suggested by an increase in chi-square (2293.82 vs 2198.32) and a decrease in -2 log (likelihood) (2810.77 vs 2664.79). Finally, when serum creatinine was replaced by CKD-EPI eGFR, it showed a slight improvement compared to the original MELD score (chi-square: 2199.16, -2 log (likelihood): 2773.07). In the receiver-operating characteristic curve, the MELD-MDRD-6 score showed a marginal improvement in area under the curve (0.909 vs 0.902), sensitivity (0.854 vs 0.819) and specificity (0.818 vs 0.839) compared to the original MELD equation. In patients with a different eGFR, the MELD-MDRD-6 equation showed a better predictive value in patients with eGFR \u2265 90, 60-89, 30-59 and 15-29. Incorporating eGFR obtained by the 6-variable MDRD equation into the MELD score showed an equal predictive performance in in-hospital mortality compared to a creatinine-based MELD score.",

We examined the neuronally directed effects of the retinoid X receptor agonist bexarotene in an aggressive model of AD. We report that a two week treatment of 3.5 month old 5XFAD mice with bexarotene resulted in the clearance of intraneuronal amyloid deposits. Importantly, neuronal loss was attenuated by 44% in the subiculum in mice 4 months of age and 18% in layer V of the cortex in mice 8 months of age. Moreover, bexarotene treatment improved remote memory stabilization in fear conditioned mice and improved olfactory cross habituation. These improvements in neuron viability and function were correlated with significant increases in the levels of post-synaptic marker PSD95 and the pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin. Moreover, bexarotene pretreatment improved neuron survival in primary 5XFAD neurons in vitro in response to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. The salutary effects of bexarotene were accompanied by reduced plaque burden, decreased astrogliosis, and suppression of inflammatory gene expression. Collectively, these data provide evidence that bexarotene treatment reduced neuron loss, elevated levels of markers of synaptic integrity that was linked to improved cognition and in an aggressive model of AD.",

Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is a protein methyltransferase that negatively regulates synaptic gene expression and inhibits neuronal differentiation. Despite its regulatory function in neurons, little is known about the CARM1 cellular location and its role in dendritic maturation and synapse formation. Here, we examined the effects of CARM1 inhibition on dendritic spine and synapse morphology in the rat hippocampus. CARM1 was localized in hippocampal post-synapses, with immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy revealing co-localization of CARM1 with post-synaptic density (PSD)-95 protein, a post-synaptic marker. Specific siRNA-mediated suppression of CARM1 expression resulted in precocious dendritic maturation, with increased spine width and density at sites along dendrites and induction of mushroom-type spines. These changes were accompanied by a striking increase in the cluster size and number of key synaptic proteins, including <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) and PSD-95. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of CARM1 activity with the CARM1-specific inhibitor AMI-1 significantly increased spine width and mushroom-type spines and also increased the cluster size and number of NR2B and cluster size of PSD-95. These results suggest that CARM1 is a post-synaptic protein that plays roles in dendritic maturation and synaptic formation and that spatiotemporal regulation of CARM1 activity modulates neuronal connectivity and improves synaptic dysfunction.",

However, the potential sex difference among these studies has not been well considered, and it is unknown whether male or female AD patients are more vulnerable to develop postoperative cognitive dysfunction. We therefore set out to perform a proof of concept study to determine whether anesthesia and surgery can have different effects in male and female AD transgenic (Tg) mice, and in female AD Tg plus Cyclophilin D knockout (CypD KO) mice. The mice received an abdominal surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia (anesthesia/surgery). Fear Conditioning System (FCS) was used to assess the cognitive function. Hippocampal levels of synaptic marker postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SVP) were measured using western blot analysis. Here we showed that the anesthesia/surgery decreased the freezing time in context test of FCS at 7 days after the anesthesia/surgery in female, but not male, mice. The anesthesia/surgery reduced hippocampus levels of synaptic marker PSD-95 and SVP in female, but not male, mice. The anesthesia/surgery induced neither reduction in freezing time in FCS nor decreased hippocampus levels of PSD-95 and SVP in the AD Tg plus CypD KO mice. These data suggest that the anesthesia/surgery induced a sex-dependent cognitive impairment and reduction in hippocampus levels of synaptic markers in AD Tg mice, potentially via a mitochondria-associated mechanism. These findings could promote clinical investigations to determine whether female AD patients are more vulnerable to the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438613": "Traumatic stress patients showed significant improvement in behavior after a prolonged exposure to an unrelated stimulus. This treatment method attempts to promote extinction of the fear memory associated with the initial traumatic experience. However, the subsequent prolonged exposure to such stimulus creates an additional layer of neural stress. Although the mechanism remains unclear, prolonged exposure therapy (PET) likely involves changes in synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter function and inflammation; especially in parts of the brain concerned with the formation and retrieval of fear memory (Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex: PFC). Since certain synaptic proteins are also involved in danger-associated molecular pattern signaling (DAMP), we identified the significance of IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKII\u03b1 expression as a potential link between the concurrent progression of synaptic and inflammatory changes in stress. Thus, a comparison between IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKII\u03b1, synaptic and DAMP proteins in stress and PET may highlight the significance of PET on synaptic morphology and neuronal inflammatory response. In behaviorally characterized Sprague-Dawley rats, there was a significant decline in neural IGF-1 (p&lt;0.001), hippocampal (p&lt;0.001) and cortical (p&lt;0.05) IGF-1R expression. These animals showed a significant loss of presynaptic markers (synaptophysin; p&lt;0.001), and changes in neurotransmitters (VGLUT2, Tyrosine hydroxylase, GABA, ChAT). Furthermore, na\u00efve stressed rats recorded a significant decrease in post-synaptic marker (PSD-95; p&lt;0.01) and synaptic regulator (CaMKII\u03b1; p&lt;0.001). As part of the synaptic response to a decrease in brain CaMKII\u03b1, small ion conductance channel (KCa2.2) was upregulated in the brain of na\u00efve stressed rats (p&lt;0.01). After a PET, an increase in IGF-1 (p&lt;0.05) and IGF-1R was recorded in the Stress-PET group (p&lt;0.001). As such, hippocampal (p&lt;0.001), but not cortical (ns) synaptophysin expression increased in Stress-PET. Although PSD-95 was relatively unchanged in the hippocampus and PFC, CaMKII\u03b1 (p&lt;0.001) and KCa2.2 (p&lt;0.01) were upregulated in Stress-PET, and may be involved in extinction of fear memory-related synaptic potentials. These changes were also associated with a normalized neurotransmitter function, and a significant reduction in open space avoidance; when the animals were assessed in elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to a decrease in IGF-1/IGF-1R, an increase in activated hippocampal and cortical microglia was seen in stress (p&lt;0.05) and after a PET (Stress-PET; p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, this was linked with a significant increase in HMGB1 (Hippocampus: p&lt;0.001, PFC: p&lt;0.05) and TLR4 expression (Hippocampus: p&lt;0.01; PFC: ns) in the neurons. Taken together, this study showed that traumatic stress and subsequent PET involves an event-dependent alteration of IGF1/IGF-1R/CaMKII\u03b1. Firstly, we showed a direct relationship between IGF-1/IGF-1R expression, presynaptic function (synaptophysin) and neurotransmitter activity in stress and PET. Secondly, we identified the possible role of CaMKII\u03b1 in post-synaptic function and regulation of small ion conductance channels. Lastly, we highlighted some of the possible links between IGF1/IGF-1R/CaMKII\u03b1, the expression of DAMP proteins, Microglia activation, and its implication on synaptic plasticity during stress and PET.",

We previously demonstrated that adult female rats exposed to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during adolescence develop long-term alterations in cognitive performances and emotional reactivity, whereas preliminary evidence suggests the presence of a different phenotype in male rats. To thoroughly depict the behavioral phenotype induced by adolescent THC exposure in male rats, we treated adolescent animals with increasing doses of THC twice a day (PND 35-45) and, at adulthood, we performed a battery of behavioral tests to measure affective- and psychotic-like symptoms as well as cognition. Poorer memory performance and psychotic-like behaviors were present after adolescent THC treatment in male rats, without alterations in the emotional component. At cellular level, the expression of the NMDA receptor subunit, GluN2B, as well as the levels of the AMPA subunits, GluA1 and GluA2, were significantly increased in hippocampal post-synaptic fractions from THC-exposed rats compared to controls. Furthermore, increases in the levels of the pre-synaptic marker, synaptophysin, and the post-synaptic marker, PSD95, were also present. Interestingly, KCl-induced [(3)H]D-ASP release from hippocampal synaptosomes, but not gliosomes, was significantly enhanced in THC-treated rats compared to controls. Moreover, in the same brain region, adolescent THC treatment also resulted in a persistent neuroinflammatory state, characterized by increased expression of the astrocyte marker, GFAP, increased levels of the pro-inflammatory markers, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS and COX-2, as well as a concomitant reduction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Notably, none of these alterations was observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Together with our previous findings in females, these data suggest that the sex-dependent detrimental effects induced by adolescent THC exposure on adult behavior may rely on its ability to trigger different region-dependent changes in glutamate synapse and glial cells. The phenotype observed in males is mainly associated with marked dysregulations in the hippocampus, whereas the prevalence of alterations in the emotional sphere in females is associated with profound changes in the PFC.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28987163": "Major cell types of the central nervous system comprise neurons, glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglia), choroid plexus cells, cells related to blood vessels and coverings. These cells show a wide range of reactions to various noxious agents, which can be detected in routine stainings. Some of these reactions are nonspecific to different injuries; however some, such as the appearance of inclusion bodies, can be highly disease-specific. Immunohistochemical markers are widely used in neuropathologic diagnostic practice and help to understand the pathogenesis of diseases. The most widely used neuronal markers comprise phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated neurofilaments, microtubule-associated protein-2, NeuN, or synaptic markers such as synaptophysin. The best antibody for the detection of astrocytes is anti-GFAP (glial fibrillar acidic protein); however, to support a glial origin, S100 or vimentin is also used in the diagnostic practice. Further astroglial markers include connexin-43, excitatory amino acid transporters, aquaporin-4, heat shock protein Hsp27, and \u03b1-B-crystallin. Depending whether the tissue is fixed or nonfixed, different oligodendroglial markers are available, such as myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, proteolipid protein, Olig2, NG2, 2' 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), and tubulin polymerization-promoting protein/p25 alpha (TPPP/p25). A wide range of microglia functions is recognized. Apart from a role in immune-mediated disorders, inflammation, and response to injury, microglia are important during the development and aging of the brain. The best markers include the clone CR3/43, Iba1, and CD68. Evaluation of cell reactions is the first step in the diagnostic procedure.",

One explanation for this failure may be the invalidity of hypotheses focusing on amyloid to explain AD pathogenesis. Recently, hypotheses which are centered on synaptic and metabolic dysfunction are increasingly implicated in AD. Evaluate AD hypotheses by comparing neurotransmitter and metabolite marker concentrations in normal versus AD CSF. Meta-analysis allows for statistical comparison of pooled, existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker data extracted from multiple publications, to obtain a more reliable estimate of concentrations. This method also provides a unique opportunity to rapidly validate AD hypotheses using the resulting CSF concentration data. Hubmed, Pubmed and Google Scholar were comprehensively searched for published English articles, without date restrictions, for the keywords \"AD\", \"CSF\", and \"human\" plus markers selected for synaptic and metabolic pathways. Synaptic markers were acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine, and glycine. Metabolic markers were glutathione, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and 8 other amino acids. Only studies that measured markers in AD and controls (Ctl), provided means, standard errors/deviation, and subject numbers were included. Data were extracted by six authors and reviewed by two others for accuracy. Data were pooled using ratio of means (RoM of AD/Ctl) and random effects meta-analysis using Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software. Of the 435 identified publications, after exclusion and removal of duplicates, 35 articles were included comprising a total of 605 AD patients and 585 controls. The following markers of synaptic and metabolic pathways were significantly changed in AD/controls: acetylcholine (RoM 0.36, 95% CI 0.24-0.53, p&lt;0.00001), GABA (0.74, 0.58-0.94, p&lt;0.01), pyruvate (0.48, 0.24-0.94, p=0.03), glutathione (1.11, 1.01- 1.21, p=0.03), alanine (1.10, 0.98-1.23, p=0.09), and lower levels of significance for lactate (1.2, 1.00-1.47, p=0.05). Of note, CSF glucose and glutamate levels in AD were not significantly different than that of the controls. This study provides proof of concept for the use of meta-analysis validation of AD hypotheses, specifically via robust evidence for the cholinergic hypothesis of AD. Our data disagree with the other synaptic hypotheses of glutamate excitotoxicity and GABAergic resistance to neurodegeneration, given observed unchanged glutamate levels and decreased GABA levels. With regards to metabolic hypotheses, the data supported upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (glutathione), and anaplerosis of the tricarboxylic acid cycle using glutamate. Future applications of meta-analysis indicate the possibility of further in silico evaluation and generation of novel hypotheses in the AD field.",

Tamoxifen has demonstrated some efficacy has a therapeutic for bipolar mania and is believed to exert these effects through inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). As the symptoms of amphetamine treatment in rodents are believed to mimic the symptoms of a manic episode, many of the preclinical studies for this indication have demonstrated that tamoxifen inhibits amphetamine action. The amphetamine-induced increase in extracellular dopamine which gives rise to the 'manic' effects is due to interaction of amphetamine with the dopamine transporter. We and others have demonstrated that PKC reduces amphetamine-induced reverse transport through the dopamine transporter. In this review, we will outline the actions of tamoxifen as a SERM and further detail another known action of tamoxifen-inhibition of PKC.

Despite the good survival rates of these implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate; anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin, biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). Examples of the new therapies include DKK1- and anti-sclerostin antibodies. All classes of treatments have proven to possess positive impacts such as an increase in bone mineral density and on osseointegration. In order to prevent complications from occurring after surgery, some post-operative systemic drugs are administered; these can show an impairment in the osseointegration process. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The effects of aspirin, acetaminophen, opioids, adjuvants, anticoagulants and antibiotics in implant fixations are not fully understood, but studies are being carried out to investigate potential ramifications. It is currently accepted that systemic pharmacological agents can either enhance or impair implant osseointegration; therefore, proper drug selection is essential.

The role of ER\u03b1AF-1 for the estradiol (E2) effects is tissue specific. The selective ER modulators (SERMs) raloxifene (Ral), lasofoxifene (Las), and bazedoxifene (Bza) can be used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. They all reduce the risk for vertebral fractures, whereas Las and partly Bza, but not Ral, reduce the risk for nonvertebral fractures. Here, we have compared the tissue specificity of Ral, Las, and Bza and evaluated the role of ER\u03b1AF-1 for the effects of these SERMs, with an emphasis on bone parameters. We treated ovariectomized (OVX) wild-type (WT) mice and OVX mice lacking ER\u03b1AF-1 (ER\u03b1AF-1(0)) with E2, Ral, Las, or Bza. All three SERMs increased trabecular bone mass in the axial skeleton. In the appendicular skeleton, only Las increased the trabecular bone volume/tissue volume and trabecular number, whereas both Ral and Las increased the cortical bone thickness and strength. However, Ral also increased cortical porosity. The three SERMs had only a minor effect on uterine weight. Notably, all evaluated effects of these SERMs were absent in ovx ER\u03b1AF-1(0) mice. In conclusion, all SERMs had similar effects on axial bone mass. However, the SERMs had slightly different effects on the appendicular skeleton since only Las increased the trabecular bone mass and only Ral increased the cortical porosity. Importantly, all SERM effects require a functional ER\u03b1AF-1 in female mice. These results could lead to development of more specific treatments for osteoporosis.",

Clinical trials aim to differentiate amongst SERMs on selected target tissues for use in postmenopausal women including effects on breast, bone, cardiovascular venous thrombosis risk, endometrium, vagina, vasomotor symptoms, and brain. This paper describes differences in clinical effects on selected target tissues of SERMs that are approved, discontinued or in development. FDA approved SERMs include tamoxifen and toremifene used for prevention and treatment of breast cancer, raloxifene approved for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and prevention of invasive breast cancer, and ospemifene approved for treatment of dyspareunia from menopausal vaginal atrophy. The FDA approved first tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) a pairing of conjugated equine estrogens with the SERM, bazedoxifene. This pairing reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the estrogenic component of the TSEC without the need for a progestogen in women with a uterus. It also allows for the estrogenic benefits on relief of hot flashes and prevention of bone loss without stimulating the breast or the endometrium. In clinical practice, the tissue-selective actions of SERMs, alone or paired with estrogens, allow for individualization in meeting the treatment needs of postmenopausal women by providing targeted tissue effects.

The SERMs investigated in this study include raloxifene, tamoxifen, and the tamoxifen metabolites 4-hydroxytamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, and endoxifen. Equilibrium association constants (Ka) were measured for SERMs using varying lipid compositions to examine how lipid phase, packing density, and cholesterol content impact SERM-membrane interactions. Membrane-binding properties of tamoxifen and its metabolites were compared on the basis of hydroxyl group substitution and amine ionization to elucidate how the degree of drug ionization impacts membrane partitioning. SERM-membrane interactions were probed under multiple pH conditions, and drug adsorption was observed to vary with the concentration of soluble neutral species. The agreement between Ka values derived from SHG measurements of the interactions between SERMs and artificial cell membranes and independent observations of the SERMs efficacy from clinical studies suggests that quantifying membrane adsorption properties may be important for understanding SERM action in vivo.",

Tamoxifen, raloxifene and toremifene are the most widely used SERMs. Tamoxifen, an antagonist of the breast tissue, is the first clinically identified compound with noticeable SERM activity. Although tamoxifen has been very successful in breast cancer treatment, its agonistic effect on the uterus is said to be associated with increase risk of developing endometrial cancer. Ideally, it is presumed that SERMs should selectively act as an agonist in the bone and brain while simultaneously acting as an antagonist in the breast and uterus. Therefore, the therapeutic goal of SERMs is the prevention of estrogen deficiency diseases without promoting estrogen-associated tumor growth. Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize various effects that have been applied in improving the tissue-selectivity of SERMs, highlighting the emerging understanding of their mechanism of actions in selected target tissues and the development of the SERMs. The significance in recent discovery of selective estrogen receptor alpha modulators, SERAMs will also be reviewed.",

Clomifene, tamoxifen, toremifene and raloxifene are generally classified as SERM in the clinical use. The main cause of postmenopausal osteoporosis is estrogen deficiency and it was revealed that the continuous combined use of conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate reduced the relative risk of femoral neck fracture to 0.66, however increased the relative risk of cardiovascular event and breast cancer to 1.29 or 1.26, respectively. From the standpoint of safe and clinical compliance for the breast and uterine tissue, raloxifene is recommendable for middle aged postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

In this study, we have performed a comprehensive head-to-head analysis of the transcriptional activity of these different classes of ERM in a cellular model of breast cancer. Not surprisingly, these studies highlighted important functional differences and similarities among the existing SERM, selective ER degraders, and TSEC. Of particular importance was the identification of genes that were regulated by various TSEC combinations but not by an estrogen or SERM alone. Cumulatively, the findings of this analysis are informative with respect to the mechanisms by which ER is engaged by different enhancers/promoters and highlights how promoter context influences the pharmacological activity of ER ligands.",

Our laboratory recently demonstrated that 17-beta-estradiol (E2) promotes the GM-CSF-mediated development of CD11c+ CD11b(int) DC from murine bone marrow precursors. We tested whether the therapeutic selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), raloxifene and tamoxifen, can perturb DC development and activation. SERM, used in treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis, bind to ER and mediate tissue-specific agonistic or antagonistic effects. Raloxifene and tamoxifen inhibited the differentiation of estrogen-dependent DC from bone marrow precursors ex vivo in competition experiments with physiological levels of E2. DC differentiated in the presence of SERM were assessed for their capacity to internalize fluoresceinated Ags as well as respond to inflammatory stimuli by increasing surface expression of molecules important for APC function. Although SERM-exposed DC exhibited increased ability to internalize Ags, they were hyporesponsive to bacterial LPS: relative to control DC, they less efficiently up-regulated the expression of MHC class II, CD86, and to a lesser extent, CD80 and CD40. This phenotype indicates that these SERM act to maintain DC in an immature state by inhibiting DC responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Thus, raloxifene and tamoxifen impair E2-promoted DC differentiation and reduce the immunostimulatory capacity of DC. These observations suggest that SERM may depress immunity when given to healthy individuals for the prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer and may interfere with immunotherapeutic strategies to improve antitumor immunity in breast cancer patients.",

An ideal SERM is a compound with an oestrogen antagonist effect on the breast and uterus but oestrogen agonist effect on bone. Beside tamoxifen, a group of well-investigated SERMs is represented by raloxifene, LY-353381 (SERM3), EM-800 and CP-336156. On an empirical basis, tamoxifen has been used to pharmacologically treat desmoid tumours. Recently, raloxifene, a second-generation SERM, has been used in the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis patients affected by desmoid tumour. The mechanisms through which these molecules affect desmoid tumour growth appear to be due, in part, to the fact that SERMs may act independently of oestrogen receptors. The knowledge of the molecular basis of SERM action will make the development of novel synthetic compounds with engineered tissue selectivity possible.",

This is the first study to quantify social, cultural, and psychologic factors driving decision making regarding SERM use in women counseled on breast cancer prevention options. A survey study was conducted with women counseled by a health care provider (HCP) about SERMs. A statistical comparison of responses was performed between those who decided to use and those who decided not to use SERMs. Independent factors associated with the decision were determined using logistic regression. Of 1,023 participants, 726 made a decision: 324 (44.6%) decided to take a SERM and 402 (55.4%) decided not to. The most important factor for deciding on SERM use was the HCP recommendation. Other characteristics associated with the decision included attitudes and perceptions regarding medication intake, breast cancer worry, trust in HCP, family members with blood clots, and others' experiences with SERMs. The odds of SERM intake when HCP recommended were higher for participants with a positive attitude toward taking medications than for those with a negative attitude (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> = 0.01). This study highlights the importance of social and cultural aspects for SERM decision making, most importantly personal beliefs and experiences. HCPs' recommendations play a statistically significant role in decision making and are more likely to be followed if in line with patients' attitudes.

However, SERMs also increase the risk of developing ovarian cysts in this population, a phenomenon that is not seen in postmenopausal women. It is believed that current SERMs partially block estradiol's ability to downregulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus thereby interfering with estradiol's negative feedback, leading to increased ovarian stimulation by gonadotropins, and cyst formation. It has been postulated that a SERM with poor brain exposure would have less negative effect on the HPO axis, therefore reducing the risk of developing ovarian cysts. In order to test this hypothesis, we identified an early marker of SERM-dependent ovarian effects: upregulation of Cyp17a1 mRNA. SERMs known to cause ovarian cysts upregulate Cyp17a1 after only 4 days of dosing and suppression of the HPO axis prevented this regulation, indicating that ovarian expression of Cyp17a1 was secondary to SERM's effect on the brain. We then characterized three SERMs with similar binding affinity and antagonist effects on the uterus for their relative brain/plasma exposure and ovarian effects. We found that the degree of brain exposure correlated very well with Cyp17a1 expression.",

RLX does not increase or decrease cardiovascular events, overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality or the overall number of strokes, but there appears to be a small increase in stroke mortality. Both RLX and tamoxifen similarly reduce the risk of ER-positive invasive breast cancer. At the same time, RLX treatment is associated with 36% fewer uterine cancer incidence and 29% less thromboembolic events.

Endometrial safety has been a key differentiator between SERMs in clinical practice. For example, tamoxifen exhibits ER agonist activity in the uterus, resulting in an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy, whereas raloxifene and bazedoxifene have neutral effects on the uterus. Based on their efficacy and long-term safety, SERMs are increasingly being prescribed for women who cannot tolerate other treatment options and for younger women at an increased risk of fracture who may remain on therapy for long periods of time. Continuing advances in the understanding of SERM mechanisms of action and structural interactions with the ER may lead to the development of new agents and combinations of agents to provide optimal treatments to meet the varying needs of postmenopausal women. One such example is the tissue selective estrogen complex, which partners a SERM with 1 or more estrogens, with the aim of blending the desired estrogen-receptor agonist activities of estrogens on vasomotor symptoms, vulvar-vaginal atrophy, and loss of bone mass with the tissue selectivity of a SERM.",

They exert their effects on bone via the estrogen receptor (ER) and the increase in bone mass is due to resorption inhibition. The effect of SERMs on bone mineral density is less than that with the other treatments, but the SERM raloxifene still has a positive effect on vertebral fractures. In contrast to tibolone and estrogens (+/-progestogen), SERMs do not treat climacteric complaints, whilst estrogen plus progestogen treatments cause a high incidence of bleeding. Estrogen plus progestogen combinations have compromising effects on the breast. Tibolone and SERMs do not stimulate the breast or endometrium. Unlike SERMs, tibolone does not possess antagonistic biological effects via the ER in these tissues. Estrogenic stimulation in these tissues is prevented by local metabolism and inhibition of steroid metabolizing enzymes by tibolone and its metabolites. SERMs and estrogen (+/-progestogen) treatments increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), whilst estrogen (+/-progestogen) combinations have unwanted effects on cardiovascular events. So far, no detrimental effects of tibolone have been observed with respect to VTE or cardiovascular events. The clinical profile of tibolone therefore has advantages over those of other treatment modalities. It is also clear that tibolone is a unique compound with a specific mode of action and that it belongs to a separate class of compounds that can best be described as selective, tissue estrogenic activity regulators (STEARs).",

This study aimed to investigate whether treatment with a SERM enhances spinal fusion in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. An in vivo animal study was carried out. Female Sprague Dawley rats (n=90) were OVX or sham-operated, and randomized into three groups: control (sham-operated+fusion procedure+saline administration), OVX (OVX+fusion procedure+saline administration), and SERM (OVX+fusion procedure+administration of SERM). Eight weeks after OVX, a bilateral lumbar spinal fusion procedure was performed using autologous iliac bone. In each group, gene expression was evaluated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the fusion procedure, histologic analysis was performed at 4 and 8 weeks after the procedure, and bone parameters were measured by micro-computed tomography at 2 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the procedure. Bone mineral density and trabecular quality of the vertebral body were significantly higher in the SERM group compared with the OVX group 16 weeks after OVX. The fusion rate and bone volume ratio were higher in the fusion bed of the SERM group compared with the OVX group 8 weeks after the fusion procedure. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at 4 and 8 weeks after the fusion procedure showed increased expression of the genes for osteoblast-related markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, runt-related transcription factor 2, and transforming growth factor) in the SERM group compared with the OVX group. The OVX group showed sparse bone mass between transverse processes. By contrast, the SERM group exhibited a compact bridging fusion mass within the fusion bed at 8 weeks after the fusion procedure. Selective estrogen receptor modulator treatment improved the trabecular quality of the vertebral body, enhanced spinal fusion, and increased the amount of compact bone mass within the fusion bed in rats that had received an ovariectomy.

The effects of all referred SERMs in bone and cardiovascular system are estrogenic, namely they inhibit postmenopausal bone loss and favorably influence plasma lipoproteins and some coagulation factors. The aim of this paper is to review the effects of SERMs on estrogen-dependent breast tissues and on the endometrium. There are two types of SERMs in clinical use, based on their chemical structure: the triphenylethylenes and the benzothiophenes. The prototype of the SERMs with triphenylethylene structure is tamoxifen. Tamoxifen, like all other SERMs, is an estrogen antagonist in the breast and is widely used for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. A recent study suggests that tamoxifen also may prevent breast cancer in patients at risk. Because of the partial estrogenic activity of tamoxifen in the endometrium, its clinical use is associated with uterine hypertrophy and an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Other triphenylethylene SERMs, droloxifene, toremifene, and idoxifene, also show efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer, in a manner similar to tamoxifen. A better toxicology profile and a decreased endometrial estrogen agonism may be advantages of the new triphenylethylene SERMs. Raloxifene is a SERM with a chemical structure different from triphenylethylenes. Raloxifene, a benzothiophene, possesses an estrogen-antagonistic effect in the breast similar to triphenylethylenes. Clinical studies on postmenopausal osteoporotic women on raloxifene as compared with placebo show a significant decrease in the rate of newly diagnosed breast cancers. In clinical studies, in contrast to tamoxifen, no stimulatory effect in the endometrium could be observed with raloxifene.",

Clinical publications were assessed for type of study, inclusion criteria, outcome measurements, and results. Strengths and weaknesses of the publications were assessed and discussed. Few prospective rigorously controlled trials have been undertaken on the use of SERMs in men. Most existing trials are largely retrospective anecdotal studies with inconsistent inclusion and end-point measurements. The SERMs are complex and at times can produce paradoxical results. Their action likely depends on the genetics of the individual, his tissue-specific composition of estrogen receptors, the molecular structure and pharmacodynamics of the SERMs, and their metabolism. Rigorously controlled trials of the use of SERMs in men are needed to better identify their clinical benefit and long-term safety in infertile and hypogonadal men.

Disadvantages of SERMs include exacerbation of menopausal symptoms and, as with estrogen, an increased incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli.

Mammary glands from female rats given the SERM LY2066948 hydrochloride (LY2066948) for 1 month at &gt;or= 175 mg/kg had intralobular ducts and alveoli lined by multiple layers of vacuolated, hypertrophied epithelial cells, resembling in part the morphology of the normal male rat mammary gland. We hypothesized that these SERM-mediated changes represented an androgen-dependent virilism of the female rat mammary gland. To test this hypothesis, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide was co-administered with LY2066948 (175 mg/kg) to female rats for 1 month. Female rats given SERM alone had hyperandrogenemia and the duct and alveolar changes described here. Flutamide cotreatment did not affect serum androgen levels but completely blocked the SERM-mediated mammary gland change. In the mouse, a species that does not have the sex-specific differences in the mammary gland observed in the rat, SERM treatment resulted in hyperandrogenemia but did not alter mammary gland morphology. These studies demonstrate that LY2066948 produces species-specific, androgen-dependent mammary gland virilism in the female rat.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279543": "Recent clinical data on selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have provided the basis for reassessment of the SERM concept. The molecular basis of SERM activity involves binding of the ligand SERM to the estrogen receptor (ER), causing conformational changes which facilitate interactions with coactivator or corepressor proteins, and subsequently initiate or suppress transcription of target genes. SERM activity is intrinsic to each ER ligand, which accomplishes its unique profile by specific interactions in the target cell, leading to tissue selective actions. We discuss the estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects of early SERMs, such as clomiphene citrate, used for treatment of ovulation induction, and the triphenylethylene, tamoxifen, which has ER antagonist activity in the breast, and is used for prevention and treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. Since the development of tamoxifen, other triphenylethylene SERMs have been studied for breast cancer prevention, including droloxifene, idoxifene, toremifene, and ospemifene. Other SERMs have entered clinical development more recently, including benzothiophenes (raloxifene and arzoxifene), benzopyrans (ormeloxifene, levormeloxifene, and EM-800), lasofoxifene, pipendoxifene, bazedoxifene, HMR-3339, and fulvestrant, an anti-estrogen which is approved for breast cancer treatment. SERMs have effects on tissues containing ER, such as the breast, bone, uterine and genitourinary tissues, and brain, and on markers of cardiovascular risk. Current evidence indicates that each SERM has a unique array of clinical activities. Differences in the patterns of action of SERMs suggest that each clinical end point must be evaluated individually, and conclusions about any particular SERM can only be established through appropriate clinical trials.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930824": "Tamoxifen, a pioneering selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has long been a therapeutic choice for all stages of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. The clinical application of long-term adjuvant antihormone therapy for the breast cancer has significantly improved breast cancer survival. However, acquired resistance to SERM remains a significant challenge in breast cancer treatment. The evolution of acquired resistance to SERMs treatment was primarily discovered using MCF-7 tumors transplanted in athymic mice to mimic years of adjuvant treatment in patients. Acquired resistance to tamoxifen is unique because the growth of resistant tumors is dependent on SERMs. It appears that acquired resistance to SERM is initially able to utilize either E2 or a SERM as the growth stimulus in the SERM-resistant breast tumors. Mechanistic studies reveal that SERMs continuously suppress nuclear ER-target genes even during resistance, whereas they function as agonists to activate multiple membrane-associated molecules to promote cell growth. Laboratory observations in vivo further show that three phases of acquired SERM-resistance exists, depending on the length of SERMs exposure. Tumors with Phase I resistance are stimulated by both SERMs and estrogen. Tumors with Phase II resistance are stimulated by SERMs, but are inhibited by estrogen due to apoptosis. The laboratory models suggest a new treatment strategy, in which limited-duration, low-dose estrogen can be used to purge Phase II-resistant breast cancer cells. This discovery provides an invaluable insight into the evolution of drug resistance to SERMs, and this knowledge is now being used to justify clinical trials of estrogen therapy following long-term antihormone therapy. All of these results suggest that cell populations that have acquired resistance are in constant evolution depending upon selection pressure. The limited availability of growth stimuli in any new environment enhances population plasticity in the trial and error search for survival.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20303261": " Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and brivanib alaninate, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) inhibitor, are two target specific agents that result in a substantial decrease in tumour growth when given alone. Tamoxifen activates SERM stimulated breast and endometrial tumour growth. Tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate have side-effects that can affect therapeutic outcomes. The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lower doses of both agents when given in combination to mice with SERM sensitive, oestrogen stimulated tumour xenografts (MCF-7 E2 tumours). Experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of SERM stimulated breast (MCF-7 Tam, MCF-7 Ral) and endometrial tumours (EnCa 101) to demonstrate the activity of brivanib alaninate in SERM resistant models. In the current study, tumour xenografts were minced and bi-transplanted into the mammary fat pads of athymic, ovariectomised mice. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine an effective oral dose of tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate that had minimal effect on tumour growth. Doses of 125 microg of tamoxifen and 0.05 mg/g of brivanib alaninate were evaluated. An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the two agents together when started at the time of tumour implantation. An additional experiment was done in which tumours were already established and then treated, to obtain enough tumour tissue for molecular analysis. Brivanib alaninate was effective at inhibiting tumour growth in SERM sensitive (MCF-7 E2) and SERM stimulated (EnCa 101, MCF-7 Ral, MCF-7 Tam) models. The effect of the low dose drug combination as an anti-tumour strategy for SERM sensitive (MCF-7 E2) in early treatment was as effective as higher doses of either drug used alone. In established tumours, the combination is successful at decreasing tumour growth, while neither agent alone is effective. Molecular analysis revealed a decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumours that were treated with brivanib alaninate and an increase in VEGFA transcription to compensate for the blockade of VEGFR-2 by increasing the transcription of VEGFA. Tamoxifen increases the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and this effect is abrogated by brivanib alaninate. There was also increased necrosis in tumours treated with brivanib alaninate. Historically, tamoxifen has a role in blocking angiogenesis as well as the blockade of the ER. Tamoxifen and a low dose of an angiogenesis inhibitor, brivanib alaninate, can potentially be combined not only to maximise therapeutic efficacy but also to retard SERM resistant tumour growth.",

Similar to all selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), DT56a demonstrates dual agonistic and antagonistic effects due to the synergy between its components. DT56a is referred to as a plant-origin SERM (phyto-SERM) and, for this reason, its therapeutic capacity in postmenopausal women differs from other phytoestrogens used independently.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19382614": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis is associated with lack of estrogens, therefore, understandably one of the treatment options in osteoporosis is a group of medicines known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). They can act as an estrogen receptor agonist in some tissues, whereas as an antagonist in others. In relation to this antago-antagonistic action, SERMs have a positive effect on bones, the serum lipid profile and the cardio-vascular system. Moreover, they can protect against some estrogen-dependent neoplasm development. The first used SERM was tamoxifen, but due to its negative effect on endometrium it is not indicated in osteoporosis. Raloxifen, which is currently in use, besides the reduction of vertebral fractures risk, has beneficial influence on endometrial and breast neoplasm development risk as well. On the other hand, raloxifen intensifies vasomotor symptoms and its bone-protecting effect is limited. At present, new SERMs (ospemifen, lasofoxifen, bazedoxifen, arzoxifen) are being researched in clinical trials. In the current stage of investigations they reveal beneficial influence on skeletal as well as extraskeletal tissues. Implementation of SERMs in combined therapy of osteoporosis is currently under research as well. SERM with parathormone or SERM with bisphosphonate might prove to be an advantageous treatment option for women with severe or resistant osteoporosis. An addition of SERM to conventional hormonal replacement therapy did not bring the anticipated benefits. Future studies on SERMs may result in new preparations adjusted to individual needs of the patients.",

The long-range goal has been to create dual aromatase inhibitor (AI)/selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The hypothesis is that in normal tissue the estrogenic SERM activity of a dual AI/SERM could attenuate the undesired effects stemming from global estrogen depletion caused by the AI activity of a dual AI/SERM, while in breast cancer tissue the antiestrogenic SERM activity of a dual AI/SERM could act synergistically with AI activity to enhance the antiproliferative effect. The potent aromatase inhibitory activities and high ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2 binding affinities of several of the resulting analogues, together with the facts that they antagonize \u03b2-estradiol in a functional assay in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and they have no E/Z isomers, support their further development in order to obtain dual AI/SERM agents for breast cancer treatment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18637493": "The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and depend on estrogen for growth. Therefore, blocking estrogen mediated actions remains the strategy of choice for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are molecules that block estrogen action in breast cancer, but can still potentially maintain the beneficial effects of estrogen in other tissues, such as bone and cardiovascular system. Tamoxifen, the prototypical drug of this class has been used extensively for the past 30 years to treat and prevent breast cancer. The target of drug action, ERs alpha and beta, are the two receptors which are responsible for the first step in estrogen and SERM action. The SERM binds to the ERs and confers a unique conformation to the complex. In a target site which expresses antiestrogenic actions, the conformation of the ER is distinctly different from estrogen bound ER. The complex recruits protein partners called corepressors to prevent the transcription of estrogen responsive genes. In contrast, at a predominantly estrogenic site coactivators for estrogen action are recruited. Unfortunately at an antiestrogenic site such as breast cancer, long term SERM therapy causes the development of acquired resistance. The breast and endometrial tumor cells selectively become SERM stimulated. Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases, HER-2, EGFR and IGFR and the signaling cascades following their activation are frequently involved in SERM resistant breast cancers. The aberrantly activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways and their cross talk with the genomic components of the ER action are implicated in SERM resistance. Other down stream factors of HER-2 and EGFR signaling, such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK or mTOR pathways has also been found to be involved in resistance mechanisms. Blocking the actions of HER-2 and EGFR represent a rational strategy for treating SERM resistant phenotypes and may in fact restore the sensitivity to the SERMs. Another approach exploits the discovery that low dose estrogen will induce apoptosis in the SERM resistant breast cancers. Numerous clinical studies are addressing these issues.",

We retrospectively evaluated fatty liver development and/or serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation during SERM treatment in 1061 women who were diagnosed and treated with breast cancer in 2005 at Asan Medical Center. 45 of 618 SERM-treated patients with normal ALT at baseline experienced ALT elevation during SERM treatment. Among the 112 SERM-treated patients who underwent liver imaging test, fatty liver was observed in 47 and both fatty liver and ALT elevation developed in 16 of 102 SERM-treated patients with normal baseline ALT. The cumulative rates of ALT elevation (10.7 vs. 4.3%; P = 0.002), fatty liver (48.5 vs. 20.9%; P &lt; 0.001), and both fatty liver and ALT elevation (17.7 vs. 7.1%; P = 0.02) at 60 months were significantly higher in the SERM group than non-SERM group. By multivariate analysis, SERM treatment increased the risk of ALT elevation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.20; P = 0.01), fatty liver development (HR, 3.59; P &lt; 0.001), and both fatty liver and ALT elevation (HR, 4.98; P = 0.01). After discontinuation of SERM, elevated serum ALT normalized in 39 (92.9%) and there were no instances of liver-related death or progression to liver cirrhosis in patients who experienced fatty liver or ALT elevation.

Two different ovariectomized (OVX) models were studied: treatment began immediately post-OVX in one and 3 months post-OVX in the other. Our results showed that n-3 PUFA and both SERMs decreased triglyceride levels in the serum, and that SERMs also decreased serum cholesterol levels while n-3 PUFA had no similar effect. SERMs had no effect on IL-6, IL-1 beta, or IL-10 levels, but they decreased ex vivo tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). N-3 PUFA decreased secretion of non-induced IL-6 and TNF-alpha from cultured BMC and IL-1 beta levels in vivo (i.e., in bone marrow plasma), but its main effect was a significant elevation in the secretion of IL-10, a known anti-inflammatory cytokine. OVX-induced B-lymphopoiesis was not affected by LY-139481 (SERM-I) while LY-353381 (SERM-II) exhibited an estrogen-antagonistic effect in sham and OVX mice and elevated the amount of B-cells in bone marrow. Fish oil consumption prevented the elevation in B-lymphopoiesis caused by OVX, but had no curative effect on established augmented B-lymphopoiesis. This activity could be mediated via the elevation of IL-10 which was shown to suppress B-lymphopoiesis. Both SERMs and n-3 PUFA inhibited the increase in adipose tissue thickness caused by OVX in mice. Our results showed that n-3 PUFA, could prevent some of the deleterious outcomes of estrogen deficiency that were not affected by SERMs. We observed no significant beneficial effects of the combined administration of SERM-I, SERM-II, and PUFA on the studied parameters.The exact mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids exert their activities is still not clear, but peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) might be involved in processes which are modulated by n-3 PUFA.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11046073": "In females, estrogens play a key role in reproduction and have beneficial effects on the skeletal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. Most estrogenic responses are mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs), either ER alpha or ER beta, which are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are ER ligands that in some tissues act like estrogens, but block estrogen action in others. Thus, SERMs may exhibit an agonistic or antagonistic biocharacter depending on the context in which their activity is examined. For example, the SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene both exhibit ER antagonist activity in breast and agonist activity in bone, but only tamoxifen manifests agonist activity in the uterus. Numerous studies have examined the molecular basis for SERM selectivity. Collectively they indicate that different ER ligands induce distinct structural changes in the receptor that influence its ability to interact with other proteins (e.g., coactivators or corepressors) critical for the regulation of target gene transcription. The relative expression of coactivators and corepressors, and the nature of the ER and of its target gene promoter affect SERM biocharacter. Taken together, SERM selectivity reflects the diversity of ER forms and coregulators, cell type differences in their expression, and the diversity of ER target genes. This model provides a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of SERM action, and should help identify new SERMs with enhanced tissue or target gene selectivity.",

Tamoxifen, a failed contraceptive is currently used to treat all stages of breast cancer, chemoprevention in women at high risk for breast cancer and also has beneficial effects on bone mineral density and serum lipids in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene, a failed breast cancer drug, is the only SERM approved internationally for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and vertebral fractures. However, although these SERMs have many benefits, they also have some potentially serious adverse effects, such as thromboembolic disorders and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer. These adverse effects represent a major concern given that long-term therapy is required to prevent osteoporosis or prevent and treat breast cancer. The search for the 'ideal' SERM, which would have estrogenic effects on bone and serum lipids, neutral effects on the uterus, and antiestrogenic effects on breast tissue, but none of the adverse effects associated with current therapies, is currently under way.

We report that the propensity for deamidation by TG2 is both substrate dependent and influenced by the reaction conditions. Direct deamidation is favored for poor substrates and at low concentrations of active TG2, while indirect deamidation (i.e. hydrolysis of transamidated product) can significantly contribute to the deamidation of good peptide substrates at higher enzyme concentrations.

FVC changed over time (p &lt; 0.001), with an average increase of 9.6% predicted (95% CI: 7.2 to 12.1) at 12 months. Weight changed significantly over time (p &lt; 0.001), with an average increase of 4.3 kg (95% CI: 3.0 to 5.6) at 12 months. Although FVC and weight changed significantly over time, there was little correlation between prednisone dose and FVC change, while weight increase correlated significantly with cumulative prednisone dose at 24 months. In patients treated with a high cumulative prednisone dose, baseline FVC was on average lower (p = 0.001) compared to low dose treated patients, while no significant differences were observed in need for second/third-line therapy or number of exacerbations. A strategy leading to a low cumulative dose at 12 months was defined by rapid dose tapering to 10 mg/day within 3.5 months. These results suggest that prednisone therapy aimed at improving or preserving FVC in newly- treated pulmonary sarcoidosis can often be reduced in dose, using a treatment regimen that is characterized by early dose tapering.",

This review will focus specifically on the diagnosis of and therapy for hepatic sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Hepatic involvement of sarcoidosis was described in 11.5% of 736 patients enrolled in the ACCESS study. However, presence alone of granulomas in an organ in sarcoidosis does not dictate treatment. The decision to treat should be based on symptoms and severity of disease. Although hepatic involvement usually is asymptomatic, a minority of patients progress to chronic cholestatic disease, portal hypertension, and cirrhosis that may require liver transplantation. Treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis should be reserved for patients who manifest this spectrum of disease. Glucocorticoid treatment is first-line therapy for hepatic sarcoidosis, improving symptoms and abnormal laboratory values but generally having no effect on progression of disease. In addition to glucocorticoids, immunomodulators such as azathioprine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and infliximab have been used with some positive effects on symptoms, liver enzyme abnormalities, and hepatomegaly, but none has been shown to prevent progression of disease. Ultimately, in cases of overt liver failure, liver transplantation is the definitive treatment. Overall, treatment for hepatic sarcoidosis is targeted toward alleviation of symptoms but has no curative potential at this time.

Evidence defining the best second-line therapeutic is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of methotrexate and azathioprine on prednisone tapering, pulmonary function, and side effects in the second-line treatment of sarcoidosis. An international retrospective cohort study was performed, reviewing all patients with sarcoidosis who started methotrexate or azathioprine until 2 years after initiation or discontinuation. A linear mixed model with FEV1, vital capacity (VC), diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and prednisone dose changes over time as end points was used. Side effects were compared with \u03c72 tests. Two hundred patients were included, of whom 145 received methotrexate and 55 azathioprine. Prednisone daily dose decreased a mean of 6.32 mg/y (P &lt; .0001) while on therapy, with a similar steroid-sparing capacity for methotrexate and azathioprine. Of all patients completing 1 year of therapy, 70% had a reduction in daily prednisone dose of at least 10 mg. FEV1 showed a mean increase of 52 mL/y (P = .006) and VC of 95 mL/y (P = .001) in both treatment groups. DLCO % predicted increased, with a mean of 1.23%/y (P = .018). There were more patients with infections in the azathioprine group (34.6% vs 18.1%, P = .01), but no differences regarding other side effects. This retrospective study comparing the effect of second-line therapy in sarcoidosis shows that both methotrexate and azathioprine have significant steroid-sparing potency, a similar positive effect on lung function, and comparable side effects, except for a higher infection rate in the azathioprine group.",

We propose a step-wise approach to the management of pulmonary disease in sarcoidosis and provide details about how and when to use alternatives to glucocorticoids. The antimetabolites, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, and mycophenolate, are often used as alternatives to steroids.

Corticosteroids are used as first-line treatment in organ-threatening sarcoidosis. In this light, osteoporosis prevention with calcium and vitamin D (CAD) supplementation is often warranted. However, sarcoidosis patients are at risk for hypercalcemia, and CAD supplementation affects the calcium metabolism. We studied calcium and vitamin D disorders in a large cohort of sarcoidosis patients and investigated if CAD supplementation is safe. Retrospectively, data of 301 sarcoidosis patients from July 1986 to June 2009 were analyzed for serum calcium, 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-(OH)D), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2 D), and use of CAD supplementation.

In our study, 5 of the 104 CAD-supplemented patients developed hypercalcemia, but CAD supplementation was not the cause of hypercalcemia. Patients without CAD supplementation were at higher risk for developing hypercalcemia. During CAD supplementation, no hypercalcemia developed as a result of supplementation. Hypovitaminosis D seems to be related with more disease activity of sarcoidosis and, therefore, could be a potential risk factor for disease activity of sarcoidosis.

We investigated distraction as a main emotion regulation strategy before and after DBT in female patients with BPD. Thirty-one BPD patients were instructed to either passively view or memorize letters before being confronted with negative or neutral pictures in a distraction task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. This paradigm was applied before and after a 12-week residential DBT-based treatment program. We compared the DBT group to 15 BPD control patients, who continued their usual, non-DBT-based treatment or did not have any treatment, and 22 healthy participants. Behaviorally, BPD groups and healthy participants did not differ significantly with respect to alterations over time. On the neural level, BPD patients who received DBT-based treatment showed an activity decrease in the right inferior parietal lobe/supramarginal gyrus during distraction from negative rather than neutral stimuli when compared to both control groups. This decrease was correlated with improvement in self-reported borderline symptom severity. DBT responders exhibited decreased right perigenual anterior cingulate activity when viewing negative (rather than neutral) pictures. In conclusion, our findings reveal changes in neural activity associated with distraction during emotion processing after DBT in patients with BPD.

The curriculum objectives are to (1) have psychiatry residents achieve basic understanding of DBT theory and clinical skill, (2) increase residents' ability and confidence in treating self-harm behaviors (both suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury), and (3) enhance residents' willingness to treat individuals with BPD. In addition to a 6-week didactic course on DBT offered to all residents (n = 62), 25 elected to enroll in a year-long DBT clinical training curriculum over the course of a 5-year period. The DBT clinical training consisted of 15 h of additional didactics, ongoing conduct of individual therapy and group DBT skills training, videotaping of individual therapy sessions, and weekly supervision meetings utilizing videotape to provide feedback. Residents participating in the clinical training program videotaped baseline and later sessions, which were rated for DBT adherence. All 62 graduates of the program were surveyed regarding the impact of the training on their practice of psychiatry. Upon graduation, a high percentage (87 % in the curriculum and 70 % in the didactic course only) reported incorporating DBT into their psychiatry practice, as well as willingness and confidence in treating BPD and self-harm behaviors. Residents participating in the clinical training demonstrated significant improvement in their ability to utilize DBT interventions, particularly in structuring sessions, problem assessment, problem solving, and using validation and dialectical strategies. This DBT curriculum was effective in preparing psychiatrists-in-training to incorporate evidence-based practices for effective treatment of BPD and self-harm behaviors and can serve as a model for teaching DBT during psychiatry residency training.

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has proven highly effective in reducing self-harm and improving emotion regulation, whereby problems concerning social cognition, which are also characteristic of BPD, may need additional approaches such as mentalization-based treatment (MBT). Here, we examined, in a pilot study, the effectiveness of MBT given adjunct to DBT, compared to DBT alone, in an inpatient sample with BPD, whereby mentalization was measured using a novel cartoon-based task. Both treatments were highly effective in reducing symptom severity. The combination of DBT and MBT was superior in reducing fearful attachment and in improving affective mentalizing. Mentalization-based treatment in combination with DBT may improve certain aspects of social cognitive skills and attachment security, as compared to DBT alone, although the exact mechanisms that led to these changes need to be studied further. Clinical implications Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can usefully be combined with mentalization-based treatment (MBT). The combination of DBT and MBT reduces self-harm more than DBT alone. DBT plus MBT may lead to a reduction in fearful attachment and improvement of affective mentalizing. Short-term combinations of evidence-based borderline treatments may enrich psychiatric inpatient care. Therefore, such approaches deserve further research.

It is characterized by affective disturbance and impulsivity, which lead to a high number of self-harm behaviors and great amount of health services use. International guidelines recommend psychotherapy as the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder. This paper reviews evidence about the effects and efficacy of cognitive-behavioral oriented psychological treatments for borderline personality disorder. A literature review was conducted in Medline and PubMed databases, using the following keywords: borderline personality disorder, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and efficacy. Sixteen randomized clinical trials were evaluate in this review, which analyzed the effects of several cognitive-behavioral oriented psychotherapeutic interventions, namely dialectical behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, schema-focused therapy and manual-assisted cognitive therapy. All above stated treatments showed clinical beneficial effects, by reducing borderline personality disorder core pathology and associated general psychopathology, as well as by reducing the severity and frequency of self-harm behaviors, and by improving the overall social, interpersonal and global adjustment. Dialectical behavioral therapy and schema-focused therapy also caused a soaring remission rate of diagnostic borderline personality disorder criteria of 57% and 94%, respectively. Although there were differences between the psychotherapeutic interventions analysed in this review, all showed clinical benefits in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. Dialectical behavioral therapy and schema-focused therapy presented the strongest scientific data documenting their efficacy, but both interventions are integrative cognitive-behavioral therapies which deviate from the traditional cognitive-behavioral model. In summary, the available studies support cognitive-behavioral psychological treatments as an efficacious intervention in borderline personality disorder. However, the existing scientific literature on this topic is still scarce and there is need for more studies, with higher methodological rigor, that should validate these results.",

However, the utility of DBT strategies for inpatients with the disorder is unclear. This review summarizes and synthesizes findings from trials of DBT in inpatient settings. Multiple research databases were searched for articles published through June 2011 that reported on any implementation of DBT in an inpatient setting to address symptoms related to borderline personality disorder, including suicidal and self-injurious behavior. Eleven studies that reported pre- and posttreatment symptoms related to borderline personality disorder were evaluated. Studies indicated that many variations of standard DBT have been used in inpatient settings, including approaches that do not include phone consultation, that include group therapy only, and that vary in treatment duration (from two weeks to three months). Most studies reported reductions in suicidal ideation, self-injurious behaviors, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, whereas results for reducing anger and violent behaviors were mixed. Follow-up data indicated that symptom reduction was often maintained between one and 21 months posttreatment. On the basis of the evidence, the authors identify essential components of an inpatient DBT package and discuss its potential function as an \"intensive orientation\" to outpatient DBT services. There is considerable variation in the configuration and duration of DBT implementation for inpatients with borderline personality disorder. However, findings suggest that DBT may be effective in reducing symptoms related to borderline personality disorder in inpatient settings.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21114345": " At present, the most frequently investigated psychosocial intervention for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and long-term effectiveness of DBT. Systematic bibliographic research was undertaken to find relevant literature from online databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, PsychSpider, Medline). We excluded studies in which patients with diagnoses other than BPD were treated, the treatment did not comprise all components specified in the DBT manual or in the suggestions for inpatient DBT programs, patients failed to be diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the intervention group comprised fewer than 10 patients. Using a mixed-effect hierarchical modeling approach, we calculated global effect sizes and effect sizes for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors. Calculations of postintervention global effect sizes were based on 16 studies. Of these, 8 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 8 were neither randomized nor controlled (nRCT). The dropout rate was 27.3% pre- to posttreatment. A moderate global effect and a moderate effect size for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors were found, when including a moderator for RCTs with borderline-specific treatments. There was no evidence for the influence of other moderators (e.g., quality of studies, setting, duration of intervention). A small impairment was shown from posttreatment to follow-up, including 5 RCTs only. Future research should compare DBT with other active borderline-specific treatments that have also demonstrated their efficacy using several long-term follow-up assessment points.",

It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress. The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem-solving. This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them. A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies. Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation. An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels. In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, \"dialectical behavioral therapy\" is a noteworthy model.",

This was a single-blind trial in which 180 patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder who had at least two suicidal or nonsuicidal self-injurious episodes in the past 5 years were randomly assigned to receive 1 year of dialectical behavior therapy or general psychiatric management. The primary outcome measures, assessed at baseline and every 4 months over the treatment period, were frequency and severity of suicidal and nonsuicidal self-harm episodes. Both groups showed improvement on the majority of clinical outcome measures after 1 year of treatment, including significant reductions in the frequency and severity of suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious episodes and significant improvements in most secondary clinical outcomes. Both groups had a reduction in general health care utilization, including emergency visits and psychiatric hospital days, as well as significant improvements in borderline personality disorder symptoms, symptom distress, depression, anger, and interpersonal functioning. No significant differences across any outcomes were found between groups. These results suggest that individuals with borderline personality disorder benefited equally from dialectical behavior therapy and a well-specified treatment delivered by psychiatrists with expertise in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.",

DNA polymerases \u03b1 and \u03b4 carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21278448": "Completion of lagging strand DNA synthesis requires processing of up to 50 million Okazaki fragments per cell cycle in mammalian cells. Even in yeast, the Okazaki fragment maturation happens approximately a million times during a single round of DNA replication. Therefore, efficient processing of Okazaki fragments is vital for DNA replication and cell proliferation. During this process, primase-synthesized RNA/DNA primers are removed, and Okazaki fragments are joined into an intact lagging strand DNA. The processing of RNA/DNA primers requires a group of structure-specific nucleases typified by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). Here, we summarize the distinct roles of these nucleases in different pathways for removal of RNA/DNA primers. Recent findings reveal that Okazaki fragment maturation is highly coordinated. The dynamic interactions of polymerase \u03b4, FEN1 and DNA ligase I with proliferating cell nuclear antigen allow these enzymes to act sequentially during Okazaki fragment maturation. Such protein-protein interactions may be regulated by post-translational modifications. We also discuss studies using mutant mouse models that suggest two distinct cancer etiological mechanisms arising from defects in different steps of Okazaki fragment maturation. Mutations that affect the efficiency of RNA primer removal may result in accumulation of unligated nicks and DNA double-strand breaks. These DNA strand breaks can cause varying forms of chromosome aberrations, contributing to development of cancer that associates with aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangement. On the other hand, mutations that impair editing out of polymerase \u03b1 incorporation errors result in cancer displaying a strong mutator phenotype.",

This nuclease contains two conserved motifs enriched with acidic amino acid residues that are important for catalytic function. Similar motifs have been identified in nucleases found in viruses, archebacteria, eubacteria, and in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans. Unique among these proteins, the putative FEN-1 homologue in Escherichia coli is contained within the N-terminal region of the DNA polymerase I (PolN). To demonstrate that the cellular functions of FEN-1 reside in PolN, we cloned and expressed the amino terminal domain (323 amino acid residues) of PolI in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking the FEN-1 homologue RAD27. Overexpression of PolN suppressed, to varying degrees, phenotypes associated with a rad27 null strain. These include temperature sensitivity, Okazaki fragment processing, a mutator phenotype, a G2/M cell cycle arrest, minichromosome loss, and methyl methane sulfonate sensitivity. We purified Rad27 and PolN proteins in order to determine whether differences in their intrinsic nuclease activities or interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) could explain the partial suppression of some phenotypes. We found that the in vitro nuclease activities of Rad27 were more potent than those of PolN and the activity of Rad27, but not PolN, was stimulated by PCNA. We conclude that the N-terminal nuclease domain of E. coli polymerase I encodes a functional homologue of FEN-1.",

To better understand this process in human cells, we have reconstituted Okazaki fragment processing by the short flap pathway in vitro with purified human proteins and oligonucleotide substrates. We systematically characterized the key events in Okazaki fragment processing: the strand displacement, Pol \u03b4/Fen1 combined reactions for removal of the RNA/DNA primer, and the complete reaction with DNA ligase I. Two forms of human DNA polymerase \u03b4 were studied: Pol \u03b44 and Pol \u03b43, which represent the heterotetramer and the heterotrimer lacking the p12 subunit, respectively. Pol \u03b43 exhibits very limited strand displacement activity in contrast to Pol \u03b44, and stalls on encounter with a 5'-blocking oligonucleotide. Pol \u03b44 and Pol \u03b43 exhibit different characteristics in the Pol \u03b4/Fen1 reactions. While Pol \u03b43 produces predominantly 1 and 2 nt cleavage products irrespective of Fen1 concentrations, Pol \u03b44 produces cleavage fragments of 1-10 nts at low Fen1 concentrations. Pol \u03b43 and Pol \u03b44 exhibit comparable formation of ligated products in the complete system. While both are capable of Okazaki fragment processing in vitro, Pol \u03b43 exhibits ideal characteristics for a role in Okazaki fragment processing. Pol \u03b43 readily idles and in combination with Fen1 produces primarily 1 nt cleavage products, so that nick translation predominates in the removal of the blocking strand, avoiding the production of longer flaps that require additional processing. These studies represent the first analysis of the two forms of human Pol \u03b4 in Okazaki fragment processing. The findings provide evidence for the novel concept that Pol \u03b43 has a role in lagging strand synthesis, and that both forms of Pol \u03b4 may participate in DNA replication in higher eukaryotic cells.",

RNA primers and DNA synthesised by DNA polymerase \u03b1 are displaced by DNA polymerase \u03b4 to create bifurcated nucleic acid structures known as 5'-flaps. These 5'-flaps are removed by Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN), a structure-specific nuclease whose divalent metal ion-dependent phosphodiesterase activity cleaves 5'-flaps with exquisite specificity. FENs are paradigms for the 5' nuclease superfamily, whose members perform a wide variety of roles in nucleic acid metabolism using a similar nuclease core domain that displays common biochemical properties and structural features. A detailed review of FEN structure is undertaken to show how DNA substrate recognition occurs and how FEN achieves cleavage at a single phosphate diester. A proposed double nucleotide unpairing trap (DoNUT) is discussed with regards to FEN and has relevance to the wider 5' nuclease superfamily. The homotrimeric proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein (PCNA) coordinates the actions of DNA polymerase, FEN and DNA ligase by facilitating the hand-off intermediates between each protein during Okazaki fragment maturation to maximise through-put and minimise consequences of intermediates being released into the wider cellular environment. FEN has numerous partner proteins that modulate and control its action during DNA replication and is also controlled by several post-translational modification events, all acting in concert to maintain precise and appropriate cleavage of Okazaki fragment intermediates during DNA replication.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159842": "During DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, short single-stranded DNA segments known as Okazaki fragments are first synthesized on the lagging strand. The Okazaki fragments originate from \u223c35-nucleotide-long RNA-DNA primers. After Okazaki fragment synthesis, these primers must be removed to allow fragment joining into a continuous lagging strand. To date, the models of enzymatic machinery that removes the RNA-DNA primers have come almost exclusively from biochemical reconstitution studies and some genetic interaction assays, and there is little direct evidence to confirm these models. One obstacle to elucidating Okazaki fragment processing has been the lack of methods that can directly examine primer removal <i>in vivo</i> In this study, we developed an electron microscopy assay that can visualize nucleotide flap structures on DNA replication forks in fission yeast (<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>). With this assay, we first demonstrated the generation of flap structures during Okazaki fragment processing <i>in vivo</i> The mean and median lengths of the flaps in wild-type cells were \u223c51 and \u223c41 nucleotides, respectively. We also used yeast mutants to investigate the impact of deleting key DNA replication nucleases on these flap structures. Our results provided direct <i>in vivo</i> evidence for a previously proposed flap cleavage pathway and the critical function of Dna2 and Fen1 in cleaving these flaps. In addition, we found evidence for another previously proposed exonucleolytic pathway involving RNA-DNA primer digestion by exonucleases RNase H2 and Exo1. Taken together, our observations suggest a dual mechanism for Okazaki fragment maturation in lagging strand synthesis and establish a new strategy for interrogation of this fascinating process.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21441898": "During DNA replication, repetitive synthesis of discrete Okazaki fragments requires mechanisms that guarantee DNA polymerase, clamp, and primase proteins are present for every cycle. In Escherichia coli, this process proceeds through transfer of the lagging-strand polymerase from the \u03b2 sliding clamp left at a completed Okazaki fragment to a clamp assembled on a new RNA primer. These lagging-strand clamps are thought to be bound by the replisome from solution and loaded a new for every fragment. Here, we discuss a surprising, alternative lagging-strand synthesis mechanism: efficient replication in the absence of any clamps other than those assembled with the replisome. Using single-molecule experiments, we show that replication complexes pre-assembled on DNA support synthesis of multiple Okazaki fragments in the absence of excess \u03b2 clamps. The processivity of these replisomes, but not the number of synthesized Okazaki fragments, is dependent on the frequency of RNA-primer synthesis. These results broaden our understanding of lagging-strand synthesis and emphasize the stability of the replisome to continue synthesis without new clamps.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20131965": "DNA replication is a primary mechanism for maintaining genome integrity, but it serves this purpose best by cooperating with other proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination. Unlike leading strand synthesis, lagging strand synthesis has a greater risk of faulty replication for several reasons: First, a significant part of DNA is synthesized by polymerase alpha, which lacks a proofreading function. Second, a great number of Okazaki fragments are synthesized, processed and ligated per cell division. Third, the principal mechanism of Okazaki fragment processing is via generation of flaps, which have the potential to form a variety of structures in their sequence context. Finally, many proteins for the lagging strand interact with factors involved in repair and recombination. Thus, lagging strand DNA synthesis could be the best example of a converging place of both replication and repair proteins. To achieve the risky task with extraordinary fidelity, Okazaki fragment processing may depend on multiple layers of redundant, but connected pathways. An essential Dna2 endonuclease/helicase plays a pivotal role in processing common structural intermediates that occur during diverse DNA metabolisms (e.g. lagging strand synthesis and telomere maintenance). Many roles of Dna2 suggest that the preemptive removal of long or structured flaps ultimately contributes to genome maintenance in eukaryotes. In this review, we describe the function of Dna2 in Okazaki fragment processing, and discuss its role in the maintenance of genome integrity with an emphasis on its functional interactions with other factors required for genome maintenance.",

A replication fork has to be a very dynamic apparatus since frequent DNA polymerase switches from the initiating DNA polymerase alpha to the processive elongating DNA polymerase delta occur at the leading strand (about 8 x 10(4) fold on both strands in one replication round) as well as at the lagging strand (about 2 x 10(7) fold on both strands in one replication round) in mammalian cells. Lagging strand replication involves a very complex set of interacting proteins that are able to frequently initiate, elongate and process Okazaki fragments of 180 bp. Moreover, key proteins of this important process appear to be controlled by S-phase check-point proteins. It became furthermore clear in the last few years that DNA replication cannot be considered uncoupled from DNA repair, another very important event for any living organism. The reconstitution of nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair in vitro with purified components clearly showed that the DNA synthesis machinery of both of these macromolecular events are similar and do share many components of the lagging strand DNA synthesis machinery. In this minireview we summarize our current knowledge of the components involved in the execution and regulation of DNA replication at the lagging strand of the replication fork.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19000038": "FENs (flap endonucleases) play essential roles in DNA replication, pivotally in the resolution of Okazaki fragments. In eubacteria, DNA PolI (polymerase I) contains a flap processing domain, the N-terminal 5'--&gt;3' exonuclease. We present evidence of paralogous FEN-encoding genes present in many eubacteria. Two distinct classes of these independent FEN-encoding genes exist with four groups of eubacteria, being identified based on the number and type of FEN gene encoded. The respective proteins possess distinct motifs hallmarking their differentiation. Crucially, based on primary sequence and predicted secondary structural motifs, we reveal key differences at their active sites. These results are supported by biochemical characterization of two family members--ExoIX (exonuclease IX) from Escherichia coli and SaFEN (Staphylococcus aureus FEN). These proteins displayed marked differences in their ability to process a range of branched and linear DNA structures. On bifurcated substrates, SaFEN exhibited similar substrate specificity to previously characterized FENs. In quantitative exonuclease assays, SaFEN maintained a comparable activity with that reported for PolI. However, ExoIX showed no observable enzymatic activity. A threaded model is presented for SaFEN, demonstrating the probable interaction of this newly identified class of FEN with divalent metal ions and a branched DNA substrate. The results from the present study provide an intriguing model for the cellular role of these FEN sub-classes and illustrate the evolutionary importance of processing aberrant DNA, which has led to their maintenance alongside DNA PolI in many eubacteria.",

To assess the in vivo role of the mammalian enzyme in repair and replication, we used a gene-targeting approach to generate mice lacking a functional Fen1 gene. Heterozygote animals appear normal, whereas complete depletion of FEN1 causes early embryonic lethality. Fen1(-/-) blastocysts fail to form inner cell mass during cellular outgrowth, and a complete inactivation of DNA synthesis in giant cells of blastocyst outgrowth was observed. Exposure of Fen1(-/-) blastocysts to gamma radiation caused extensive apoptosis, implying an essential role for FEN1 in the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage in vivo. Our data thus provide in vivo evidence for an essential function of FEN1 in DNA repair, as well as in DNA replication.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14693726": "An initiator RNA (iRNA) is required to prime cellular DNA synthesis. The structure of double-stranded DNA allows the synthesis of one strand to be continuous but the other must be generated discontinuously. Frequent priming of the discontinuous strand results in the formation of many small segments, designated Okazaki fragments. These short pieces need to be processed and joined to form an intact DNA strand. Our knowledge of the mechanism of iRNA removal is still evolving. Early reconstituted systems suggesting that the removal of iRNA requires sequential action of RNase H and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) led to the RNase H/FEN1 model. However, genetic analyses implied that Dna2p, an essential helicase/nuclease, is required. Subsequent biochemical studies suggested sequential action of RPA, Dna2p, and FEN1 for iRNA removal, leading to the second model, the Dna2p/RPA/FEN1 model. Studies of strand-displacement synthesis by polymerase delta indicated that in a reconstituted system, FEN1 could act as soon as short flaps are created, giving rise to a third model, the FEN1-only model. Each of the three pathways is supported by different genetic and biochemical results. Properties of the major protein components in this process will be discussed, and the validity of each model as a true representation of Okazaki fragment processing will be critically evaluated in this review.",

Before adjacent fragments are ligated, any flaps resulting from the displacement of the 5' DNA end of the Okazaki fragment must be cleaved. Previously, Dna2 was implicated to function upstream of flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1 or Rad27) in the processing of long flaps bound by the replication protein A (RPA). Here we show that Dna2 efficiently cleaves long DNA flaps exactly at or directly adjacent to the base. A fraction of the flaps cleaved by Dna2 can be immediately ligated. When coupled with DNA replication, the flap processing activity of Dna2 leads to a nearly complete Okazaki fragment maturation at sub-nanomolar Dna2 concentrations. Our results indicate that a subsequent nucleolytic activity of Fen1 is not required in most cases. In contrast Dna2 is completely incapable to cleave short flaps. We show that also Dna2, like Fen1, interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We propose a model where Dna2 alone is responsible for cleaving of RPA-bound long flaps, while Fen1 or exonuclease 1 (Exo1) cleave short flaps. Our results argue that Dna2 can function in a separate, rather than in a Fen1-dependent pathway.",

Eukaryotic Okazaki fragments remain poorly characterized and, because nucleosomes are rapidly deposited on nascent DNA, Okazaki fragment processing and nucleosome assembly potentially affect one another. Here we show that ligation-competent Okazaki fragments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are sized according to the nucleosome repeat. Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ligation junctions preferentially occur near nucleosome midpoints rather than in internucleosomal linker regions. Disrupting chromatin assembly or lagging-strand polymerase processivity affects both the size and the distribution of Okazaki fragments, suggesting a role for nascent chromatin, assembled immediately after the passage of the replication fork, in the termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis.

Efficient maturation prevents repeat sequence expansions, small duplications, and generation of double-stranded DNA breaks. To address the components required for the process in Thermococcus, Okazaki fragment maturation was reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins from Thermococcus species 9\u00b0N or cell extracts. A dual color fluorescence assay was developed to monitor reaction substrates, intermediates, and products. DNA polymerase D (polD) was proposed to function as the replicative polymerase in Thermococcus replicating both the leading and the lagging strands. It is shown here, however, that it stops before the previous Okazaki fragments, failing to rapidly process them. Instead, Family B DNA polymerase (polB) was observed to rapidly fill the gaps left by polD and displaces the downstream Okazaki fragment to create a flap structure. This flap structure was cleaved by flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) and the resultant nick was ligated by DNA ligase to form a mature lagging strand. The similarities to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems and evolutionary implications of archaeal Okazaki fragment maturation are discussed.",

Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is the central component of the Okazaki fragment maturation pathway. FEN1 cleaves flaps that are displaced by DNA polymerase delta (pol delta), to create a nick that is effectively joined by DNA ligase I. The Pif1 helicase and Dna2 helicase/nuclease contribute to the maturation process by elongating the flap displaced by pol delta. Though the reason for generating long flaps is still a matter of debate, genetic studies have shown that Dna2 and Pif1 are both important components of DNA replication. Our current knowledge of the exact enzymatic steps that govern Okazaki fragment maturation has heavily derived from reconstitution reactions in vitro, which have augmented genetic information, to yield current mechanistic models.

The effects of cytarabine substitution on the structural and thermodynamic properties of a model Okazaki fragment were investigated using UV hyperchromicity and 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine how cytarabine alters the physicochemical properties of Okazaki fragments that are intermediates during DNA replication. Two model Okazaki fragments were prepared corresponding to a primary initiation site for DNA replication in the SV40 viral genome. One model Okazaki fragment consisted of five ribo- and seven deoxyribonucleotides on the hybrid strand, together with its complementary (DNA) strand. The second model Okazaki fragment was identical to the first with the exception of cytarabine substitution for deoxycytidine at the third DNA nucleotide of the hybrid strand. Thermodynamic parameters for the duplex to single strand transition for each model Okazaki fragment were calculated from the concentration dependence of the T m at 260 nm. Cytarabine significantly decreased the stability of this model Okazaki fragment, decreasing the melting temperature from 46.8 to 42.4 degrees C at a concentration of 1.33 x 10(-5) M. The free energy for the duplex to single strand transition was 1.2 kcal/mol less favorable for the cytarabine-substituted Okazaki fragment relative to the control at 37 degrees C. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the imino1H resonances for the two duplexes demonstrated that cytarabine specifically destabilized the DNA:DNA duplex portion of the model Okazaki fragment. These results are consistent with inhibition of lagging strand DNA synthesis by cytarabine substitution resulting from destabilization of the DNA:DNA duplex portion of Okazaki fragments in vivo .",

Class I Okazaki fragments (about 20%) were separated from longer nascent DNA chains by a single phosphodiester bond interruption (nick) and were quantitatively identified by treating purified replicating DNA with Escherichia coli DNA ligase and then measuring the fraction of Okazaki fragments joined to longer nascent DNA chains. Similarly, class II Okazaki fragments (about 30%) were separated by a region of single-stranded DNA template (gap) that could be filled and sealed by T4 DNA polymerase plus E. coli DNA ligase, and class III fragments (about 50%) were separated by RNA primers that could be removed with E. coli DNA olymerase I, allowing the fragments to be joined with E. coli DNA ligase. These results were obtained with replicating SV40 DNA that had been briefly labeled with radioactive precursors in either intact cells or isolated nuclei. When isolated nuclei were further incubated in the presence of cytosol, all of the Okazaki fragments were converted into longer DNA strands as expected for intermediates in DNA synthesis. However, when washed nuclei were incubated in the abscence of cytosol, both class I and class II Okazaki fragments accumulated despite the excision of RNA primers: class III Okazaki fragments and RNA-DNA covalent linkages both disappeared at similar rates. These data demonstrate the existence of RNA primers in whole cells as well as in isolated nuclei, and identify a unique gap-filling step that is not simply an extension of the DNA chain elongation process concomitant with the excision of RNA primers. One or more factos found in cytosol, in addition to DNA polymerase alpha, are specifically involved in the gap-filling and ligation steps. The sizes of mature Okazaki fragments (class I) and Okazaki fragments whose synthesis was completed by T4 DNA polymerase were measured by gel electrophoresis and found to be broadly distributed between 40 and 290 nucleotides with an average length of 135 nucleotides. Since 80% and 90% of the Okazaments does not occur at uniformly spaced intervals along the DNA template. During the excision of RNA primers, nascent DNA chains with a single ribonucleotide covalently attached to the 5' terminus were identified as transient intermediates. These intermediates accumulated during excision of RNA primers in the presence of adenine 9-beta-D-arabinoside 5'-triphosphate, and those Okazaki fragments blocked by RNA primers (class III) were found to have originated the farthest from the 5' ends of long nascent DNA strands. Thus, RNA primers appear to be excised in two steps with the second step, removal of the final ribonucleotide, being stimulated by concomitant DNA synthesis. These and other data were used to construct a comprehensive metabolic pathway for the initiation, elongation, and maturation of Okazaki fragments at mammalian DNA replication forks.",

Salt tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strain IG 3 was isolated from rhizosphere of wheat plants. The isolate IG 3 was able to grow in presence of NaCl ranging from 0 to 20% in Luria Bertani medium. The present study was planned to evaluate the role of inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 and its efficacy in augmenting salt tolerance in oat (Avena sativa) under NaCl stress (100mM). The physiological parameter such as shoot length, root length, shoot dry weight, root dry weight and relative water content (RWC) were remarkably higher in IG 3 inoculated plants in comparison to un-inoculated plants under NaCl stress. Similarly, the biochemical parameters such as proline content, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and activities of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed and found to be notably lesser in IG 3 inoculated oat plants in contrast to un-inoculated plants under salt stress. Inoculation of IG 3 strain to oat seedlings under salt stress positively modulated the expression profile of rbcL and WRKY1 genes. Root colonization of root surface and interior was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy and tetrazolium staining, respectively. Due these outcomes, it could be implicated that inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 enhanced plant growth under salt stress condition. This study demonstrates that PGPR play an imperative function in stimulating salt tolerance in plants and can be used as biofertilizer to enhance growth of crops in saline areas.",

Methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced cross-over study assessed the effects of single doses of the green-oat extract (GOE) across a broad range of cognitive domains in healthy adults aged 40-65 years who self-reported that they felt that their memory had declined with age. Participants attended on six occasions, receiving a single dose of either placebo, 800, or 1600 mg GOE on each occasion, with the counterbalanced order of treatments repeated twice for each participant. Cognitive function was assessed with a range of computerized tasks measuring attention, spatial/working/episodic memory, and executive function pre-dose and at 1, 2.5, 4, and 6 hours post-dose. Results The results showed that 800mg GOE increased the speed of performance across post-dose assessments on a global measure including data from all of the timed tasks. It also improved performance of a delayed word recall task in terms of errors and an executive function task (Peg and Ball) in terms of decreased thinking time and overall completion time. Working memory span (Corsi blocks) was also increased, but only on the second occasion that this dose was taken. Discussion These results confirm the acute cognitive effects of GOE seen in previous research, and suggest that the optimal dose lies at or below 800 mg.",

The quality of 2-DE separation depends on the type of biological material used as a protein source. The presence of interfering compounds (e.g., phenols, as it is the fact in plant material including oat seeds) impedes 2-DE run. With the use of this technique it is possible to analyze the complex protein mixtures, characteristic protein fractions, as well as individual proteins.The purpose of this chapter is to describe the 2-DE technique (the separate stages of the first and the second dimension) for determining the oat protein composition (oat seed proteome), separation and preliminary identification of oat prolamin fractions. Electrophoretically separated proteins are identified on the basis of pI markers (identifying the location of both ends of an IPG strip) and on 2D SDS-PAGE standards. The gel images of oat proteins are analyzed with the help of ImageMaster 2D Platinum 6.0 program (Amersham Bioscience, part of GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). It allows finding unique spot identifiers for the occurrence of oat prolamin fractions in oat total proteins. The characteristic spots of similar shape and intensity (anchoring spots) and characteristic groups of spots can be searched for the purpose of identification.",

These are the A, B, C and D genomes. We have isolated a repeated sequence clone that can be used for the detection of the C genome in Avena by filter hybridization techniques. This clone, termed RS-1, is a genomic DNA clone containing at least one highly repeated sequence that is abundant in Avena species containing the C genome. This sequence or a related sequence is also present, but at much reduced levels, in species that do not contain the C genome. Because of its abundance and the characteristic Southern blot pattern, we have termed this clone a C genome specific clone. We have also done similar analysis of the Avena genus using a rDNA clone from wheat. The results of these experiments demonstrate that clearly definable C genome-specific markers can be identified with both probes. These molecular probes can be useful in studying the genomic relationships of Avena and can provide some clues as to the origin of the cultivated Avena species. These results can, therefore, provide breeders with directions for the efficient transfer of desirable traits of wild Avena species into commencal varieties.",

Their chemical structures were identified by means of electrospray ionization and high-resolution mass spectrometry as well as (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses. Bioassays showed that the five compounds had significant allelopathic effects on the germination and seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The five compounds inhibited fresh wheat as well as the shoot and root growth of wheat by approximately 50% at a concentration of 100 mg/kg, except for tricin and syringoside for shoot growth. The results of activity testing indicated that the aerial parts of wild oats had strong allelopathic potential and could cause different degrees of influence on surrounding plants. Moreover, these compounds could be key allelochemicals in wild-oat-infested wheat fields and interfere with wheat growth via allelopathy.",

The GISH was utilized to detect the interspecific genomic compositions in four hexaploid and two tetraploid oats using total genomic DNA of Avena eriantha (a C-genome diploid) as probe. Intergenomic translocations between A/D and C-genome chromosomes were frequently observed in hexaploid and tetraploid species. In the hexaploid, two pairs of A/D genome segments on C-genome chromosome (A/D-C) translocation and four to six pairs of C-genome segments on A/D genome chromosome (C-A/D) translocation were clearly identified whilst the number of A/D-C translocations was constant among species. In the tetraploid A. maroccana (AACC), a pair of A-C and four pairs of C-A translocations were observed. Moreover, the A/D translocation segments on chromosome 5C was detected only in A. byzantina and A. maroccana, whilst A/D-C translocations were observed on the 1C and 7C of A. sativa, A. fatua and A. sterilis. A. byzantina did however also carry the 1C rearrangement. This result shows that A. byzantina has retained a similar genomic constitution to the tetraploid ancestor of hexaploid oats, A. maroccana. Three pairs of A-C translocations were detected only in A. murphyi (AACC), and two pairs of those were the 1C and 7C as well as the three hexaploid species except A. byzantina.",

The probes used were A. strigosa pAs120a (a repetitive sequence abundant in A-genome chromatin), A. murphyi pAm1 (a repetitive sequence abundant in C-genome chromatin), A. strigosa pITS (internal transcribed spacer of rDNA) and the wheat rDNA probes pTa71 (nucleolus organizer region or NOR) and pTa794 (5S). Simultaneous and sequential FISH employing pairs of these probes allowed the identification and genome assignation of all chromosomes. FISH mapping using mitotic and meiotic metaphases facilitated the genomic and chromosomal identification of the monosome in each line. Of the 17 'Sun II' lines analyzed, 13 distinct monosomic lines were found, corresponding to four monosomes of the A-genome, five of the C-genome and four of the D-genome. In addition, 12 distinct monosomic lines were detected among the 20 'Kanota' lines examined, corresponding to six monosomes of the A-genome, three of the C-genome and three of the D-genome. The results show that 19 chromosomes out of 21 of the complement are represented by monosomes between the two genetic backgrounds. The identity of the remaining chromosomes can be deduced either from one intergenomic translocation detected on both 'Sun II' and 'Kanota' lines, or from the single reciprocal, intergenomic translocation detected among the 'Sun II' lines. These results permit a new system to be proposed for numbering the 21 chromosome pairs of the hexaploid oat complement. Accordingly, the A-genome contains chromosomes 8A, 11A, 13A, 15A, 16A, 17A and 19A; the C-genome contains chromosomes 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C and 7C; and the D-genome consists of chromosomes 9D, 10D, 12D, 14D, 18D, 20D and 21D. Moreover, the FISH patterns of 16 chromosomes in 'Sun II' and 15 in 'Kanota' suggest that these chromosomes could be involved in intergenomic translocations. By comparing the identities of individually translocated chromosomes in the two hexaploid species with those of other hexaploids, we detected different types of intergenomic translocations.",

PCR primers designed from the wheat Lrk10 were used to produce ALrk10 from oat. Two DNA sequences, ALrk1A1 and ALrk4A5, were produced from primers designed from coding and noncoding regions of ALrk10. Their use as RFLP probes indicated that the kinase genes mapped to four loci on different hexaploid oat 'Kanota' x 'Ogle' linkage groups (4_12, 5, 6, and 13) and to a fifth locus unlinked to other markers. Three of these linkage groups contain a region homologous to the short arm of chromosome I of wheat and the fourth contains a region homologous to chromosome 3 of wheat. Analysis with several nullisomics of oat indicated that two of the map locations are on satellite chromosomes. RFLP mapping in a 'Dumont' x 'OT328' population indicated that one map location is closely linked to Pg9, a resistance gene to oat stem rust (Puccinia graminis subsp. avenae). Comparative mapping indicates this to be the region of a presumed cluster of crown rust (Puccinia coronata subsp. avenae) and stem rust resistance genes (Pg3, Pg9, Pc44, Pc46, Pc50, Pc68, Pc95, and PcX).

We measured curvature rates at the early phase of curvature, before it was affected by the drop in SA resulting from the curvature response itself. The plot of the rates against the sines of initial SAs revealed similar curves for oats and wheat, which approached saturation as the sine increased to unity. The two species and previously analyzed rice [Iino et al. (1996) Plant Cell Environ. 19: 1160] appeared to have similar gravisensitivities. Initial SAs below and over 90 degrees yielded comparable rates when the sine values were the same, indicating that the extent of gravitropism is determined by the gravity component perpendicular to the organ's long axis. Long-term curvature kinetics at different SAs indicated that the net curvature rate dropped sharply before the tip reached the vertical position and then the tip approached the vertical slowly, with clear oscillatory movements in the case of wheat. During this late curvature phase, the coleoptile straightened gradually, although none of its parts had yet reached the vertical. When rotated on horizontal clinostats or displaced upwards to reduce SA in the late curvature phase, coleoptiles bent in the opposite direction. These results demonstrated that autotropism counteracts gravitropism to straighten coleoptiles.",

One thousand samples of married women, aged between 20 and 70 years, were studied by conventional Papanicolaou smears. These samples were examined in the Department of Pathology, King Edward Medical University, Lahore from January 2007 to June 2009. Only cases without (pre)neoplastic cytology were included. Six types of infections were diagnosed cytologically. The overall frequency of normal, inadequate, neoplastic, and infective smears was 50%, 1.8%, 10.2%, and 38.3%, respectively. Most of the patients (67%) were in the reproductive age group with mean age 34.7 \u00b1 2.6 years. The commonest clinical sign seen in 354/383 (92%) cases and symptom in (349/383; 91%) cases were vaginal discharge and pruritis vulvae. Among the infective smears, 290 cases (75.7%), the cytologic diagnosis was nonspecific inflammation. Most of these 290 smears contained clue cells (indicating Gardnerella infection) and a lack of lactobacilli. Such smears are predominant in patients suffering from bacterial vaginosis (BV). Twenty-eight smears (7.3%) were positive for Trichomonas vaginalis, 27 cases (7%) were smears with koilocytic change pathognomonic of human papilloma virus infection. Twenty-five smears (6.5%) were positive for fungal infection. Seven cases (1.8%) were diagnosed as herpes simplex virus infection. Finally, there were six cases (1.5%) with atrophic vaginitis. We conclude that the cervical smear is well suited for diagnosing cervical infections.

Positive criteria for a Gram stain included greater than 10 white blood cells per high-power field, gram-negative intracellular/extracellular diplococci (suggesting N gonorrhoeae), clue cells (suggesting T vaginalis), or direct visualization of T vaginalis organisms. DNA probes were used as the gold standard definition for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infection. Of 1511 initially eligible ED visits, 941 were analyzed (genital Gram stain and DNA probe results both present), with a prevalence of either C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae of 11.4%. A positive genital Gram stain was 75.7% sensitive and 43.3% specific in diagnosing either C trachomatis and/or N gonorrhoeae infection, and 80.4% sensitive and 32.2% specific when the positive cutoff was lowered to more than 5 white blood cells/high-power field. No Gram stains were positive for T vaginalis (with 47 positive wet mounts), and clue cells were noted on 117 Gram stains (11.6%).

University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. Samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). Genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. Group B streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. Vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. Also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. Aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group B streptococci and E. coli. Its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. The most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. In theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.",

Depopulation of lactobacilli from the normal vaginal flora and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic species are the presumed etiology. To date, no scientific evidence shows that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. Malodorous vaginal discharge is the most common symptom. Differential diagnoses include trichomoniasis, moniliasis, and allergic or chemical dermatitis. The diagnosis is confirmed when at least three of the following four findings are present (Amsel's criteria): 1) thin, homogenous discharge, 2) pH greater than 4.5, 3) positive amine test, and 4) presence of clue cells. The sensitivity and positive predictive value are both 90%. Vaginal Gram stain is also reliable and allows for permanent record. Cultures are nonspecific because G. vaginalis resides in normal vaginal flora as well. Papanicolaou smears are not particularly sensitive, but their positive predictive value is very high. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend three treatment regimens in nonpregnant patients: oral metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), intravaginal 2% clindamycin cream (one applicatorful at bedtime for 7 days), or intravaginal metronidazole gel (one to two applicatorfuls per day for 5 days). Alternative regimens include a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole or a 7-day course of oral clindamycin, 300 mg twice daily. The association between bacterial vaginosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes has satisfied many criteria for a causal inference.

While fourth generation antigen-antibody combination assays have been successful in high-resource settings, rapid point of care (POC) versions of these assays have yet to demonstrate high sensitivity to detect AHI. Newer RNA/DNA based POC technologies are being validated, but the challenge to understand the additional value of these devices depends on the quality of study evaluations, in particular choice of study designs and case mix of included populations. In this commentary, we aimed to review the quality of studies evaluating a new fourth generation rapid test for detecting AHI, to identify general methodological limitations and biases in diagnostic accuracy studies, and to recommend strategies for avoiding them in future evaluations. The new studies that were evaluated continued to report the same weaknesses and biases that were seen in previous evaluations of fourth generation rapid tests. We recommend that investigators design future studies carefully, keeping in mind how diagnostic performance may be influenced by prevalence, population, patient case mixes, and reference standards. Care must be taken to avoid biases specific to diagnostic accuracy studies (spectrum, verification, incorporation and reference standard biases).

Antibody negative and RNA positive sera were also tested by a laboratory 4th generation HIV Ab/Ag enzyme immunoassay. Reference testing yielded 97 positives for HIV infection and 36 negative samples. Sensitivity of the Alere test was 95% (88-98%), while the SD Bioline sensitivity was 91% (83-96%). Both assays showed 100% (90-100%) specificity. No indeterminate or invalid results were recorded. Among 13 samples with acute infection (HIV RNA positive, HIV antibody negative), 12 were found positive by the first assay and 8 by the second. The antigen component of the Alere assay detected 10 acute samples, while the SD Bioline assay detected only one. Both rapid assays showed very good overall performance in detecting HIV infection in frozen serum samples, but further improvements are required to improve the performance in acute infection.",

However, multiple factors, including improper implementation of testing strategies and clerical errors, have been reported to lead to HIV misdiagnosis. The World Health Organization has recommended HIV retesting prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation which has become pertinent with scaling up of Early Access to ART for All (EAAA). In this analysis, misdiagnosed clients are identified from a subgroup of clients enrolled in EAAA implementation study in Swaziland. The subgroup to assess misdiagnosis was identified from enrolled EAAA study clients, who had an undetectable viral load prior to ART initiation between September 1, 2014 and May 31, 2016. One hundred and five of 2533 (4%) clients had an undetectable viral load prior to initiation to ART (pre-ART). The HIV status of clients was confirmed using the Determine HIV 1/2 and Uni-Gold HIV 1/2 rapid tests performed serially as recommended by the national testing algorithm. The status of clients on ART was additionally confirmed by fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combo tests, Architect and Genscreen Ultra. Fourteen of the 105 (13%) clients were false positive (HIV negative) on confirmation testing, of whom five (36%) were still in pre-ART care, while nine (64%) were in ART care. Overall, proportion of false positive was 0.6% (14/2533). The false-positive clients had a median CD4 of 791 cells/ml (interquartile range (IQR): 628, 967) compared to 549 cells/ml (IQR: 387, 791) for true positives (HIV positive) (<i>p</i> = 0.0081) and were nearly 20 years older (<i>p</i> = 0.0008). Overall 0.6% of all enrolled EAAA clients were misdiagnosed, and 64% of misdiagnosed clients were initiated on ART. With adoption of EAAA guidelines by national governments, ART initiation regardless of immunological criteria, strengthening of proficiency testing and adoption of retesting prior to ART initiation would allow identification of misdiagnosed clients and further reduce potential of initiating misdiagnosed clients on ART.",

We discuss implications of the findings on rapid HIV testing programmes. Cross-sectional design: Following enrolment into the survey, questionnaires were administered to eligible and consenting participants in order to obtain demographic and HIV-related data. Peripheral blood samples were collected for HIV-related testing. Participants were offered community-based HIV testing in the home by trained field workers using a serial algorithm with two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in series. In the laboratory, reference HIV testing was conducted using two fourth-generation immunoassays with all positives in the confirmatory test considered true positives. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and false-positive and false-negative rates were determined. Of 10,236 individuals enrolled in the survey, 3740 were tested in the home (median age 24 years (interquartile range 19-31 years), 42.1% males and HIV positivity on RDT algorithm 8.0%). From those tested, 3729 (99.7%) had a definitive RDT result as well as a laboratory immunoassay result. The overall accuracy of the RDT when compared to the fourth-generation immunoassays was 98.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 98.5-99.2). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 91.1% (95% CI 87.5-93.7), 99.9% (95% CI 99.8-100), 99.3% (95% CI 97.4-99.8) and 99.1% (95% CI 98.8-99.4) respectively. The false-positive and false-negative rates were 0.06% (95% CI 0.01-0.24) and 8.9% (95% CI 6.3-12.53). Compared to true positives, false negatives were more likely to be recently infected on limited antigen avidity assay and to report antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. The overall accuracy of the RDT algorithm was high. However, there were few false positives, and the sensitivity was lower than expected with high false negatives, despite implementation of quality assurance measures. False negatives were associated with recent (early) infection and ART exposure. The RDT algorithm was able to correctly identify the majority of HIV infections in community-based HIV testing. Messaging on the potential for false positives and false negatives should be included in these programmes.",

It is a rarely reported life threatening complication of an acute HIV infection, with only ten documented case reports per our literature search. We present a case of HLH secondary to acute HIV infection with a negative HIV antibody-based assay and high plasma viral load. A 45 year old male with a past medical history of well controlled hypertension presented with fever, dizziness and non-bloody diarrhea. Initial lab work revealed a new thrombocytopenia, marked renal failure and an elevated creatine kinase, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer. A bone marrow biopsy revealed HLH. As part of the work up for thrombocytopenia, a rapid HIV antibody based assay was done and was negative. The sample was later routinely tested with a fourth generation antigen/antibody assay as per local protocol and was strongly positive. The plasma RNA viral load was &gt;10,000,000 copies /mL confirming the diagnosis of an acute HIV infection. The patient was urgently started on antiretroviral therapy and recovered. This case illustrates a diagnostic approach to HLH which is an uncommon but life threatening multisystem disease, requiring the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of experts. Following any diagnosis of HLH, rapid identification and treatment of the underlying condition is critical. A negative rapid HIV antibody test can be misleading in the context of early HIV infection and the additional use of fourth generation antigen/antibody test or plasma RNA viral load may be required within the right clinical context for diagnosis.",

We report the case of a seronegative HIV-infected man who despite clinical and laboratory findings of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,repeatedly tested nonreactive to third-generation HIV enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and Western blot testing. Serologic diagnosis in this case required fourth-generation EIA testing due to the seronegativity of standard testing. The fourth-generation HIV EIA was positive presumably because it detects p24 HIV antigen as well as antibodies, unlike rapid HIV tests and third-generation HIV EIAs.This case highlights not only the importance of frontline providers to understand the different testing methodologies for HIV screening and their limitations but the importance of clinical suspicion as well.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11595590": " The routine HIV screening essentially depends on the detection of HIV specific antibodies. However, HIV p24 antigen can be detected in individuals with recent HIV infection about 2-18 days prior to seroconversion. New fourth generation HIV screening assays combine the detection of anti-HIV antibodies with the simultaneous detection of HIV p24 antigen. This may result in a reduction of the diagnostic window after primary infection. The performance of two novel fourth generation assays in routine diagnostic was evaluated. We compared two third generation, two fourth generation and one antigen HIV assays in a case with acute primary HIV infection. In our case, the HIV infection was detected 11 days earlier with the fourth generation assays compared to third generation assays. Interestingly, after the initial reactive results the fourth generation assays became negative resulting in a second diagnostic window. During this second diagnostic window neither third nor fourth generation HIV assays were reactive. This second diagnostic window was caused by the absence of HIV specific antibodies and the decline of HIV p24 antigen concentrations below the detection limits of the fourth generation assays. Fourth generation assays markedly improve the diagnosis of recent HIV infections but the possibility of a second diagnostic window must be considered.",

The first HIV antibody test, developed in 1985, was designed to screen blood products, not to diagnose AIDS. The first-generation assays detected IgG antibody and became positive 6 to 12 weeks postinfection. False-positive results occurred; thus, a two-test algorithm was developed using a Western blot or immunofluorescence test as a confirmatory procedure. The second-generation HIV test added recombinant antigens, and the third-generation HIV tests included IgM detection, reducing the test-negative window to approximately 3 weeks postinfection. Fourth- and fifth-generation HIV assays added p24 antigen detection to the screening assay, reducing the test-negative window to 11 to 14 days. A new algorithm addressed the fourth-generation assay's ability to detect both antibody and antigen and yet not differentiate between them. The fifth-generation HIV assay provides separate antigen and antibody results and will require yet another algorithm. HIV infection may now be detected approximately 2 weeks postexposure, with a reduced number of false-positive results.",

Forty-eight patients with de Quervain's disease who did not respond to conservative treatment were operated with two different incisions. The patients were followed at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months to compare the surgical outcomes. During a three-month follow-up, a significant difference was shown between the two methods (p = 0.0001). Results of surgical treatment with longitudinal incision were better (only one hypertrophic scar), but there were 12 postoperative complications with transverse incision. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the hypertrophic scar. In transverse incision group, out of five patients, four patients who developed hypertrophic scar have poor score according to VAS.

Different tests have been described in the past, the most popular test being the Eichhoff's test, often wrongly named as the Finkelstein's test. Over the years, a misinterpretation has occurred between these two tests, the latter being confused with the first. To compare the Eichhoff's test with a new test, the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test, we set up a prospective study over a period of three years for a cohort of 100 patients (88 women, 12 men) presenting spontaneous pain over the radial side of the styloid of the radius (de Quervain tendinopathy). The purpose of the study was to compare the accuracy of the Eichhoff's test and wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test to diagnose correctly de Quervain's disease by comparing clinical findings using those tests with the results on ultrasound. The wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test revealed greater sensitivity (0.99) and an improved specificity (0.29) together with a slightly better positive predictive value (0.95) and an improved negative predictive value (0.67). Moreover, the study showed us that the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test is very valuable in diagnosing dynamic instability after successful decompression of the first extensor compartment. Our results support that the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test is a more precise tool for the diagnosis of de Quervain's disease than the Eichhoff's test and thus could be adopted to guide clinical diagnosis in the early stages of de Quervain's tendinopathy.",

A literature search was performed to compare our results. In the literature we found supportive evidence that accurate injection of triamcinolone in the first dorsal compartment of the wrist is important for a good outcome. In this retrospective study we found that treatment with ultrasound-guided injections of triamcinolone is both safe and effective. After two injections, 91% of the patients had good long-term results, which is a higher cure rate than found in most other studies. Furthermore, we found that Finkelstein's test can give a false positive result. Therefore, ultrasound should not only be considered to improve the treatment outcome, but can also be useful as a diagnostic tool in the management of de Quervain's disease.",

The authors report a retrospective study of 20 patients who have been treated by a longitudinal surgical approach. The mean age was 49 years old with a net female predominance.

The sheath palmar flap has been sutured with skin (Le Viet plasty) to avoid a further tendons luxation. At three years follow-up, the functional results were good in all the patients. However, non-aesthetic scars were noticed in three patients. We did not notice neither a case of anesthesia of the radial nerve nor a tendinous luxation in our series. The stenosing tenosynovitis of the first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist is a relatively frequent pathology in the young woman.

Randomised and controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. After screening abstracts of studies identified by the search we obtained full text articles of studies which fulfilled the selection criteria. We extracted data using a predefined electronic form. We assessed the methodological quality of included trials by using the checklist developed by Jadad and the Delphi list. We extracted data on the primary outcome measures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial styloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of Finkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection treatment. We found one controlled clinical trial of 18 participants (all pregnant or lactating women) that compared one steroid injection with methylprednisolone and bupivacaine to splinting with a thumb spica. All patients in the steroid injection group (9/9) achieved complete relief of pain whereas none of the patients in the thumb spica group (0/9) had complete relief of pain, one to six days after intervention (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.2). No side effects or local complications of steroid injection were noted. The efficacy of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis has been studied in only one small controlled clinical trial, which found steroid injections to be superior to thumb spica splinting.

Finkelstein hypothesized that the entry of the muscle bellies of the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL) tendons into the first extensor compartment was responsible for the findings observed in his now eponymous test. We agree with Finkelstein's hypothesis and further hypothesize that this position would induce measurable bulk (muscle mass within the retinaculum) and tethering (stretching of synovial tissue) effects within the compartment. To test this latter hypothesis we measured the excursion and gliding resistance of the EPB and APL tendons within the first compartment. Fifteen fresh-frozen cadavers were used. Gliding resistance and excursion were measured in 4 different wrist positions, including the wrist position of Finkelstein's test (30 degrees ulnar deviation). The bulk and tethering effect was calculated based on the mean gliding resistance over the tendon proximal/distal excursion cycle and the gliding resistance at the terminal distal excursion. The EPB tendon excursion was significantly more distal in 30 degrees ulnar deviation than in 60 degrees extension. Additionally the bulk and tethering resistance was significantly greater in 30 degrees ulnar deviation compared with 60 degrees extension. For the APL tendon there was no significant difference in either the tendon excursion or the bulk and tethering resistance between 30 degrees ulnar deviation and 60 degrees extension. We showed that in the position of Finkelstein's test the EPB tendon is significantly more distal and has significantly greater bulk and tethering effect compared with the other EPB positions. This is not the case for the APL tendon in the position of Finkelstein's test. These results suggest that an abnormal Finkelstein's test reflects differences of the EPB more than it does the APL.",

Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC. We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs.

However, the last few years have witnessed the realization that a large class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), named microRNAs, contribute to cancer development and progression by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing of microRNAs with tumor suppressor features by CpG island hypermethylation is a common hallmark of human tumors. Thus, we wondered whether there were other ncRNAs undergoing aberrant DNA methylation-associated silencing in transformed cells. We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types. Our finding that, in addition to microRNAs, another class of ncRNAs (T-UCRs) undergoes DNA methylation-associated inactivation in transformed cells supports a model in which epigenetic and genetic alterations in coding and non-coding sequences cooperate in human tumorigenesis.",

Disability was caused by occupational injuries and comorbidities, both of which occurred with greater frequency in miners with coal workers' pneumoconiosis than in controls.

It agrees that the approach does not provide universalisable methods either for resolving such moral dilemmas arising from conflict between the principles or their derivatives, or universalisable methods for resolving disagreements about the scope of these principles-long acknowledged lacunae but arguably to be found, in practice, with all other approaches to medical ethics. The value of the approach, when properly understood, is to provide a universalisable though prima facie set of moral commitments which all doctors can accept, a basic moral language and a basic moral analytic framework. These can underpin an intercultural 'moral mission statement' for the goals and practice of medicine.",

These principles are held to be expansive enough to provide the basis for the ethical practice of medicine across cultures. Although principlism remains subject to critique and revision, the four-principle model continues to be taught and applied across the world. As the practice of medicine globalizes, it remains critical to examine the extent to which both the four-principle framework, and individual principles among the four, suffice patients and practitioners in different social and cultural contexts. Using the four-principle model we analyze two accounts of surrogate decision making - one from the developed and one from the developing world - in which the clinician undertakes medical decision-making with apparently little input from the patient and/or family. The purpose of this analysis is to highlight challenges in assessing ethical behaviour according to the principlist model. We next describe cultural expectations and mores that inform both patient and clinician behaviors in these scenarios in order to argue that the principle of respect for persons informed by culture-specific ideas of personhood may offer an improved ethical construct for analyzing and guiding medical practice in a globalized and plural world.",

The four-principles approach, as espoused by Beauchamp and Childress, is also interpreted through the prism of Islamic ethical theory. Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm. This will provide an important insight into Islamic medical ethics, enabling the clinician to have a better informed discussion with the Muslim patient. It will also allow for a higher degree of concordance in consultations and consequently optimise culturally sensitive healthcare delivery.",

Chinese aesthetic surgical ethics provide valuable guidance for the practice of aesthetic medicine. Adherence to the ethics of Chinese aesthetic surgery provides an essential guide for the practice of aesthetic medicine in China.

This study tests whether these principles can be quantitatively measured on an individual level, and then subsequently if they are used in the decision making process when individuals are faced with ethical dilemmas. The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as a tool for the measurement of the principles. Four scenarios, which involved conflicts between the medical ethical principles, were presented to participants who then made judgments about the ethicality of the action in the scenario, and their intentions to act in the same manner if they were in the situation. Individual preferences for these medical ethical principles can be measured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This technique provides a useful tool in which to highlight individual medical ethical values. On average, individuals have a significant preference for non-maleficence over the other principles, however, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this preference does not seem to relate to applied ethical judgements in specific ethical dilemmas. People state they value these medical ethical principles but they do not actually seem to use them directly in the decision making process. The reasons for this are explained through the lack of a behavioural model to account for the relevant situational factors not captured by the principles. The limitations of the principles in predicting ethical decision making are discussed.",

Despite wide acceptance, there is controversy about the meaning and use of the principles in clinical practice as a checklist for moral behaviour. Recent attempts by medical regulatory authorities to use the four principles to judge medical practitioner behaviour have not met with success in clarifying how these principles can be incorporated into a legal framework. This may reflect the philosophical debate about the relationship between law and morals. In this paper, legal decisions from two cases in which general practitioners have been charged with professional shortcomings are discussed. Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted. The four principles are relevant to medical practitioner behaviour, but if applied as justifications for disciplinary decisions without explanation, perverse results may ensue. Solutions are suggested to minimise ambiguities in the application of the four principles: adjudicators should acknowledge the difference between professional and common morality and the statutory requirement to give decisions with reasons.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937467": "Tom Beauchamp and James Childress have always maintained that their four principles approach (otherwise known as principlism) is a globally applicable framework for biomedical ethics. This claim is grounded in their belief that the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice form part of a 'common morality', or collection of very general norms to which everyone who is committed to morality subscribes. The difficulty, however, has always been how to demonstrate, at least in the absence of a full-blooded analysis of the concept of morality, whether the four principles are foundational, and so globally applicable, in this way. In the recently published sixth edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics, an imaginative and non-question-begging empirical method of determining the common morality's norms is suggested. In this paper, I outline this method, before arguing that it is difficult to see how it might be thought to achieve its purpose.",

The principle of beneficence - that one should act in the child's interests - is complicated by difficulties in assessing what a child's interests are and to which standard of interests those choosing for children should be held.

However, conflicts between the different principles are commonplace in psychiatric practice, especially in forensic psychiatry, where duties to patients often conflict with duties to third parties such as the public. This article seeks to highlight some of the specific ethical dilemmas encountered in forensic psychiatry: the excessive use of segregation for the protection of others, the ethics of using mechanical restraint when clinically beneficial and the use of physical treatment without consent. We argue that justice, as a principle, should be paramount in forensic psychiatry, and that there is a need for a more specific code of ethics to cover specialised areas of medicine like forensic psychiatry. This code should specify that in cases of conflict between different principles, justice should gain precedence over the other principles.",

Authors have included in this review the most relevant manuscripts regarding diagnosis and treatment of DFO. After review and critical analysis of publications, it may be concluded that diagnosis of DFO is not simple because of its heterogeneous presentation. Clinical inflammatory signs, probe-to-bone test, and plain X-rays are postulated as the basic tests for clinical diagnosis when DFO is suspected. Diagnosis should be supported by laboratory tests, of which ESR (&gt;70mm/h) has been shown to be most precise. MRI is the most accurate imaging test, especially for differential diagnosis with Charcot foot. Pathogen isolation by bone culture is essential when the patient is treated with ATB only.

One of the key areas of morbidity associated with diabetes is the diabetic foot. To improve the care of patients with diabetic foot and to provide an evidence-based multidisciplinary management approach, the Society for Vascular Surgery in collaboration with the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Society for Vascular Medicine developed this clinical practice guideline. The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. This was based on five systematic reviews of the literature. Specific areas of focus included (1) prevention of diabetic foot ulceration, (2) off-loading, (3) diagnosis of osteomyelitis, (4) wound care, and (5) peripheral arterial disease. Although we identified only limited high-quality evidence for many of the critical questions, we used the best available evidence and considered the patients' values and preferences and the clinical context to develop these guidelines. We include preventive recommendations such as those for adequate glycemic control, periodic foot inspection, and patient and family education. We recommend using custom therapeutic footwear in high-risk diabetic patients, including those with significant neuropathy, foot deformities, or previous amputation. In patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), we recommend off-loading with a total contact cast or irremovable fixed ankle walking boot. In patients with a new DFU, we recommend probe to bone test and plain films to be followed by magnetic resonance imaging if a soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis is suspected. We provide recommendations on comprehensive wound care and various d\u00e9bridement methods. For DFUs that fail to improve (&gt;50% wound area reduction) after a minimum of 4 weeks of standard wound therapy, we recommend adjunctive wound therapy options. In patients with DFU who have peripheral arterial disease, we recommend revascularization by either surgical bypass or endovascular therapy. Whereas these guidelines have addressed five key areas in the care of DFUs, they do not cover all the aspects of this complex condition. Going forward as future evidence accumulates, we plan to update our recommendations accordingly.",

For each patient we did a probe-to-bone test at the time of the initial evaluation and then obtained plain X-rays of the involved foot. All patients with positive results on either the probe-to-bone test or plain X-ray underwent an appropriate surgical procedure, which included obtaining a bone specimen that was processed for histology and culture. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of the procedures, using the histopathological diagnosis of osteomyelitis as the criterion standard. Overall, 72.4% of patients had histologically proven osteomyelitis, 85.2% of whom had positive bone culture.

We searched for systematic reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes to compare its performance with the reference standard. MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and March 2007 related to osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes. Additional articles were identified through a hand search of references from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and polling experts. Original studies were selected if they (1) described historical features, physical examination, laboratory investigations, or plain radiograph in the diagnosis of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes mellitus, (2) data could be extracted to construct 2 x 2 tables or had reported operating characteristics of the diagnostic measure, and (3) the diagnostic test was compared with a reference standard. Of 279 articles retrieved, 21 form the basis of this review. Data from a single high-quality meta-analysis were used to summarize the diagnostic characteristics of MRI in osteomyelitis. Two authors independently assigned each study a quality grade using previously published criteria and abstracted operating characteristic data using a standardized instrument. The gold standard for diagnosis is bone biopsy. No studies were identified that addressed the utility of the history in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. An ulcer area larger than 2 cm2 (positive likelihood ratio [LR], 7.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-49; negative LR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.76) and a positive \"probe-to-bone\" test result (summary positive LR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.6-11; negative LR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.76) were the best clinical findings.

Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects. To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017. We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence).Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings. The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.",

If drug-induced, it can be an isolated phenomenon, but it may also accompany or follow a cutaneous phototoxicity reaction due to drug intake and exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. Photo-onycholysis is a rare photosensitivity reaction due to exposure to either a natural or artificial source of light. Many drugs are responsible for this phototoxic reaction, especially tetracyclines, psoralens, chloramphenicol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, and, rarely, doxycycline. Any patient given enough of a therapeutic dose of an inducing drug and sufficient light irradiation can develop phototoxic reactions. While there is no need to avoid these drugs completely, precautions should be taken. Here we have reported the case of a patient who developed onycholysis of his fingernails with sparing of the toenails following administration of diclofenac therapy for lower back pain. The onycholysis was associated with a phototoxic reaction. The swellings resolved totally within two days, and the patient started to notice the separation of all fingernail plates from their nail beds. The patient was treated symptomatically. On follow-up, onycholysis had regressed slowly, and the condition recovered totally within three months without any sequelae.",

Our objective was to create an assay for determining doxycycline levels and to use hair samples for monitoring the compliance over a longer period of time. We tested sera and hair samples from patients treated with doxycycline by a suitable ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) based assay. We estimated that the speed of hair growth is roughly 1.25 cm per month and we were able to determine doxycycline levels over a 6-month period. We tested 14 patients treated with doxycycline and we found similar levels of doxycycline in the serum and the hair samples representing the last 4 months. Linear regression analysis revealed that the level of doxycycline in the serum remained stable over time (p = 0.7) but the level of doxycycline in the hair decreased significantly over time (p = 0.03) indicating a degradation of this molecule in the hair. We detected two patients who did not have antibiotic in the hair, indicating a lack of compliance that was also confirmed by interview. Hair samples can be used to test long-term compliance in patients to explain failures or relapses.",

However, the use of this antibiotic is often connected with the risk of phototoxic reactions that lead to various skin disorders. One of the factors influencing the photosensitivity reactions is the melanin content in melanocytes. In this study, the impact of doxycycline and UVA irradiation on cell viability, melanogenesis and antioxidant defense system in cultured normal human epidermal melanocytes (HEMn-DP) was examined. The exposure of cells to doxycycline and UVA radiation resulted in concentration-dependent loss in melanocytes viability and induced melanin biosynthesis. Significant changes were stated in cellular antioxidant enzymes activity: SOD, CAT and GPx, which indicates alterations of antioxidant defense system. The results obtained in vitro may explain the mechanisms of phototoxic reactions that occur in normal human epidermal melanocytes in vivo after exposure of skin to doxycycline and UVA radiation.",

Patients with symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement are often treated with courses of intravenous ceftriaxone. This is an expensive treatment approach with potentially severe side effects. We compared the efficacy, side effects and costs of doxycycline and ceftriaxone in the treatment of such patients. Adult patients qualified for the study if they had nonspecific symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement for more than six months (but without overt clinical signs of the involvement), had positive serum borrelial antibody titers and/or erythema migrans prior to the onset of symptoms, had not been previously treated with antibiotics and did not have pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients were given either 100 mg of oral doxycycline twice daily for 4 weeks (23 patients) or 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone daily for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for another 2 weeks (23 patients). Clinical outcome was assessed during a 12-month follow-up period. Improvement in the frequency and/or the intensity of symptoms was reported by more than two-thirds of the 46 patients enrolled in the study. The two treatment regimens were found to be correspondingly effective. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline proved to be much cheaper than with ceftriaxone. In patients with previously untreated chronic Lyme borreliosis with symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement but without overt clinical signs of it, and without pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, treatment with doxycycline is as effective as with ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone.",

This retrospective study compares the monochromatic irradiation results in 11 patients with CAD and 14 patients with drug-induced photosensitivity, to assess whether such testing is useful in the differentiation of these two conditions. Thus, the action spectra of the drug photosensitivity patients were plotted and compared with those of 12 nonphotosensitive control patients: 10 patients were found to be photosensitive in the UVA range; the implicated drugs included quinine, sparfloxacin, amiodarone, doxycycline, mefenamic acid, nalidixic acid, fenbrufen, diclofenac, enalapril, diltiazem and prochlorperazine maleate. One patient on doxycycline was photosensitive in both the UVA and UVB ranges. The remaining three patients were not tested until after discontinuation of their drug and their light tests were then normal. In the CAD group, five patients were photosensitive in the UVA, UVB and visible light ranges and six were photosensitive in the UVA and UVB ranges. Comparison of the mean minimal erythema dose responses then demonstrated dissociation of the drug-induced from the CAD group in the UVB region; the result was statistically significant. This suggests that UVA-sensitivity dissociated from UVB-sensitivity is a relative indicator of drug-induced photosensitivity and monochromatic irradiation testing may therefore be helpful in the differentiation of these two disorders.",

Topical and oral antibiotics have been used to treat rosacea; however, high-dose antibiotics or long-term, low-dose antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of rosacea flares or for rosacea maintenance therapy, respectively, can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms. The first oral medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rosacea in the United States is Oracea (CollaGenex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Newtown, PA, USA). Oracea is a 40 mg capsule of doxycycline monohydrate, containing 30 mg immediate-release and 10 mg delayed-release doxycycline beads (\"anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline\"). Anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is not an antibiotic and does not lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Each capsule of anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline contains a total of 40 mg of anhydrous doxycycline as 30 mg of immediate-release and 10 mg of delayed-release beads. In contrast to other oral therapies, anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is taken once daily, which may increase treatment compliance. The results of two phase III trials have been encouraging, leading to the recent release (summer 2006) of Oracea for the treatment of rosacea in the United States. Anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or increased photosensitivity, or by pregnant or nursing women (anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is a pregnancy category-D medication). The risk of permanent teeth discoloration and decreased bone growth rate make anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline contraindicated in infants and children. However, when used appropriately in patients with rosacea, anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline may help prolong the effectiveness and life span of our most precious antibiotics.",

A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with NSAGU treated in a private dermogynecology practice. A total of 26 girls and women with NSAGU were identified and divided into 2 groups: group A = 17 patients with moderate to severe ulceration treated in the acute stage with oral corticosteroid; and group B = 9 patients with mild ulceration treated in the acute stage with topical corticosteroid. Patients in group A, with a mean age of 27.9 years (range, 11-62 years), were treated with oral prednisolone commencing with 15 to 50 mg per day depending on severity. Sixteen (94%) achieved rapid pain relief and complete healing of ulcers within 16 days. Eight (47%) commenced doxycycline prophylaxis. Women in group B, with a mean age of 42.5 years (range, 26-67 years) were treated with topical corticosteroids. Eight (89%) had a history of recurrent ulcers and 6 (66%) commenced doxycycline prophylaxis. Of all 14 patients on doxycycline prophylaxis, none reported any recurrences during a mean follow-up of 18.3 months. There were no adverse effects caused by prednisolone. One patient experienced mild photosensitivity from doxycycline but continued to take it. This was a retrospective case series from a single private practice-based population.

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the impairment of neuronal information processing remain poorly understood in temporal lobe epilepsy. Within the hippocampal formation neuronal networks undergo major reorganization, including the sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus; they establish aberrant recurrent synapses between dentate granule cells and operate via postsynaptic kainate receptors. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that this aberrant local circuit alters information processing of perforant path inputs constituting the major excitatory afferent pathway from entorhinal cortex to dentate granule cells. Experiments were performed in dentate granule cells from control rats and rats with temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine hydrochloride treatment. Neurons were recorded in patch clamp in whole cell configuration in hippocampal slices. Our present data revealed that an aberrant readout of synaptic inputs by kainate receptors triggered a long-lasting impairment of the perforant path input-output operation in epileptic dentate granule cells. We demonstrated that this is due to the aberrant activity-dependent potentiation of the persistent sodium current altering intrinsic firing properties of dentate granule cells. We propose that this aberrant activity-dependent intrinsic plasticity, which lastingly impairs the information processing of cortical inputs in dentate gyrus, may participate in hippocampal-related cognitive deficits, such as those reported in patients with epilepsy.",

In the current study, 6\u2011day\u2011old Sprague\u2011Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (CONT) and recurrent neonatal seizure (RS) groups. On postnatal day 35 (P35), mossy fiber sprouting and gene expression were assessed by Timm staining and reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Of the twenty genes investigated, seven were significantly downregulated, while four were significantly upregulated in the RS group compared with CONT rats, which was observed in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex. Meanwhile, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting was observed in the supragranular region of the dentate gyrus and Cornu Ammonis 3 subfield of the hippocampus in the RS group. In addition, linear correlation analysis identified significant associations between the expression of certain genes in the hippocampus, which accounted for 40% of the total fifty\u2011five gene pairs among the eleven regulated genes. However, only eight gene pairs in the cerebral cortex exhibited significant positive associations, which accounted for 14.5% of the total. The results of the present study indicated the importance of hippocampal Zn/lipid metabolism\u2011associated genes in recurrent neonatal seizure\u2011induced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which may aid the identification of novel potential targets during epileptogenesis.",

Here we examined if mossy cells exhibit long-term plasticity in the posttraumatic, hyperexcitable dentate gyrus. Mossy cells 1 wk after fluid percussion head injury did not show alterations in their current-firing frequency (I-F) and current-membrane voltage (I-V) relationships. In spite of the unchanged I-F and I-V curves, mossy cells showed extensive modifications in Na(+), K(+) and h-currents, indicating the coordinated nature of these opposing modifications. Computational experiments in a realistic large-scale model of the dentate gyrus demonstrated that individually, these perturbations could significantly affect network activity. Synaptic inputs also displayed systematic, opposing modifications. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes were decreased, whereas miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitudes were increased as expected from a homeostatic response to network hyperexcitability. In addition, opposing alterations in miniature and spontaneous synaptic event frequencies and amplitudes were observed for both EPSCs and IPSCs. Despite extensive changes in synaptic inputs, cannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was not altered in posttraumatic mossy cells. These data demonstrate that many intrinsic and synaptic properties of mossy cells undergo highly specific, long-term alterations after traumatic brain injury. The systematic nature of such extensive and opposing alterations suggests that single-cell properties are significantly influenced by homeostatic mechanisms in hyperexcitable circuits.",

Through these feed-back excitatory connections, mossy cells have been suggested to play important roles in both normal signal processing in learning and memory, as well as in seizure propagation. However, the nature of the activity-dependent modifications of the mossy fiber inputs to mossy hilar cells is not well understood. We studied the long- and short-term plasticity properties of the mossy fiber-mossy cell synapse, using the minimal stimulation technique in slices in whole cell recorded mossy cells retrogradely prelabeled with the fluorescent dye DiO from the contralateral dentate gyrus. Following tetanic stimulation, mossy fiber synapses showed significant NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP), associated with increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) amplitude and decreased failure rates. Coefficient of variance and failure rate analyses suggested a presynaptic locus of LTP induction. Mossy fiber synapses on mossy cells also showed activity-dependent short-term modification properties, including both frequency-dependent facilitation (stimuli at higher frequencies evoked larger EPSCs with lower failure rates) and burst facilitation (each EPSC in a burst had a larger amplitude and higher probability of occurrence than the preceding EPSCs within the burst). The data show that mossy fiber-mossy cell synapses exhibit both long- and short-term plasticity phenomena that are generally similar to the mossy fiber synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells.",

Multiple tetrode recordings, supported by juxtacellular recording techniques, showed that granule cells fired very sparsely, whereas mossy cells in the hilus fired promiscuously in multiple locations and in multiple environments.

All patients were treated nonoperatively on a physiotherapy routine. Average followup was 2.6 years. Patients were clinically examined and subjected to KT-1000 and Cybex testing. All patients were able to return to their previous activity and experienced no limitations with their injured knees. Using Hughston's criteria, subjective and functional ratings were all good. However, only 3 rated good and 10 fair when assessed objectively. We conclude that acceptable functional stability in these patients does not necessarily require absolute static stability.

Ichthyosiform sarcoidosis has a predilection for dark-skinned races, and cases affecting Japanese patients have rarely been reported in English literature. We herein describe three Japanese cases of ichthyosiform sarcoidosis on the lower limbs. All of the patients were female, with an age range of 57-69 years old. Histologically, sarcoidal granulomas were located in the mid- to lower dermis. All cases had scar sarcoidosis on the knees. Furthermore, Case 1 presented with papular sarcoidosis on the back, and Case 3 presented with subcutaneous nodules on the buttock as well as erythema nodosum-like lesions on the lower legs. All patients had lung sarcoidosis, but ocular sarcoidosis was seen in only Case 2. Case 3 showed Heerfordt syndrome with facial nerve paralysis. Histological features showed that the granular layers were scarcely detected in the overlying epidermis; however, filaggrin expression was not decreased. Sarcoidal granulomas accumulated around the sweat glands in one case, whereas those features were not detected in the other two cases.

A cadaver of a mature female was imaged by MRI using specific sequences as the Spin-echo (SE) T1-weighting and Gradient-echo (GE) STIR T2-weighting sequences in sagittal, dorsal and transverse planes, with a magnet of 0.2 Tesla. The bony and articular structures were identified and labelled on anatomical dissections, as well as on the magnetic resonance (MR) images. MR images showed the bone, articular cartilage, menisci and ligaments of the normal tiger stifle. SE T1-weighted sequence provided excellent resolution of the subchondral bones of the femur, tibia and patella compared with the GE STIR T2-weighted MR images. Articular cartilage and synovial fluid were visualised with high signal intensity in GE STIR T2-weighted sequence, compared with SE T1-weighted sequence where they appeared with intermediate intensity signal. Menisci and ligaments of the stifle joint were visible with low signal intensity in both sequences. The infrapatellar fat pad was hyperintense on SE T1-weighted images and showed low signal intensity on GE STIR T2-weighted images. MRI provided adequate information of the bony and soft tissues structures of Bengal tiger stifle joints. This information can be used as initial anatomic reference for interpretation of MR stifle images and to assist in the diagnosis of diseases of this region.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634932": "Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization.",

To perform a comprehensive analysis of paralogous testis-biased genes, we characterized the testes transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster by comparing gene expression in testes vs. ovaries, heads, and gonadectomized males. A number of the identified 399 testis-biased genes code for the known components of mature sperm. Among the detected 69 genes downregulated in testes, a large fraction is required for viability. By analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified \"co-regulated\" paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, \"anti-regulated\" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and \"neutral\" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other constitutively expressed. The numbers of identified co-regulated and anti-regulated pairs were higher than expected by chance. Testis-biased genes included in these pairs show decreased frequency of lethal mutations, suggesting their specific role in male reproduction. These genes also show exceptionally high interspecific variability of expression in comparison between D. melanogaster and the closely related D. simulans. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.",

MiRNAs tune entire biological pathways, spanning stress reactions, by regulating the stability and/or translation of their targets. MiRNA genes are often subject to co-evolutionary changes together with their target transcripts, which may be reflected by differences between paralog mouse and primate miRNA/mRNA pairs. However, whether such evolution occurred in stress-related miRNAs remained largely unknown. Here, we report that the stress-induced evolutionarily conserved miR-132-3p, its target transcripts and its regulated pathways provide an intriguing example to exceptionally robust conservation. Mice and human miR-132-3p share six experimentally validated targets and 18 predicted targets with a common miRNA response element. Enrichment analysis and mining in-house and web-available experimental data identified co-regulation by miR-132 in mice and humans of stress-related, inflammatory, metabolic, and neuronal growth pathways.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20482863": " Genome amplification through duplication or proliferation of transposable elements has its counterpart in genome reduction, by elimination of DNA or by gene inactivation. Whether loss is primarily due to excision of random length DNA fragments or the inactivation of one gene at a time is controversial. Reduction after whole genome duplication (WGD) represents an inexorable collapse in gene complement. We compare fifteen genomes descending from six eukaryotic WGD events 20-450 Mya. We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. Descendant genomes of the same WGD event behave as replicates. Choice of paralog pairs to be reduced is random except for some resistant regions of contiguous pairs. For those paralog pairs that are reduced, conserved copies tend to concentrate on one chromosome. Both the contiguous regions of reduction-resistant pairs and the concentration of runs of single copy genes on a single chromosome are evidence of transcriptional co-regulation, dosage sensitivity or other functional interaction constraining the reduction process. These constraints and their evolution over time show a consistent pattern across evolutionary domains and a highly reproducible pattern, as replicates, for the several descendants of a single WGD.",

Our methodology, which we denote 'COgnate Gene Expression patterNing in tumours' (COGENT), unmasked numerous genes that were differentially expressed in multiple cancers. COGENT detected well-known tumor-associated (TA) genes such as TP53, EGFR and VEGF, as well as many multi-cancer, but not-yet-tumor-associated genes. In addition, we identified 81 co-regulated regions on the human genome (RIDGEs) by using expression data from all cancers. Some RIDGEs (28%) consist of paralog genes while another subset (30%) are specifically dysregulated in tumors but not in normal tissues. Furthermore, a significant number of RIDGEs are associated with GC-rich regions on the genome. All assembled data is freely available online (www.oncoreveal.org) as a tool implementing COGENT analysis of multi-cancer genes and RIDGEs.

A \"master\" promoter, located about 2 kb downstream of hoxb5a, controls transcription of a pre-mRNA comprising exon sequences of both genes. This unique gene structure is proposed to provide a novel mechanism to ensure overlapping, tissue-specific expression of both genes in the posterior hindbrain and spinal cord. Transgenic approaches were used to analyze the functions of zebrafish hoxb3a/hoxb4a promoters and enhancer sequences containing regions of homology that were previously identified by comparative genomics. Two neural enhancers were shown to establish specific anterior expression borders within the hindbrain and mediate expression in defined neuronal populations derived from hindbrain rhombomeres (r) 5 to 8, suggesting a late role of the genes in neuronal cell lineage specification. Species comparison showed that the zebrafish hoxb3a r5 and r6 enhancer corresponded to a sequence within the mouse HoxA cluster controlling activity of Hoxa3 in r5 and r6, whereas a homologous region within the HoxB cluster activated Hoxb3 expression but limited to r5. We conclude that the similarity of hoxb3a/Hoxa3 regulatory mechanisms reflect the shared descent of both genes from a single ancestral paralog group 3 gene.",

This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, including guidelines from Germany and abroad. Children and adolescents with IBD often have extensive involvement and an aggressive course of disease. Nonetheless, infliximab and adalimumab are the only biological agents that have been approved for this group of patients. In Crohn's disease, exclusive enteral nutrition is the treatment of first choice for inducing a remission. Patients with (peri-)anal fistulae are treated primarily with infliximab. Corticosteroids and aminosalicylates should be used with caution. In contrast, children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis are treated with either aminosalicylates or prednisolone to induce a remission. As a rule, maintenance pharmacotherapy with thiopurines in Crohn's disease and severe ulcerative colitis, or with aminosalicylates in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, is indicated for several years, at least until the end of puberty. Patients with refractory disease courses are treated with methylprednisolone, anti-TNF-\u03b1-antibodies, and/or calcineurin inhibitors. The spectrum of surgical interventions is the same as for adults. Specific aspects of the treatment of children and adolescents with IBD include adverse drug effects, the areas of nutrition, growth, and development, and the structured transition to adult medicine. Children and adolescents with IBD or suspected IBD should be cared for by pediatric gastroenterologists in a center where such care is provided. Individualized treatment with multidisciplinary, family-oriented longterm care is particularly important. Drug trials in children and adolescents are needed so that the off-label use of drugs to patients in this age group can be reduced.",

Two other TNF inhibitors recently have demonstrated efficacy in CD: certolizumab pegol and adalimumab. The Food and Drug Administration has approved adalimumab for use in RA. One predicts that these agents also may have activity in the extraintestinal manifestation for IBD. To determine whether future biologics are effective in the EIM of IBD, one may need to look no further than the vast clinical trial experience in primary chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints and skin: RA and psoriasis. For example, the Food and DRug Administration recently has approved an anti-B-cell therapy, rituximab, and a T-cell costimulation modulator, abatacept, for use in RA.

Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for induction and maintenance of remission of CD and UC. The role of infliximab for EIMs related to IBD has been less studied, but it is likely as effective. The EIMs may run a course that parallels IBD activity or may present separately. The EIMs that parallel intestinal inflammation (eg, peripheral arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, and episcleritis) generally respond to infliximab. Therefore, treating patients with IBD who have one of these EIMs will more often than not improve the EIM. The EIMs that run a separate course from IBD are more difficult to treat. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have variable responses to IBD medications. Infliximab is efficacious for uveitis and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AS. The efficacy of infliximab for PSC is unknown. The dosing schedule of infliximab for IBD patients with EIMs should be induction doses with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks followed by every 8 weeks.

With the introduction of biosimilar drugs, including the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13, the therapeutic landscape in IBD will change. Access to biological drugs will widen and patients will be treated earlier. The division between 'conventional' and 'biological' therapy will be replaced by new treatment paradigms.

The incidence of new brain infarctions was significantly lower in the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-only group (22 patients [5.7%] vs. 20 patients [11.3%]; relative risk, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.91; P=0.04), but the incidence of silent brain infarction did not differ significantly between the study groups (P=0.97). Serious adverse events occurred in 23.1% of the patients in the PFO closure group and in 27.8% of the patients in the antiplatelet-only group (P=0.22). Serious device-related adverse events occurred in 6 patients (1.4%) in the PFO closure group, and atrial fibrillation occurred in 29 patients (6.6%) after PFO closure. Among patients with a PFO who had had a cryptogenic stroke, the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke was lower among those assigned to PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone; however, PFO closure was associated with higher rates of device complications and atrial fibrillation.

Aims The Gore REDUCE Clinical Study (REDUCE) aims to establish superiority of patent foramen ovale closure in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy over antiplatelet therapy alone in reducing the risk of recurrent clinical ischemic stroke or new silent brain infarct in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke. Methods and design This controlled, open-label trial randomized 664 subjects with cryptogenic stroke at 63 multinational sites in a 2:1 ratio to either antiplatelet therapy plus patent foramen ovale closure (with GORE\u00ae HELEX\u00ae Septal Occluder or GORE\u00ae CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder) or antiplatelet therapy alone. Subjects will be prospectively followed for up to five years. Neuroimaging is required for all subjects at baseline and at two years or study exit. Study outcomes The two co-primary endpoints for the study are freedom from recurrent clinical ischemic stroke through at least 24 months post-randomization and incidence of new brain infarct (defined as clinical ischemic stroke or silent brain infarct) through 24 months. The primary analyses are an unadjusted log-rank test and a binomial test of subject-based proportions, respectively, both on the intent-to-treat population, with adjustment for testing multiplicity. Discussion The REDUCE trial aims to target a patient population with truly cryptogenic strokes. Medical therapy is limited to antiplatelet agents in both arms thereby reducing confounding. The trial should determine whether patent foramen ovale closure with the Gore septal occluders is safe and more effective than medical therapy alone for the prevention of recurrent clinical ischemic stroke or new silent brain infarct; the neuroimaging data will provide an opportunity to further support the proof of concept. The main results are anticipated in 2017. Registration Clinical trial registration-URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00738894.",

Therefore, statistical algorithms to perform spatial, genome-wide correlation among genomic features are required. Here, we propose a method, StereoGene, that rapidly estimates genome-wide correlation among pairs of genomic features. These features may represent high-throughput data mapped to reference genome or sets of genomic annotations in that reference genome. StereoGene enables correlation of continuous data directly, avoiding the data binarization and subsequent data loss. Correlations are computed among neighboring genomic positions using kernel correlation. Representing the correlation as a function of the genome position, StereoGene outputs the local correlation track as part of the analysis. StereoGene also accounts for confounders such as input DNA by partial correlation. We apply our method to numerous comparisons of ChIP-Seq datasets from the Human Epigenome Atlas and FANTOM CAGE to demonstrate its wide applicability. We observe the changes in the correlation between epigenomic features across developmental trajectories of several tissue types consistent with known biology and find a novel spatial correlation of CAGE clusters with donor splice sites and with poly(A) sites. These analyses provide examples for the broad applicability of StereoGene for regulatory genomics.

Those fractions which contained older red cells disclosed a pyruvate-kinase instability which resulted in impaired metabolism. Changes in membrane lipid composition as indicated by increased cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were also detected in patients during the acute phase of ZS. Alcohol-induced red-cell vitamin-E deficiency with a decrease in PUFA levels may provoke an oxidation of reduced red-cell glutathione which in turn results in the enzyme instability.

Studies of biochemical properties of PK such as thermostability, Michaelis-Menten constants, and activation and inhibition tests brought results markedly deviating from the norm.-Fractions containing old cells particularly disclosed PK instability. A defective red cell matabolism resulted which was measurable through ATP-instability, altered glucose utilization and lactate production. - Experimental cell aging procedures led to a markedly decreased red cell metabolism.

The impact of comorbidities (psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression) on relative importance scores of each attribute was assessed by analyses of variance, post hoc test, and multivariate regression analysis. Among the participants included (58.9% males, mean age 49.3 yrs), 27% suffered from psoriatic arthritis, 13.5% from cardiovascular disease, 8% from diabetes, and 12.9% from depression. Preferences for treatment attributes varied significantly depending on comorbidities.

The association of psoriasis and its comorbidity can be partly explained by genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms. Approximately 40 psoriasis susceptibility loci have been described with the majority linked to the innate and adaptive immune system. In some associated diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis, an overlap of their genetic susceptibility exists. Pathophysiologically the \"psoriatic march\" is a model that describes the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases due to the presence of underlying systemic inflammation.

A meeting including rheumatologists, dermatologists, trainees/fellows, and invited experts was held to develop consensus-based recommendations using a Delphi process with prespecified cutoff agreement. Level of agreement was measured using a 10-point Likert scale (1 = no agreement, 10 = full agreement) and the potential effect of recommendations on daily clinical practice was considered. Grade of recommendation (ranging from A to D) was determined according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine evidence levels.

In RA, depressive symptoms (\u03b2 = -0.29) and concern about the consequences of the arthritis (\u03b2 = -0.27) were independent correlates of physical HRQOL. These findings suggest strongly that psychological factors are important correlates of HRQOL in PsA as well as in RA.

A total of 495 patients were included, 42.8% were women and median (SD) age was 50.4 (12.7) years. Prevalence of symptoms of anxiety were 29.7% and prevalence of symptoms of depression was 17,6%. Patients with anxiety or depression symptoms had all EQ-5D dimensions affected (p&lt;0.01). Higher prevalence of anxiety was related to being a woman, a mixed onset pattern with respect to peripheral joints and those treated with DMARD alone with respect to DMARD+NSAID or biologic alone. A higher depression prevalence was related to being a woman and a mixed onset pattern with respect to peripheral joints. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and the prevalence of depression symptoms are high among patients suffering psoriatic arthritis in the studied population.",

Comorbidities in Pso include psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reduced quality of life, malignancy, depression, but also a constellation of associated conditions that enhance the cardiovascular (CV) risk. Indeed, obesity is common in patients with Pso or PsA and is considered to be a risk factor for the onset of these diseases. Patients with Pso and PsA share common obesity-related complications such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), dyslipidemia, diabetes or insulin resistance, and CV diseases. Chronic inflammation in Pso and PsA partially explains the development of atherosclerosis and CV diseases. In parallel, body composition is disturbed in patients with Pso or PsA, as suggested by anthropometric measurements, while an excess of abdominal adiposity is observed in PsA, enhancing the risk of MetS and CV diseases. Adipokines may link the adipose tissue to the obesity-related complications of Pso and PsA. Indeed, altered circulating levels of the adipokines leptin, adiponectin, visfatine, and resistin have been found in patients with Pso or PsA. In addition, an excess of adipose tissue may compromise the therapeutic response to traditional drugs or biological agents in Pso and PsA. This paper reviews the comorbidities that contribute to enhanced CV risk, the body composition results, and the potential role of adipokines in systemic inflammation and energetic balance in Pso and PsA.",

Despite good control of the disease when applying appropriate treatments (according to disease severity, insurance parameters, patient preference, and patients' ability to adhere), continued advancements will allow even better symptomatic control, reduced adverse effects, and patient satisfaction. This review aims to assess traditional and new psoriasis treatments and how to apply them in clinical practice. A literature review on psoriasis treatments and clinical applications was performed using PubMed. Mild-to-moderate psoriasis treatments include topicals, localized phototherapy, and newer therapies combining two types of topicals, phototherapy with topicals, and easy-to-use foam and spray vehicles. Moderate-to-severe psoriasis therapies include monotherapy or various combinations of generalized phototherapy, oral treatments, and biologic agents, with new oral and biologic agents on the horizon. Dermatologists and primary care providers share roles in screening for associated comorbidities (including cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney disease, Crohn disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus/insulin resistance, depression, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and psoriatic arthritis), managing patients' treatments, and reevaluating treatment needs as new therapies are approved. Continued advancements in psoriasis treatment and improvement in coordinated care will allow better overall care of patients with psoriasis.",

Subsequently, the balance between exonucleolytic deadenylation and selective re-establishment of translation-competent poly(A) tails by cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases is essential for the appropriate regulation of gene expression from oocytes to neurons. In recent years, surprising roles for cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase-related enzymes that add uridylyl, rather than adenylyl, residues to RNA 3' ends have also emerged. These terminal uridylyl transferases promote the turnover of certain mRNAs but also modify microRNAs, their precursors and other small RNAs to modulate their stability or biological functions.",

Here we show that polyadenylated 3' termini in three yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Debaryomyces hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the average yeast gene has an \"end zone,\" a &gt;200 bp window with &gt;60 distinct poly(A) sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D. hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors.",

In the first section of our review, we consider the classical process of mRNA 3'-terminus formation, which involves the cleavage of the transcript synthesized by RNA polymerase II and the associated poly(A) tail synthesis by canonical polyadenylate polymerase. Nucleotide sequences needed for mRNA cleavage and poly(A) tail synthesis, in particular the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal, as well as numerous proteins and their complexes involved in mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, is described in detail. The significance of the poly(A) tail for prolonging mRNA lifetime and stimulating their translation is discussed. Data presented in the second section demonstrate that RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III from certain SINEs (Short Interspersed Elements) can undergo AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation. The structural and functional features of RNA polymerase III determine the unusual character of polyadenylation of RNAs synthesized by this enzyme. The history of recent developments in this area of study have been described in greater detail, in particular the discovery of AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation of RNA synthesized by RNA polymerase III, which has not been discussed previously. Data on AAUAAA-independent polyadenylation catalyzed by noncanonical TRAMP poly(A)-polymerases (Trf4 and Trf5) have been presented in the third section. These enzymes promote rapid degradation of RNAs by adding a short poly(A) tail to them. This mechanism enables the recognition, poly(A)-marking, and elimination of incorrectly folded noncoding transcripts (e.g. ribosomal and transfer RNAs).",

Polyadenylation is essential for eukaryotic mRNA expression, and CstF-64 is a subunit of the CstF polyadenylation factor that is required for accurate polyadenylation. We discovered that there are two forms of the CstF-64 protein in mammalian male germ cells, one of which (CstF-64) is expressed in all tissues, the other of which (tauCstF-64) is expressed only in male germ cells and in brain (albeit at significantly lower levels in the brain). Therefore, we were surprised to find that, using reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA cloning, and RNA blot analyses, tauCstF-64 mRNA was expressed at higher levels in brain than in testis. Also, tauCstF-64 mRNA was expressed at lower but detectable levels in all tissues tested, including epididymis, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, ovary, spleen, thymus, and uterus. These results suggest the hypothesis that tauCstF-64 mRNA is regulated at the translational or post-translational level.",

To further characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in plant mitochondrial mRNA degradation, we have analyzed the polyadenylation and degradation processes of potato atp9 mRNAs. The overall majority of polyadenylation sites of potato atp9 mRNAs is located at or in the vicinity of their mature 3'-extremities. We show that a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20-30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. The addition of as few as seven non-adenosine nucleotides 3' to the poly(A) tail is sufficient to almost completely inhibit the in vitro degradation of the RNA substrate. Interestingly, the exoribonuclease activity proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures present in RNA substrates. From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3' ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3'- to 5'- degradation process.",

The sites of polyadenylation of bacterial mRNA are diverse and include the 3'-ends of primary transcripts, the sites of endonucleolytic processing in the 3' untranslated and intercistronic regions, and sites within the coding regions of mRNA degradation products. The diversity of polyadenylation sites suggests that mRNA polyadenylation in prokaryotes is a relatively indiscriminate process that can occur at all mRNA's 3'-ends and does not require specific consensus sequences as in eukaryotes. Two poly(A) polymerases have been identified in Escherichia coli. They are encoded by unlinked genes, neither of which is essential for growth, suggesting significant functional overlap. Polyadenylation promotes the degradation of a regulatory RNA that inhibits the replication of bacterial plasmids and may play a similar role in the degradation of mRNA. However, under certain conditions, poly(A) tracts may lead to mRNA stabilization. Their ability to bind S1 ribosomal protein suggests that poly(A) tracts may also play a role in mRNA translation.",

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mature poly(A) tail ranges from 60 to 70 nucleotides. 3'-end processing can be reproduced in vitro with purified factors. The cleavage reaction requires cleavage factors I and II (CF I and CF II), whereas polyadenylation involves CF I, polyadenylation factor I (PFI), and poly(A) polymerase (Pap1p). CF I has recently been separated into two factors, CF IA and CF IB. We have independently purified CF IA and found that five polypeptides cofractionate with the activity. They include Rna14p, Rna15p, Pcf11p, a new protein called Clp1p, and remarkably, the major poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p. Extracts from strains where the PAB1 gene is mutated or deleted are active for cleavage but generate transcripts bearing abnormally long poly(A) tracts. Complementation with recombinant Pab1p not only restores the length of the poly(A) tails to normal, but also triggers a poly(A) shortening activity. In addition, a monoclonal Pab1p antibody prevents the formation of poly(A) tails in extracts or in a reconstituted system. Our data support the notion that Pab1p is involved in the length control of the poly(A) tails of yeast mRNAs and define a new essential function for Pab1p in the formation of mature mRNAs.",

We have now determined that sequences downstream of the core U-rich element (URE) form a fundamental part of mammalian polyadenylation signals. These novel AUX DSEs all influenced the efficiency of 3'-end processing in vitro by stabilizing the assembly of CstF on the core downstream URE. Three possible mechanisms by which AUX DSEs mediate efficient in vitro 3'-end processing have been explored. First, AUX DSEs can promote processing efficiency by maintaining the core elements in an unstructured domain which allows the general polyadenylation factors to efficiently assemble on the RNA substrate. Second, AUX DSEs can enhance processing by forming a stable structure which helps focus binding of CstF to the core downstream URE. Finally, the GRS element, but not the binding site for the bacteriophage R17 coat protein, can substitute for the auxiliary downstream region of the adenovirus L3 polyadenylation signal. This suggests that AUX DSE binding proteins may play an active role in stimulating 3'-end processing by stabilizing the association of CstF with the RNA substrate. AUX DSEs, therefore, serve as a integral part of the polyadenylation signal and can affect signal strength and possibly regulation.",

These microorganisms mostly control protein synthesis by posttranscriptional regulation processes, like mRNA stabilization and degradation. Transcription in these cells is polycistronic. Tens to hundreds of protein-coding genes of unrelated function are arrayed in long clusters on the same DNA strand. Polycistrons are cotranscriptionally processed by trans-splicing at the 5' end and polyadenylation at the 3' end, generating monocistronic units ready for degradation or translation. In this work, we show that some trans-splicing/polyadenylation sites may be skipped during normal polycistronic processing. As a consequence, dicistronic units or monocistronic transcripts having long 3' UTRs are produced. Interestingly, these unspliced transcripts can be processed into mature mRNAs by the conventional trans-splicing/polyadenylation events leading to translation. To our knowledge, this is a previously undescribed mRNA maturation by trans-splicing uncoupled from transcription. We identified an RNA-recognition motif-type protein, homologous to the mammalian polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, interacting with one of the partially processed RNAs analyzed here that might be involved in exon skipping. We propose that splice-site skipping might be part of a posttranscriptional mechanism to regulate gene expression in trypanosomes, through the generation of premature nontranslatable RNA molecules.",

The fractionation procedure separates two components that are both likely to be poly(A) polymerases. The candidate poly(A) polymerases were interchangeable and participated during both RNA cleavage and adenosine addition. They were discriminated from each other by chromatographic properties, heat sensitivity and divalent cation requirement. We have compared our data with published information and have been able to correlate the activities that we have isolated to previously identified polyadenylation factors. However, we have not been able to assign one of the candidate poly(A) polymerases to a previously identified poly(A) polymerase.

In this study, the role of polyadenylation modification of maternal transcripts in pig oocytes was investigated by adding cordycepin (3'-dA), a potent polyadenylation inhibitor, to the culture medium of porcine oocytes maturing in vitro. 3'-dA significantly prevented cumulus expansion regardless of the concentration used, and inhibited pig oocyte maturation in a dose-dependent manner. Further, 3'-dA 1 microg/ml-treated MII oocytes experienced significantly lower rates of cleavage (29%) and blastocyst formation (15.35%) compared to control MII oocytes (58.6% and 35.3%, respectively). Western blotting revealed that the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p34(cdc2) was significantly decreased in oocytes and cumulus cells treated with 3'-dA at a concentration of 1 microg/ml or greater. To further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, expression patterns and polyadenylation states of four important genes, C-mos, cyclin B, GDF9 and BMP15, were studied as representative maternal transcripts by real-time PCR and the PAT assay. 3'-dA at concentrations above 1 microg/ml significantly prevented polyadenylation and caused aberrant expression of C-mos and GDF9 during oocyte maturation. These results suggest that polyadenylation inhibitor blocked pig oocyte maturation in vitro by one or more of the following actions: (1) inactivation of MAPK and MPF in oocytes, especially at the late stages (MI and MII); (2) prevention of cumulus cell expansion through inactivation of cellular MAPK; and (3) inhibition of the maternal mRNA polyadenylation process, which in reverse, disrupted the maternal mRNA patterns in pig oocytes' maturation in vitro.",

The overlapping nucleotide, a guanosine residue, thus encodes both the discriminator base of the tRNA(Tyr) and the 5'base of the tRNA(Cys). When cDNA clones of circularized forms of the tRNA(Tyr) are analyzed, the discriminator nucleotide is an adenosine residue rather than the genomically encoded guanosine. Thus, the tRNA(Tyr) is subjected to an RNA editing activity similar to that shown to exist in the mitochondria of two other animal species. Interestingly, some cDNA clones have several adenosine residues at their 3'-ends instead of the expected CCA-sequence. Furthermore, a review of sequence data from animal mitochondrial genomes suggests that only tRNAs whose discriminator bases are adenosines tend to have genes that overlap with downstream genes. Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria.",

However, a compensatory mechanism involving the binding of the hnRNP H/F family of RNA binding proteins to an RNA G-quadruplex (G4) structure located in the vicinity of a polyadenylation site has previously been described to allow the transcript encoding the p53 tumour suppressor protein to be properly processed during DNA damage and to provide the cells with a way to react to DNA damage. Here we report that the DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box RNA helicase DHX36/RHAU/G4R1, which specifically binds to and resolves parallel-stranded G4, is necessary to maintain p53 pre-mRNA 3'-end processing following UV-induced DNA damage. DHX36 binds to the p53 RNA G4, while mutation of the G4 impairs the ability of DHX36 to maintain pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. Stabilization of the p53 RNA G4 with two different G4 ligands (<sup>PNA</sup>DOTASQ and PhenDC3), which is expected from previous studies to prevent DHX36 from binding and unwinding G4s, also impairs p53 pre-mRNA 3'-end processing following UV.

To further characterize the nucleotide residues at the 5' end of vRNA which might be involved in polyadenylation, a complete set of short and long model vRNA-like templates with mutations at nucleotides 1' to 13' (prime notation denotes numbering from the 5' end) of vRNA were synthesized and transcribed in vitro. The products were assayed for mRNA production with both reverse transcription-PCR and [alpha-32P]ATP incorporation assays. Results from these independent assays showed that vRNA templates with point mutations at positions 2', 3', 7' to 9', and 11' to 13' synthesized polyadenylated transcripts inefficiently compared with those with mutations at positions 1', 4' to 6', and 10'. Positions 2', 3', 7' to 9', and 11' are known to be involved in RNA polymerase binding. Furthermore, residues at positions 11' to 13' are known to be involved in base pairing between the 3' and 5' ends of vRNA. These findings demonstrate that the RNA polymerase has to bind to the 5' end of the template vRNA, which must then interact with the 3' end of the same template for polyadenylation to occur.

The macromolecular complex responsible for processing both canonical and histone pre-mRNAs contains the approximately 1160-residue protein Symplekin. Secondary-structural prediction algorithms identified putative HEAT domains in the 300 N-terminal residues of all Symplekins of known sequence. The structure and dynamics of this domain were investigated to begin elucidating the role Symplekin plays in mRNA maturation. The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing. Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA maturation process.",

Cleavage of simian virus 40 late pre-mRNA in a crude nuclear extract generated two RNAs, 5' and 3' half-molecules. These RNAs were unmodified and linear. The 5' half-molecule contained sequences upstream but not downstream of the poly(A) site and ended in a 3'-terminal hydroxyl. The 3' half-molecules comprised a family of RNAs, each of which contains only sequences downstream of the poly(A) site, and ends in a 5'-terminal phosphate. These RNAs differed only in the locations of their 5' terminus. The 3' terminus of the 5' half-molecule was the adenosine 10 nucleotides downstream of AAUAAA, at the +1 position. The 5' terminus of the longest 3' half-molecule was at +2. Thus, these two RNAs contain every nucleoside and phosphate of the precursor. The existence of these half-molecules demonstrates that endonucleolytic cleavage occurs near the poly(A) site. 5' half-molecules generated in the presence of EDTA (which blocks polyadenylation, but not cleavage) ended at the adenosine at position +1 of the precursor. When incubated in the extract under suitable conditions, they became polyadenylated. 5' half-molecules formed in 3'-dATP-containing reactions contained a single 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) residue added onto the +1 adenosine and were poor polyadenylation substrates.

Because cyanobacteria is a prokaryote believed to be related to the evolutionary ancestor of the chloroplast, we asked whether the molecular mechanism of RNA polyadenylation in the Synechocystis PCC6803 cyanobacteria is similar to that in E. coli or the chloroplast. We found that RNA polyadenylation in Synechocystis is similar to that in the chloroplast but different from E. coli. No poly(A) polymerase enzyme exists, and polyadenylation is performed by PNPase, resulting in heterogeneous poly(A)-rich tails. These heterogeneous tails were found in the amino acid coding region, the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, as well as in rRNA and the single intron located at the tRNA(fmet).

Recently, polyadenylation of nuclear-encoded transcripts in yeast was reported to promote RNA degradation, demonstrating that polyadenylation can play a double-edged role for RNA of nuclear origin. Here we asked whether in human cells ribosomal RNA can undergo polyadenylation. Using both molecular and bioinformatic approaches, we detected non-abundant polyadenylated transcripts of the 18S and 28S rRNAs. Interestingly, many of the post-transcriptionally added tails were composed of heteropolymeric poly(A)-rich sequences containing the other nucleotides in addition to adenosine. These polyadenylated RNA fragments are most likely degradation intermediates, as primer extension (PE) analysis revealed the presence of distal fragmented molecules, some of which matched the polyadenylation sites of the proximal cleavage products revealed by oligo(dT) and circled RT-PCR.

In this work, we analysed RNA polyadenylation and degradation in the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Haloferax volcanii. No RNA polyadenylation was detected in the halophilic archaeon H. volcanii. However, RNA polynucleotidylation occurred in hyperthermophiles of the genus Sulfolobus and was mediated by the archaea exosome complex. Together, our results identify the first organism without RNA polyadenylation and show a polyadenylation activity of the archaea exosome.",

Not only homopolymeric poly(A)-tails, comprised exclusively of adenosines, but also heteropolymeric poly(A)-rich extensions, which include the other three nucleotides as well, have been observed in bacteria, archaea, chloroplasts, and human cells. Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and the archaeal exosome, which bear strong similarities to one another, both functionally and structurally, were found to polymerize the heteropolymeric tails in bacteria, spinach chloroplasts, and archaea. As phosphorylases, these enzymes use diphosphate nucleotides as substrates and can reversibly polymerize or degrade RNA, depending on the relative concentrations of nucleotides and inorganic phosphate. A possible scenario, illustrating the evolution of RNA polyadenylation and its related functions, is presented, in which PNPase (or the archaeal exosome) was the first polyadenylating enzyme to evolve and the heteropolymeric tails that it produced, functioned in a polyadenylation-stimulated RNA degradation pathway. Only at a later stage in evolution, did the poly(A)-polymerases that use only ATP as a substrate, hence producing homopolymeric adenosine extensions, arise. Following the appearance of homopolymeric tails, a new role for polyadenylation evolved; RNA stability. This was accomplished by utilizing stable poly(A)-tails associated with the mature 3' ends of transcripts. Today, stable polyadenylation coexists with unstable heteropolymeric and homopolymeric tails. Therefore, the heteropolymeric poly(A)-rich tails, observed in bacteria, organelles, archaea, and human cells, represent an ancestral stage in the evolution of polyadenylation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9933592": "Polyadenylation contributes to the destabilization of bacterial mRNA. We have investigated the role of polyadenylation in the degradation of RNA by the purified Escherichia coli degradosome in vitro. RNA molecules with 3'-ends incorporated into a stable stem-loop structure could not readily be degraded by purified polynucleotide phosphorylase or by the degradosome, even though the degradosome contains active RhlB helicase which normally facilitates degradation of structured RNA. The exoribonucleolytic activity of the degradosome was due to polynucleotide phosphorylase, rather than the recently reported exonucleolytic activity exhibited by a purified fragment of RNase E (Huang, H., Liao, J., and Cohen, S. N. (1998) Nature 391, 99-102). Addition of a 3'-poly(A) tail stimulated degradation by the degradosome. As few as 5 adenosine residues were sufficient to achieve this stimulation, and generic sequences were equally effective. The data show that the degradosome requires a single-stranded \"toehold\" 3' to a secondary structure to recognize and degrade the RNA molecule efficiently; polyadenylation can provide this single-stranded 3'-end. Significantly, oligo(G) and oligo(U) tails were unable to stimulate degradation; for oligo(G), at least, this is probably due to the formation of a G quartet structure which makes the 3'-end inaccessible. The inaccessibility of 3'-oligo(U) sequences is likely to have a role in stabilization of RNA molecules generated by Rho-independent terminators."
