Increased blood levels of vascular endothelial growth factor are usually confirmatory. This rare disorder should not be missed, especially if the patient has a putative diagnosis of chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy, a lambda restricted monoclonal gammopathy, and thrombocytosis, and is not responding as expected to immunomodulatory therapy commonly used for chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy.",

Radiation therapy is effective for patients with a localized presentation, without bone marrow involvement, and 1 to 3 bone lesions. Patients with disseminated disease should receive, preferably, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood transplantation. Low-dose melphalan and dexamethasone or new agents used in myeloma are also effective. The most promising agent is lenalidomide, which could be given before high-dose therapy or radiation to get rapid neurologic responses.",

The presence of a lambda monoclonal protein, elevated vascular endothelial growth factor, systemic features, and treatment resistance are clues to the diagnosis. Castleman disease (CD) is seen in a subset of these patients, and when present the neuropathy is similar but less severe.

We retrospectively reviewed 299 patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome in a tertiary-care university hospital from 2000 until 2014. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was used to define renal impairment and response, according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria. We examined the impact of renal impairment and response on patient survival. Sixty-seven patients (22.4%) had renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) at baseline. In a multivariate analysis, ascites was independently associated with renal impairment [odds ratio (OR) 12.366, P &lt; 0.001]. Renal impairment was reversible in 66.0% of patients receiving therapy and was associated with a shorter time interval between symptom onset and treatment (OR 0.059, P = 0.043) and a vascular endothelial growth factor remission (OR 15.958, P = 0.050) in a multivariate analysis. In terms of therapy, patients with a renal response more commonly received a novel agent-based regimen (P = 0.037), which also led to a shorter response time (P = 0.001).

The polysymptomatic clinical picture, progressive course and no-concurrent manifestations of main features impede the diagnosis. In this case, the first symptoms were the sensomotor polyneuropathy, peripheral oedema, osteosclerotic bone lesions, skin changes, organomegaly. They preceded diagnosis by 3 years. The first endocrinopathy was hypothyroidism. Definite diagnosis was delayed because we couldn't detect the presence of M protein. Immunoelectrophoresis didn't detect it, but analysis by immunofixation detected M protein in serum and urine. Within 3 years of the first symptoms, she developed hypogonadism hypergonadotropic. At first, the monotherapy with corticosteroids was used, then--melfalan with prednisone. Due to the progression of the disease, a thalidomide was used in therapy (it is anti-VEGF agent). One of the side effects of the treatment of thalidomide is the progression of polyneuropathy, which was observed in this patient. After finishing this therapy she received chemotherapy.

Here we examine the stability of telomeres in quiescent cells using fission yeast. While wild type telomeres are stable in quiescence, we observe that eroded telomeres were highly rearranged during quiescence in telomerase minus cells. These rearrangements depend on homologous recombination (HR) and correspond to duplications of subtelomeric regions. HR is initiated at newly identified subtelomeric homologous repeated sequences (HRS). We further show that TERRA (Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA) is increased in post-mitotic cells with short telomeres and correlates with telomere rearrangements. Finally, we demonstrate that rearranged telomeres prevent cells to exit properly from quiescence. Taken together, we describe in fission yeast a mode of telomere repair mechanism specific to post-mitotic cells that is likely promoted by transcription.",

We have identified telomeric transcripts in fission yeast, a model system that combines precise genetic manipulability with telomeres remarkably similar to those of human. Like human and budding yeast, fission yeast harbours a population of telomeric RNA molecules containing G-rich telomeric repeats transcribed from the subtelomere to the telomere. In addition, we detect substantial levels of C-rich telomeric RNA whose appearance is independent of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, suggesting that the telomere repeats themselves serve as promoter sites; multiple distinct subtelomeric RNAs are also present. The regulation of these transcripts depends on the telomere-associated proteins Taz1 and Rap1, as deletion of taz1(+) or rap1(+) leads to increased levels of both telomere repeat-containing and subtelomeric transcripts. In contrast, loss of the heterochromatin proteins Swi6 or Clr4 or the telomerase regulator Rif1 results in elevated subtelomeric RNA levels while telomere-repeat containing transcript levels remain repressed. Coupled with the large body of knowledge surrounding the functions of telomeric and heterochromatin factors in fission yeast, these in vivo analyses suggest testable models for the roles of TERRA in telomere function.",

Experimental evidence accumulated during the past few years indicates that the transcriptional activity of telomeres is changed in cells in which the integrity of the telomeres or the heterochromatic state of chromosome ends is altered. On the contrary transcription of a telomere appears not to be influenced by its length. In this paper we briefly review the current state of knowledge on the composition, biogenesis, and regulation of the telomeric transcriptome from yeasts to humans. We also suggest a model in which TERRA is part of the DNA damage response triggered by dysfunctional telomeres and discuss the potential involvement of telomere transcription in the development of human pathologies.",

At telomeres that contain only X-elements, the Rap1 carboxy-terminal domain recruits the Sir2/3/4 and Rif1/2 complexes to repress transcription in addition to promoting Rat1-nuclease-dependent TERRA degradation. At telomeres that contain Y' elements, however, Rap1 represses TERRA through recruitment of Rif1 and Rif2.

The scope of their functions, physical organization, and disease relevance remain in the early stages of characterization. Although many thousands of lncRNA transcripts recently have been found to emanate from the expansive DNA between protein-coding genes in animals, there are also hundreds that have been found in simple eukaryotes. Furthermore, lncRNAs have been found in the bacterial and archaeal branches of the tree of life, suggesting they are ubiquitous. In this chapter, we focus primarily on what has been learned so far about lncRNAs from the greatly studied single-celled eukaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most lncRNAs examined in yeast have been implicated in transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes-often in response to forms of stress-whereas a select few have been ascribed yet other functions. Of those known to be involved in transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, the vast majority function in cis. There are also some yeast lncRNAs identified that are not directly involved in regulation of transcription. Examples of these include the telomerase RNA and telomere-encoded transcripts. In addition to its role as a template-encoding telomeric DNA synthesis, telomerase RNA has been shown to function as a flexible scaffold for protein subunits of the RNP holoenzyme. The flexible scaffold model provides a specific mechanistic paradigm that is likely to apply to many other lncRNAs that assemble and orchestrate large RNP complexes, even in humans. Looking to the future, it is clear that considerable fundamental knowledge remains to be obtained about the architecture and functions of lncRNAs. Using genetically tractable unicellular model organisms should facilitate lncRNA characterization. The acquired basic knowledge will ultimately translate to better understanding of the growing list of lncRNAs linked to human maladies.",

In recent years, single-cell microscopy techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization and live-cell imaging have been developed to image the RNA subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme. These techniques are now becoming important tools for the study of telomerase biogenesis, its association with telomeres and its regulation. Here, we present detailed protocols for live-cell imaging of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase RNA subunit, called TLC1, and also of the non-coding telomeric repeat-containing RNA TERRA. We describe the approach used for genomic integration of MS2 stem-loops in these transcripts, and provide information for optimal live-cell imaging of these non-coding RNAs.",

We show here that TERRA RNA interacts with several telomere-associated proteins, including telomere repeat factors 1 (TRF1) and 2 (TRF2), subunits of the origin recognition complex (ORC), heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), histone H3 trimethyl K9 (H3 K9me3), and members of the DNA-damage-sensing pathway. siRNA depletion of TERRA caused an increase in telomere dysfunction-induced foci, aberrations in metaphase telomeres, and a loss of histone H3 K9me3 and ORC at telomere repeat DNA. Previous studies found that TRF2 amino-terminal GAR domain recruited ORC to telomeres. We now show that TERRA RNA can interact directly with the TRF2 GAR and ORC1 to form a stable ternary complex. We conclude that TERRA facilitates TRF2 interaction with ORC and plays a central role in telomere structural maintenance and heterochromatin formation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22641694": "Telomeres play crucial roles in the maintenance of genome integrity and control of cellular senescence. Most eukaryotic telomeres can be transcribed to generate a telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) that persists as a heterogeneous nuclear RNA and can be developmentally regulated. However, the precise function and regulation of TERRA in normal and cancer cell development remains poorly understood. Here, we show that TERRA accumulates in highly proliferating normal and cancer cells, and forms large nuclear foci, which are distinct from previously characterized markers of DNA damage or replication stress. Using a mouse model for medulloblastoma driven by chronic Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, TERRA RNA was detected in tumor, but not adjacent normal cells using both RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and northern blotting. RNA FISH revealed the formation of TERRA foci (TERFs) in the nuclear regions of rapidly proliferating tumor cells. In the normal developing cerebellum, TERRA aggregates could also be detected in highly proliferating zones of progenitor neurons. SHH could enhance TERRA expression in purified granule progenitor cells in vitro, suggesting that proliferation signals contribute to TERRA expression in responsive tissue. TERRA foci did not colocalize with \u03b3H2AX foci, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or Cajal bodies in mouse tumor tissue. We also provide evidence that TERRA is elevated in a variety of human cancers. These findings suggest that elevated TERRA levels reflect a novel early form of telomere regulation during replication stress and cancer cell evolution, and the TERRA RNA aggregates may form a novel nuclear body in highly proliferating mammalian cells.",

The literature on contact lens discomfort that relates to signs of inflammation was searched. Reference was paid to the cardinal signs of inflammation (pain, heat, redness, and swelling) as well as the appearance of inflammatory mediators in the tear film during contact lens wear. Contact lens wear does induce discomfort, which is a mild form of pain, and wearing of lenses can induce increases in limbal and conjunctival redness. However, there is little evidence for a direct relationship between limbal or conjunctival redness and contact lens discomfort. Contact lenses may increase the temperature of the ocular surface by a small amount (\u22642.1\u00b0C). Corneal or conjunctival swelling has not been associated with contact lens discomfort. Complement or kinin breakdown products or histamine in tears are not associated with contact lens discomfort. Cytokines are generally not related to discomfort, although nerve growth factor levels were increased in tears of symptomatics in one report. The presence of degraded lipids, leukotriene B4 and peroxidation products, and the enzyme secretory phospholipase A2 in tears has been associated with contact lens discomfort, and this area is worthy of further research.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23931059": "Inflammation is a protective response essential for maintaining human health and for fighting disease. As an active innate immune reaction to challenge, inflammation gives rise to clinical cardinal signs: rubor, calor, dolor, tumor and functio laesa. Termination of acute inflammation was previously recognized as a passive process; a natural decay of pro-inflammatory signals. We now understand that the natural resolution of inflammation involves well-integrated, active, biochemical programs that return tissues to homeostasis. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the role of endogenous lipid mediators that modulate cellular fate and inflammation. Biosynthesis of eicosanoids and other lipids in exudates coincides with changes in the types of inflammatory cells. Resolution of inflammation is initiated by an active class switch in lipid mediators, such as classic prostaglandins and leukotrienes, to the production of proresolution mediators. Endogenous pro-resolving lipid mediators, including arachidonic acid-derived lipoxins, aspirin-triggered lipoxins, \u03c93-eicosapentaenoic acid-derived resolvins of the E-series, docosahexaenoic acid-derived resolvins of the D-series, protectins and maresins, are biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation. Depending on the type of injury and the type of tissue, the initial cells that respond are polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes/macrophages, epithelial cells or endothelial cells. The selective interaction of specific lipid mediators with G protein-coupled receptors expressed on innate immune cells (e.g. G protein-coupled receptor 32, lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor2, chemokine-like receptor 1, leukotriene B4 receptor type 1 and cabannoid receptor 2) induces cessation of leukocyte infiltration; vascular permeability/edema returns to normal with polymorphonuclear neutrophil death (mostly via apoptosis), the nonphlogistic infiltration of monocyte/macrophages and the removal (by macrophages) of apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils, foreign agents (bacteria) and necrotic debris from the site. While an acute inflammatory response that is resolved in a timely manner prevents tissue injury, inadequate resolution and failure to return tissue to homeostasis results in neutrophil-mediated destruction and chronic inflammation. A better understanding of the complex mechanisms of lipid agonist mediators, cell targets and actions allows us to exploit and develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat human inflammatory diseases, including periodontal diseases.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23583354": "Inflammation is a beneficial host reaction to tissue damage and has the essential primary purpose of restoring tissue homeostasis. Inflammation plays a major role in containing and resolving infection and may also occur under sterile conditions. The cardinal signs of inflammation dolor, calor, tumor and rubor are intrinsically associated with events including vasodilatation, edema and leukocyte trafficking into the site of inflammation. If uncontrolled or unresolved, inflammation itself can lead to further tissue damage and give rise to chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity with eventual loss of organ function. It is now evident that the resolution of inflammation is an active continuous process that occurs during an acute inflammatory episode. Successful resolution requires activation of endogenous programs with switch from production of pro-inflammatory towards pro-resolving molecules, such as specific lipid mediators and annexin A1, and the non-phlogistic elimination of granulocytes by apoptosis with subsequent removal by surrounding macrophages. These processes ensure rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of resolution of inflammation, highlighting the pharmacological strategies that may interfere with the molecular pathways which control leukocyte survival and clearance. Such strategies have proved beneficial in several pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of the resolution process may be useful for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases in humans.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12776909": "The concept of the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation comes from antiquity as rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore, (redness and swelling with heat and pain) extended later by functio laesa (loss of function). The contemporary understanding of this process we owe to 19th-century milestone discoveries by Rudolph Virchow, Julius Cohnheim and Elie Metchnikoff. In the 20th century, the development of potent technological tools allowed the rapid expansion of knowledge of the cells and mediators of inflammatory processes, as well as the molecular mechanisms of their interactions. It turned out that some mediators of inflammation have both local and distant targets, among them the liver (responding by the production of several acute phase reactants) and neurohormonal centers. In the last decades it has become clear that the immune system shares mediators and their receptors with the neurohormonal system of the body; thus, they form a common homeostatic entity. Such an integrative view, introduced by J. Edwin Blalock, when combined with Hans Selye's concept of stress, led to the contemporary understanding of sickness behavior, defined by Robert Dantzer as a highly organized strategy of the organism to fight infections and to respond to other environmental stressors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10867774": "I mmunological responses are considered to be either humoral, resulting from cloning of B lymphocytes, or cell mediated, resulting from cloning of T lymphocytes. Autoimmune diseases occur when the cloned products attack host tissue. Inflammation is considered a nonspecific response to injury, characterized by exudation of serum into damaged tissue, and identified by the cardinal signs of rubor, calor, dolor, and tumor. However, these classic mechanisms do not fit pathological observations of Alzheimer disease (AD)-affected brain tissue. Although many of the components prominently associated with peripheral immunological and inflammatory states are present in AD lesions, there are no identifiable B lymphocytes or antibodies, and T cells are sparse. Furthermore, the blood-brain barrier is intact, excluding exudation of exogenous serum proteins. Although \"neuroinflammation\" is the term commonly used to describe the pathological changes, it fails to define adequately the process that is taking place. The reaction is neither a nonspecific response to injury, as classically implied for inflammatory reactions, nor an autoimmune reaction, despite the directed attack against plaques and extracellular tangles. It is most appropriately defined as an innate immunoreaction. The fact that such a reaction can be mounted by brain, an organ frequently described as being immunologically privileged, suggests that a reevaluation is required of the dimensions of the innate immune system, including how it operates at the tissue level. The innate immune system is primitive, while the adaptive immune system, which is directed by peripheral immune organs, is an invention of vertebrates. Even in vertebrates, however, the innate immune system is the first line of defense. Much more needs to be learned about the operation of the innate immune system in health and disease.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12799851": "According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context. When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms. In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body. Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed. Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception. It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor). He also coined the term [see text] to characterize an attack of migraine. In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology. On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets. In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus.",

This is based mainly on his wide clinical experience, including that as a military surgeon. He, however, supplements this with a number of experiments, some of which are classic. He bases his observations on the four cardinal signs of Celsus (redness, heat, swelling and pain). Inflammation is then divided into three main groups: adhesive, suppurative and ulcerative. He discusses the nature of pus and the formation and treatment of abscesses. He describes his experiments on the transplantation of tissues under the general heading of adhesive inflammation. This, he states, underlies the union of wounds and thus the union of tissues after transplantation. Although unaware of the role of infecting organisms as a cause of inflammation, he makes observations on inflammation in smallpox, venereal infections and tuberculosis. He relates these to his observations on inflammatory aspects of wound healing. Lister was particularly influenced by Hunter's observations in the development of antisepsis.

Two additional faster growing Mycobacterium strains [Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 23246) and Mycobacterium aurum (NCTC 10437)] were included in the assay as predictive test organisms for the more pathogenic strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Some plant species, such as Alchornea floribunda, Musanga cecropioides (both leaves and stem bark), Tetracera potatoria and Xylopia aethiopica (stem bark), were effective in inhibiting Morexella cattarhalis, having MIC values between 65 and 250 \u03bcg/mL.

In the BMPR1A-related polyps, five out of nine (56%) displayed LOH. Further analysis of selected polyps revealed that LOH was gene copy number neutral and had occurred in the epithelial compartment. The heterogeneity of genetic mutations and protein expression levels indicates that different modes of gene inactivation can be operational in SMAD4- and BMPR1A-related polyp formation. Our observation, that about half of BMPR1A-related polyps displayed LOH, predominantly in the epithelial compartment, is compatible with BMPR1A acting as a tumour suppressor gene.

Individuals with JPS due to mutations in SMAD4 are at greater risk to manifest signs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is caused by either mutations in SMAD4 or other genes that modulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling. Additional genes in the TGF\u03b2 network include FBN1, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2, mutations of which cause either Marfan syndrome (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), respectively. As SMAD4, FBN1, and TGFBR1/2 map to different regions of the genome, disorders associated with mutations in these genes are not expected to co-segregate in a family. We report an individual whose family history was positive for aortopathy, mitral valve dysfunction, and JPS. Mutation analysis of SMAD4 implicates this gene for these phenotypes in this family. Although SMAD4 is among several genes in the TGF\u03b2 network, and although prior single case reports have described large vessel aneurysms in HHT, this is the first description of aortic and mitral disease presenting with JPS. This observation suggests that, in addition to HHT, individuals with SMAD4 mutations may be at risk for aortic dilation and mitral valve dysfunction. We emphasize the importance of comprehensive review of the medical history prior to molecular testing, especially in an asymptomatic patient.",

BMPR1A and SMAD4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. We identified a BMPR1A mutation, which involves a duplication of coding exon 3 (c.230+452_333+441dup1995), on multiple ligation dependent probe amplification in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome. The mutation causes a frameshift, producing a truncated protein (p.D112NfsX2). Therefore, the mutation is believed to be pathogenic. We also identified a duplication breakpoint in which Alu sequences are located. These results suggest that the duplication event resulted from recombination between Alu sequences. To our knowledge, partial duplication in the BMPR1A gene has not been reported previously. This is the first case report to document coding exon 3 duplication in the BMPR1A gene in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome.",

The cumulative life-time risk of colorectal cancer is 39% and the relative risk is 34. Juvenile polyps have a distinctive histology characterized by an abundance of edematous lamina propria with inflammatory cells and cystically dilated glands lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium with reactive changes. Clinically, juvenile polyposis syndrome is defined by the presence of 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colorectum, juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract or any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history of juvenile polyposis. In about 50%-60% of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene is found. Both genes play a role in the BMP/TGF-beta signalling pathway. It has been suggested that cancer in juvenile polyposis may develop through the so-called \"landscaper mechanism\" where an abnormal stromal environment leads to neoplastic transformation of the adjacent epithelium and in the end invasive carcinoma. Recognition of this rare disorder is important for patients and their families with regard to treatment, follow-up and screening of at risk individuals. Each clinician confronted with the diagnosis of a juvenile polyp should therefore consider the possibility of juvenile polyposis syndrome. In addition, juvenile polyposis syndrome provides a unique model to study colorectal cancer pathogenesis in general and gives insight in the molecular genetic basis of cancer. This review discusses clinical manifestations, genetics, pathogenesis and management of juvenile polyposis syndrome.",

Mutation and phenotype analysis was used in 80 unrelated patients of whom 65 met the clinical criteria for JPS (typical JPS) and 15 were suspected to have JPS. By direct sequencing of the two genes, point mutations were identified in 30 patients (46% of typical JPS). Using MLPA, large genomic deletions were found in 14% of all patients with typical JPS (six deletions in SMAD4 and three deletions in BMPR1A). Mutation analysis of the PTEN gene in the remaining 41 mutation negative cases uncovered a point mutation in two patients (5%). SMAD4 mutation carriers had a significantly higher frequency of gastric polyposis (73%) than did patients with BMPR1A mutations (8%) (p&lt;0.001); all seven cases of gastric cancer occurred in families with SMAD4 mutations. SMAD4 mutation carriers with gastric polyps were significantly older at gastroscopy than those without (p&lt;0.001). In 22% of the 23 unrelated SMAD4 mutation carriers, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was also diagnosed clinically. The documented histologic findings encompassed a wide distribution of different polyp types, comparable with that described in hereditary mixed polyposis syndromes (HMPS). Screening for large deletions raised the mutation detection rate to 60% in the 65 patients with typical JPS. A strong genotype-phenotype correlation for gastric polyposis, gastric cancer, and HHT was identified, which should have implications for counselling and surveillance.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a dominant disorder characterized by epistaxis, visceral arteriovenous malformations, and telangiectasias. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is diagnosed when \u2265 3 criteria including clinical manifestations or a family history, are present. A juvenile polyposis-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia overlap syndrome has previously been reported in 22% of patients with juvenile polyposis due to a SMAD4 mutation. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia by Curacao criteria in our juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients. This was a cohort study of juvenile polyposis patients in our inherited colon cancer registries. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia manifestations were obtained from medical records, patient contact, and/or prospective hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening. The Curacao criteria was used for diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (\u2265 3 criteria diagnostic; 2 criteria suspect of). Prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients. Forty-one juvenile polyposis families were identified. Genetic testing was available for individuals within 18 families. SMAD4 mutations were found in 21 relatives in 9 families. Eighty-one percent of SMAD4 patients had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and 14% were suspected of having hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Epistaxis and asthma are the most common symptoms in our overlap patients. Symptomatic and subclinical arteriovenous malformations were noted near universally. There was a single, tertiary referral center. Nearly all juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients have the overlap syndrome. The clinical implications and need for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening are important factors for genetic testing in juvenile polyposis.

Mapping studies for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin markers have become widely used tools for identifying gene regulatory elements, but prediction of target genes remains a major challenge. Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict &gt;90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes 150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can influence gene expression.",

Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations in <i>COL1A1</i> or <i>COL1A2</i> and show autosomal dominant inheritance, during the last years there has been an explosion in the number of genes responsible for both recessive and dominant forms of this condition. Herein, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with OI, all offspring of unaffected parents, to determine the spectrum of variants accounting for these cases. Twenty patients had nonrelated parents and were sporadic, and 21 were born to consanguineous relationships. Mutation analysis was performed using a next-generation sequencing gene panel, homozygosity mapping, and whole exome sequencing (WES). Patients offspring of nonconsanguineous parents were mostly identified with <i>COL1A1</i> or <i>COL1A2</i> heterozygous changes, although there were also a few cases with <i>IFITM5</i> and <i>WNT1</i> heterozygous mutations. Only one sporadic patient was a compound heterozygote for two recessive mutations. Patients offspring of consanguineous parents showed homozygous changes in a variety of genes including <i>CRTAP</i>,<i>FKBP10</i>,<i>LEPRE1</i>,<i>PLOD2</i>,<i>PPIB</i>,<i>SERPINF1</i>,<i>TMEM38B</i>, and <i>WNT1</i>. In addition, two patients born to consanguineous parents were found to have de novo <i>COL1A1</i> heterozygous mutations demonstrating that causative variants in the collagen I structural genes cannot be overlooked in affected children from consanguineous couples. Further to this, WES analysis in probands lacking mutations in OI genes revealed deleterious variants in <i>SCN9A</i>,<i>NTRK1</i>, and <i>SLC2A2</i>, which are associated with congenital indifference to pain (CIP) and Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS). This work provides useful information for clinical and genetic diagnosis of OI patients with no positive family history of this disease.

However, within the last two decades, there have been growing number of variants identified in genes that follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Our proband is a child born in Mexico with multiple fractures of ribs, minimal calvarial mineralisation, platyspondyly, marked compression and deformed long bones. He also presented with significant hydranencephaly, requiring ventilatory support from birth, and died at 8days of age. A homozygous c.338_357delins22 variant in exon 2 of SERPINH1 was identified. This gene encodes heat shock protein 47, a collagen-specific chaperone which binds to the procollagen triple helix and is responsible for collagen stabilisation in the endoplasmic reticulum. There is minimal literature on the mechanism of action for variants in SERPINH1 resulting in osteogenesis imperfecta.

It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The pro\u03b11(I) and pro\u03b12(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Six other genes, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PP1B, SP7/Osterix (OSX), and SERPINH1, are associated with autosomal recessive forms of OI. However, other, rare phenotypes have also been described. There are many differential diagnoses of the short, syndromic child, including chromosomal, single gene, and multifactorial causes. However, one condition of particular relevance in the context of this report is the Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS). As originally described, the RSS is a very specific condition. However, it has subsequently become an umbrella term for a heterogeneous group of conditions presenting with short stature and triangular shape to the face. A significant proportion of these are now believed to be due to imprinting defects at 11p15. However, the cause in many cases remains unknown. We describe two cases with a phenotypic overlap between OI and RSS who both have COL1A1 mutations.

Recently, dysregulation of hydroxylation of a single proline residue at position 986 of both the triple-helical domains of type I collagen alpha1(I) and type II collagen alpha1(II) chains has been implicated in the pathogenesis of recessive forms of OI. Two proteins, cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl-3-hydroxylase-1 (P3H1, encoded by the LEPRE1 gene) form a complex that performs the hydroxylation and brings the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin-B (CYPB) to the unfolded collagen. In our screen of 78 subjects diagnosed with OI type II or III, we identified three probands with mutations in CRTAP and 16 with mutations in LEPRE1. The latter group includes a mutation in patients from the Irish Traveller population, a genetically isolated community with increased incidence of OI. The clinical features resulting from CRTAP or LEPRE1 loss of function mutations were difficult to distinguish at birth. Infants in both groups had multiple fractures, decreased bone modeling (affecting especially the femurs), and extremely low bone mineral density. Interestingly, \"popcorn\" epiphyses may reflect underlying cartilaginous and bone dysplasia in this form of OI. These results expand the range of CRTAP/LEPRE1 mutations that result in recessive OI and emphasize the importance of distinguishing recurrence of severe OI of recessive inheritance from those that result from parental germline mosaicism for COL1A1 or COL1A2 mutations.",

To date, less than 20 individuals with OI have been identified with BMP1 mutations, with skeletal phenotypes ranging from mild to severe and progressively deforming. In the majority of patients, bone fragility was associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD); however, the full range of phenotypes associated with BMP1 remains unclear.

The homozygous siblings with OI had normal areal BMD by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry whereas the third patient presented with a high bone mass phenotype. Intravenous bisphosphonate therapy was started in all patients, but discontinued in two patients and reduced in another due to concerns about increasing bone stiffness leading to chalk-stick fractures.

However, questions remain as to the selection of patients for treatment, effectiveness in fracture prevention, which bisphosphonates should be used and the duration of treatment. Orthopedic intervention occurs on several levels: including the immediate treatment of fractures, the treatment of scoliosis and the use of intramedullary rods. The discovery of mutations involving CRTAP and LEPRE1 genes in severe/lethal and recessively inherited osteogenesis imperfecta has provided partial answers to questions about 'other' osteogenesis imperfecta genes in patients with an osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype but no COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations. Current experience suggests that DNA analysis is a better test for diagnosis as compared with dermal biopsy. There are no standardized guidelines for initiating bisphosphonate treatment in children.

Eligible patients are 18-85 years old with hATTR amyloidosis, investigator-estimated survival of \u22652 years, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5-130, and polyneuropathy disability score \u2264IIIb. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either intravenous patisiran 0.3 mg/kg or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of patisiran at 18 months based on the difference in the change in modified NIS+7 (a composite measure of motor strength, sensation, reflexes, nerve conduction, and autonomic function) between the patisiran and placebo groups. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of patisiran on Norfolk-Diabetic Neuropathy quality of life questionnaire score, nutritional status (as evaluated by modified body mass index), motor function (as measured by NIS-weakness and timed 10-m walk test), and autonomic symptoms (as measured by the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 questionnaire).

In this study, we set out to determine whether 5-AzaCdR treatment can reprogram the epigenomic organization of the IGF2-H19 locus in a choriocarcinoma cancer cell line (JEG3). We found that localized DNA demethylation at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) induced by 5-AzaCdR, reduced IGF2, increased H19 expression, increased CTCF and cohesin recruitment and changed histone modifications. Furthermore chromatin accessibility was increased locus-wide and chromatin looping topography was altered such that a CTCF site downstream of the H19 enhancers switched its association with the CTCF site upstream of the IGF2 promoters to associate with the ICR. We identified a stable chromatin looping domain, which forms independently of DNA methylation. This domain contains the IGF2 gene and is marked by a histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation block between CTCF site upstream of the IGF2 promoters and the Centrally Conserved Domain upstream of the ICR.

These individuals had marked macrosomia and high incidence of Wilms' tumor. A subset of these patients had 1.4- to 1.8-kb deletions with hypermethylation of the remaining IC1 region and fully penetrant BWS phenotype when transmitted maternally. Another subset of individuals with IC1 hypermethylation had a similar clinical phenotype but no mutation in the local vicinity. All these cases were sporadic and in at least two families affected and unaffected members shared the same maternal IC1 allele but not the abnormal maternal epigenotype. Similarly, no IC1 deletion was detected in 10 nonsyndromic Wilms' tumors with IC1 hypermethylation.

In the OAT group, 16 of 22 patients presented a severe loss of methylation of the 6th CTCF, closely correlated with sperm concentration. The methylation state of DMR0 and of the 3rd CTCF was never affected by the pathological status of sperm samples. This study demonstrates that epigenetic perturbations of the 6th CTCF site of the H19 DMR might be a relevant biomarker for quantitative defects of spermatogenesis in humans. Moreover, we defined a methylation threshold sustaining the classification of patients in two groups, unmethylated and methylated. Using this new classification of patients, the observed intrinsic imprinting defects of spermatozoa appear not to impair significantly the outcome of assisted reproductive technologies.",

DNA methylation of the ICR controls the reciprocal imprinting of IGF2 and H19 by preventing the binding of the insulator protein, CTCF. We here show that local changes in histone modifications and CTCF--cohesin binding at the ICR in BWS and SRS together with DNA methylation correlate with the higher order chromatin structure at the locus. In lymphoblastoid cells from control individuals, we found the repressive histone H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 marks associated with the methylated paternal ICR allele and the bivalent H3K4me2/H3K27me3 mark together with H3K9ac and CTCF--cohesin associated with the non-methylated maternal allele. In patient-derived cell lines, the mat/pat asymmetric distribution of these epigenetic marks was lost with H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 becoming biallelic in the BWS and H3K4me2, H3K27me3 and H3K9ac together with CTCF-cohesin becoming biallelic in the SRS. We further show that in BWS and SRS cells, there is opposing chromatin looping conformation mediated by CTCF--cohesin binding sites surrounding the locus. In normal cells, lack of CTCF--cohesin binding at the paternal ICR is associated with monoallelic interaction between two CTCF sites flanking the locus. CTCF--cohesin binding at the maternal ICR blocks this interaction by associating with the CTCF site downstream of the enhancers. The two alternative chromatin conformations are differently favoured in BWS and SRS likely predisposing the locus to the activation of IGF2 or H19, respectively.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16378710": "Imprinting is an epigenetic modification that is reprogrammed in the germ line and leads to the monoallelic expression of some genes. Imprinting involves DNA methylation. Maternal imprint is reset during oocyte growth and maturation. In vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes may, therefore, interfere with imprint acquisition and/or maintenance. To evaluate if maturing human oocytes in vitro would be hazardous at the epigenetic level, we first determined the methylation profile of the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR). The methylation status of the H19 DMR seems particularly vulnerable to in vitro culture conditions. We analyzed oocytes at different stages of maturation following IVM, germinal vesicle (GV), metaphase I (MI), and metaphase II (MII), using the bisulfite mutagenesis technique. Our results indicated that the unmethylated specific maternal profile for the H19 DMR was stably established at the GV stage. The majority of MI-arrested oocytes exhibited an altered pattern of methylation, the CTCF-binding site being methylated in half of the DNA strands analyzed. Of the 20 MII oocytes analyzed, 15 showed the normal unmethylated maternal pattern, while 5 originating from two different patients exhibited a methylated pattern. These findings highlight the need for extended analysis on MII-rescued oocytes to appreciate the epigenetic safety of the IVM procedure, before it becomes a routine and practical assisted reproductive procedure.",

This region, extending from -2.0 kb upstream to the start of transcription, is heavily methylated in sperm and on the paternal allele in somatic cells. This methylation was preserved during pre-implantation. Structural analysis revealed the presence of CpG islands and a large direct repeat with a 400 bp sequence reiterated several times, but no significant sequence homology to the corresponding region of the mouse H19 gene. These findings could suggest a role for secondary DNA structure in genomic imprinting across the species, and they also present a puzzling aspect of the evolution of the H19 regulatory region in human and mouse.",

In contrast, epigenetic marks of active and inactive genes somehow survive mitosis, since the activity status from one cell generation to the next is maintained. For the zinc-finger protein CTCF, a role in interpreting and propagating epigenetic states and in separating expression domains has been documented. To test whether such a domain structure is preserved during mitosis, we examined whether CTCF is bound to mitotic chromatin. Here we show that in contrast to other zinc-finger proteins, CTCF indeed is bound to mitotic chromosomes. Mitotic binding is mediated by a portion of the zinc-finger DNA binding domain and involves sequence specific binding to target sites. Furthermore, the chromatin loop organized by the CTCF-bound, differentially methylated region at the Igf2/H19 locus can be detected in mitosis. In contrast, the enhancer/promoter loop of the same locus is lost in mitosis. This may provide a novel form of epigenetic memory during cell division.",

The expression of H19 and its closely associated IGF2 gene is frequently deregulated in some human tumors, such as Wilms' tumors. In these cases, biallelic IGF2 expression and lack of expression of H19 are associated with hypermethylation of the imprinting center of this locus. These observations and others have suggested a potential tumor suppressor effect of the H19 locus. Some studies have also suggested that H19 is an oncogene, based on tissue culture systems. We show, using in vivo murine models of tumorigenesis, that the H19 locus controls the size of experimental teratocarcinomas, the number of polyps in the Apc murine model of colorectal cancer and the timing of appearance of SV40-induced hepatocarcinomas. The H19 locus thus clearly displays a tumor suppressor effect in mice.",

Because a randomly integrated H19 ICR fragment, when incorporated into the genome of transgenic mice (TgM), was allele-specifically methylated in somatic, but not in germ cells, it was suggested that allele-discriminating epigenetic signature, set within or somewhere outside of the Tg H19 ICR fragment in germ cells, was later translated into a differential DNA methylation pattern. To test if the chicken \u03b2-globin HS4 (cHS4) chromatin insulator might interfere with methylation imprinting establishment at the H19 ICR, we inserted the H19 ICR fragment, flanked by a set of floxed cHS4 core sequences, into a human \u03b2-globin locus YAC and generated TgM (insulated ICR' TgM). As controls, the cHS4 sequences were removed from one side (5'HS4-deleted ICR') or both sides (pseudo-WT ICR') of the insulated ICR' by in vivo cre-loxP recombination. The data show that while maternally inherited transgenic H19 ICR was not methylated in insulated ICR' TgM, it was significantly methylated upon paternal transmission, though the level was lower than in the pseudo-WT ICR' control. Because this reduced level of methylation was also observed in the 5'HS4-deleted ICR' TgM, we speculate that the phenotype is due to VEZF1-dependent demethylation activity, rather than the insulator function, borne in cHS4. Collectively, although we cannot rule out the possibility that cHS4 is incapable of blocking an allele-discriminating signal from outside of the transgene, the epigenetic signature appears to be marked intrinsically within the H19 ICR.",

Previously, however, we observed that the paternal H19 ICR, when analyzed in yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice (YAC-TgM), was preferentially methylated only after fertilization. To identify the DNA sequences that confer methylation imprinting, we divided the H19 ICR into two fragments (1.7 and 1.2 kb), ligated them to both ends of a \u03bb DNA fragment into which CTCF binding sites had been inserted, and analyzed this in YAC-TgM. The maternally inherited \u03bb sequence, normally methylated after implantation in the absence of H19 ICR sequences, became hypomethylated, demonstrating protective activity against methylation within the ICR. Meanwhile, the paternally inherited \u03bb sequence was hypermethylated before implantation only when a 1.7-kb fragment was ligated. Consistently, when two subfragments of the H19 ICR were individually investigated for their activities in YAC-TgM, only the 1.7-kb fragment was capable of introducing paternal allele-specific DNA methylation. These results show that postfertilization methylation imprinting is conferred by a paternal allele-specific methylation activity present in a 1.7-kb DNA fragment of the H19 ICR, while maternal allele-specific activities protect the allele from de novo DNA methylation.",

We previously demonstrated that when placed in a heterologous genomic context, the H19 ICR fragment contains an intrinsic activity that allows it to acquire differential methylation in somatic cells but not in germ cells. In the present study, we investigated the requirements for the CTCF-binding sites of the ICR in the acquisition of post-fertilization methylation. To this end, two mutant ICR fragments were introduced into the human beta-globin locus in a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse (TgM) model: 4xMut had mutations in all four ICR CTCF-binding sites that prevented CTCF binding but retained the methylation target CpG motifs, and -9CG harbored mutations in the CpG motifs within the CTCF-binding sites but each site retained constitutive CTCF-binding activity. In TgM germ cells and pre-implantation blastocysts, the absence of CTCF-binding sites (4xMut) did not lead to hypermethylation of the transgenic H19 ICR. However, after implantation, the mutations of CTCF sites (4xMut and -9CG) affected the maintenance of methylation. These results demonstrated that although the CTCF-binding sites are indispensable for maintenance of the unmethylated state of the maternal ICR in post-implantation embryos, they are not required to establish paternal-allele-specific methylation of the transgenic H19 ICR in pre-implantation embryos.",

By grafting a 2.9-kbp H19 ICR fragment into a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome in transgenic mice, we previously showed that the ICR could recapitulate imprinted methylation and expression at a heterologous locus, suggesting that the H19 ICR in the beta-globin locus contained sufficient information to maintain the methylation mark (K. Tanimoto, M. Shimotsuma, H. Matsuzaki, A. Omori, J. Bungert, J. D. Engel, and A. Fukamizu, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:10250-10255, 2005). Curiously, however, the transgenic H19 ICR was not methylated in sperm, which was distinct from that seen in the endogenous locus. Here, we reevaluated the ability of the H19 ICR to mark the parental origin using more rigid criteria. In the testis, the methylation levels of the solitary 2.9-kbp transgenic ICR fragment varied significantly between six transgenic mouse lines. However, in somatic cells, the paternally inherited ICR fragment exhibited consistently higher methylation levels at five out of six randomly integrated sites in the mouse genome. These results clearly demonstrated that the H19 ICR could acquire parent-of-origin-dependent methylation after fertilization independently of the chromosomal integration site or the prerequisite methylation acquisition in male germ cells.",

This mechanism of gene regulation, where one element controls allelic expression of multiple genes, is not fully understood. Furthermore, the mechanism of gene dysregulation through ICR epimutations, such as loss or gain of DNA methylation, remains a mystery. We have used genetic mouse models to dissect ICR-mediated genetic and epigenetic regulation of imprinted gene expression. The H19/insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) ICR has a multifunctional role including insulation, activation and repression. Microdeletions at the human H19/IGF2 ICR (IC1) are proposed to be responsible for IC1 epimutations associated with imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Here, we have generated and characterized a mouse model that mimics BWS microdeletions to define the role of the deleted sequence in establishing and maintaining epigenetic marks and imprinted expression at the H19/IGF2 locus. These mice carry a 1.3 kb deletion at the H19/Igf2 ICR [\u03942,3] removing two of four CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites and the intervening sequence, \u223c75% of the ICR. Surprisingly, the \u03942,3 deletion does not perturb DNA methylation at the ICR; however, it does disrupt imprinted expression. While repressive functions of the ICR are compromised by the deletion regardless of tissue type, insulator function is only disrupted in tissues of mesodermal origin where a significant amount of CTCF is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. These findings suggest that insulator activity of the H19/Igf2 ICR varies by cell type and may depend on cell-specific enhancers as well as posttranslational modifications of the insulator protein CTCF.",

Like most imprinted genes, H19 and Igf2 are regulated by a differentially methylated imprinting control region (ICR). CTCF binding sites and DNA methylation at the ICR have previously been identified as key cis-acting elements required for proper H19/Igf2 imprinting. Here, we use mouse models to elucidate further the mechanism of ICR-mediated gene regulation. We specifically address the question of whether sequences outside of CTCF sites at the ICR are required for paternal H19 repression. To this end, we generated two types of mutant ICRs in the mouse: (i) deletion of intervening sequence between CTCF sites (H19(ICR\u2206IVS)), which changes size and CpG content at the ICR; and (ii) CpG depletion outside of CTCF sites (H19(ICR-8nrCG)), which only changes CpG content at the ICR. Individually, both mutant alleles (H19(ICR\u2206IVS) and H19(ICR-8nrCG)) show loss of imprinted repression of paternal H19. Interestingly, this loss of repression does not coincide with a detectable change in methylation at the H19 ICR or promoter. Thus, neither intact CTCF sites nor hypermethylation at the ICR is sufficient for maintaining the fully repressed state of the paternal H19 allele. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time in vivo, that sequence outside of CTCF sites at the ICR is required in cis for ICR-mediated imprinted repression at the H19/Igf2 locus. In addition, these results strongly implicate a novel role of ICR size and CpG density in paternal H19 repression.",

This region possesses an insulator function which is activated on the unmethylated maternal allele through the binding of the CTCF factor. It has been previously reported that paternal transmission of the H19(SilK) deletion, which removes the 3' portion of H19 ICR, leads to the loss of H19 imprinting. Here we show that, in the liver, this reactivation of the paternal H19 gene is concomitant to a dramatic decrease in Igf2 mRNA levels. This deletion alters higher-order chromatin architecture, Igf2 promoter usage and tissue-specific expression. Therefore, when methylated, the 3' portion of the H19 ICR is a bi-functional regulatory element involved not only in H19 imprinting but also in 'formatting' the higher-order chromatin structure for proper tissue-specific expression of both H19 and Igf2 genes.",

The mouse H19 gene, for example, is active only when maternally inherited and the neighboring Igf2 gene is paternally expressed. This imprinted expression pattern is regulated by the imprinting control region (ICR) upstream of the H19 gene. A maternally inherited H19 ICR inhibits Igf2 gene activation by the downstream enhancer due to its insulator function while it suppresses H19 gene transcription by promoter DNA methylation when paternally inherited. These parent-of-origin specific functions depend on the allele-specific methylation of the ICR DNA, which is established during gametogenesis. Therefore, the ICR may also function as a landmark for epigenetic modifications. To examine whether the ICR confers these activities autonomously, we introduced a 2.9-kbp ICR-containing DNA fragment into a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome at the 3' end of the locus control region and established transgenic mouse lines. Expression of all of the beta-like globin genes was higher when the transgene was paternally inherited. In accord with this result, transgenic ICR DNA from nucleated erythrocytes was more heavily methylated when paternally transmitted. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that CCCTC binding factor is preferentially recruited to the maternal transgenic ICR in vivo. Surprisingly however, the parent-of-origin specific methylation pattern was not observed in germ cell DNA in testis, demonstrating that methylation was established after fertilization. Thus, the ICR autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta-globin gene locus, but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous Igf2/H19 locus.",

The ICR has been shown to interact physically with a silencer region in Igf2, differentially methylated region (DMR)1, but the role of CTCF in this chromatin loop and whether it restricts the physical access of distal enhancers to Igf2 is not known. We performed systematic chromosome conformation capture analyses in the Igf2/H19 region over &gt;160 kb, identifying sequences that interact physically with the distal enhancers and the ICR. We found that, on the paternal chromosome, enhancers interact with the Igf2 promoters but that, on the maternal allele, this is prevented by CTCF binding within the H19 ICR. CTCF binding in the maternal ICR regulates its interaction with matrix attachment region (MAR)3 and DMR1 at Igf2, thus forming a tight loop around the maternal Igf2 locus, which may contribute to its silencing. Mutation of CTCF binding sites in the H19 ICR leads to loss of CTCF binding and de novo methylation of a CTCF target site within Igf2 DMR1, showing that CTCF can coordinate regional epigenetic marks. This systematic chromosome conformation capture analysis of an imprinting cluster reveals that CTCF has a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of higher-order chromatin structure and gene silencing over considerable distances in the genome.",

To address the impact of genotype on the epigenome, we performed a detailed study in 128 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) and 128 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins, interrogating the DNA methylation status of the ICRs of IGF2, H19, KCNQ1, GNAS and the non-imprinted gene RUNX1. While we found a similar overall pattern of methylation between MZ and DZ twins, we also observed a high degree of variability in individual CpG methylation levels, notably at the H19/IGF2 loci. A degree of methylation plasticity independent of the genome sequence was observed, with both local and regional CpG methylation changes, discordant between MZ and DZ individual pairs. However, concordant gains or losses of methylation, within individual twin pairs were more common in MZ than DZ twin pairs, indicating that de novo and/or maintenance methylation is influenced by the underlying DNA sequence. Specifically, for the first time we showed that the rs10732516 [A] polymorphism, located in a critical CTCF binding site in the H19 ICR locus, is strongly associated with increased hypermethylation of specific CpG sites in the maternal H19 allele. Together, our results highlight the impact of the genome on the epigenome and demonstrate that while DNA methylation states are tightly maintained between genetically identical and related individuals, there remains considerable epigenetic variation that may contribute to disease susceptibility.",

Most bone-quality data for PTH is from teriparatide. Teriparatide results in a rapid increase in bone-formation markers, followed by increases in bone-resorption markers, opening an \"anabolic window,\" a period of time when PTH is maximally anabolic. Teriparatide reverses the structural damage seen in osteoporosis and restores the structure of trabecular bone. It has a positive effect on cortical bone, and any early increases in cortical porosity appear to be offset by increases in cortical thickness and diameter. Bisphosphonates are antiresorptive agents which reduce bone turnover, improve trabecular microarchitecture, and mineralization. Concerns have been raised that the prolonged antiresorptive action of bisphosphonates may lead to failure to repair microdamage, resulting in microcracks and atypical fragility. Strontium ranelate is thought to have a mixed mode of action, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Strontium ranelate improves cortical thickness, trabecular number, and connectivity, with no change in cortical porosity. Denosumab exerts rapid, marked, and sustained effects on bone resorption, resulting in falls in the markers of bone turnover. Evidence from bone-quality studies suggests that treatment-naive women, aged 60-65 years, with very low BMD T scores may benefit from PTH as primary therapy to improve bone substrate and build bone. Post-PTH treatment with bisphosphonates will maintain improvements in bone quality and reduce the risk of fracture.",

The anabolic agents currently in clinical use are reviewed. Teriparatide (recombinant human 1-34 parathyroid hormone) is used to treat women with menopausal osteoporosis and men at high risk for fractures. Despite PTH's clinical use, the mechanism underlying its anabolic action requires greater elucidation. Proteol (strontium ranelate) acts by inhibiting bone resorption and presumably promoting bone formation. Though clinical trials have shown that strontium ranelate reduces the frequency of both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, its molecular target remains controversial. Lately, with the discontinuation of estrogen replacement therapy, phytoestrogens are gaining much attention, chiefly as prophylactic agents. Though ipriflavone stimulates osteoblast function in vitro and favorably influences bone turnover and spinal bone mineral density in peri- and postmenopausal women, its clinical use is currently rather limited. As with PTH and strontium ranelate, the mode of action of ipriflavone requires much greater elucidation. Since osteoporosis therapies are long-term, safety is a major consideration. PTH has been reported to be associated with incidence of osteosarcoma and strontium ranelate with DRESS syndrome. Therefore, target-based (and osteoblast-specific) development of molecules is expected to improve the safety profile of anabolics.

It is recommended for use in post-menopausal women (PMW), men with hypogonadal osteoporosis, as well as men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. In vivo studies have generated important findings regarding teriparatide's role in the enhancement of fracture healing. The intention of this article is to review the clinical findings of teriparatide to stimulate fracture healing. The drug was shown in a prospective randomized, double blind study to achieve earlier radiographic cortical bridging of three of four cortices (7.4 weeks) compared to patients who were assigned to the placebo group (9.1 weeks). Another study compared mean time for healing and functional outcome in two groups of elderly women who had suffered osteoporotic pelvic fractures: one group received daily 100 \u03bcg parathyroid hormone (1-84) injections, while the other group received no treatment. Patients who received the PTH (1-84) injections accelerated radiographic and clinical fracture healing (7.8 weeks) when compared to patients who received no treatment (12.6 weeks, p&lt;0.001). Numerous case series state the safety and potential benefits of teriparatide use in patients recovering from fractures. In the following scenarios, teriparatide might be considered in patients with osteoporosis and a fracture: (1) patients with severe osteoporosis with use of bisphosphonates for a number of years with a fracture not expected to predictably unite, e.g. atypical femur fracture or open tibia fracture, (2) in cases where an osteoporotic patient has failed fracture healing and is considering surgical treatment e.g. non-union surgery. It seems prudent to reevaluate these patients frequently and reconsider which drug class of osteoporotic drug is best for the patient. Finally, it must be stressed that we do not recommend teriparatide in osteoporotic patients that may be well treated with bisphosphonates and a fracture is expected to heal uneventfully, nor when patients with metabolically normal bone have a fracture.",

We compared the effects of teriparatide and the bisphosphonate risedronate on bone metabolism using two ovariectomized rat models to elucidate the optimal use of these two drugs in the clinical setting. We first performed dose-finding experiments to determine the equivalent effective doses of each drug (5.6 and 3.0 \u00b5g/kg for teriparatide and risedronate, respectively). We then compared the effects of these doses on bone metabolism after subcutaneous administration three times weekly for 4 months starting either the day after ovariectomy (preventive study) or 12 months after ovariectomy (therapeutic study). The increase in proximal tibial BMD under the physical conditions that increased bone turnover at 1 to 2 months after ovariectomy was greater in the risedronate group than in the teriparatide group.

Data were analyzed by two-sample tests. Histomorphometric indices of bone formation were significantly and markedly greater in the teriparatide group than in the alendronate group at 6 and 18 months, whereas indices of bone resorption were only significantly greater in the teriparatide group than in the alendronate group at 6 months. Bone formation and activation frequency were significantly lower at 18 months compared with 6 months in the teriparatide group, returning to levels comparable with untreated postmenopausal women. In the teriparatide group, the peak in histomorphometric bone formation indices coincided with peak levels for N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen, a biochemical marker of bone formation. The degree of mineralization was lower at 18 months than at 6 months with treatment in both groups but was not different between groups. These results confirm the opposite mechanisms of action of teriparatide and alendronate on bone remodeling and confirm the bone formation effect of teriparatide.",

Teriparatide, a recombinant human parathyroid hormone, has recently become available. It has an altogether different action. Teriparatide is an anabolic agent that primarily stimulates bone formation. This leads to an increase in bone volume and the bone structure and microarchitecture is restored by an increase in trabecular thickness and an increase in the number of connections between trabeculae. Clinically relevant studies on teriparatide in postmenopausal women and in men have shown that it significantly lowers the risk of fracture. Teriparatide should not be combined with bisphosphonates. There are no clear recommendations on the order of treatment with teriparatide and bisphosphonates. The high costs ofteriparatide have slowed the trajectory from registration to reimbursement in the Netherlands. Since 1 February 2005 teriparatide may be prescribed for postmenopausal women with serious osteoporosis i.e. with a minimum of 1 osteoporotic fracture who (a) despite treatment with bisphosphonates or raloxifene after 2 prolapsed vertebrae once again have 1 or more fractures (inadequate response); (b) can tolerate neither bisphosphonates nor raloxifene; (c) are prescribed the drug by their treating medical specialist.",

It can decrease the occurrence of fracture in the subjects with increased fracture risks. Teriparatide can provide good protection against fracture using as monotherapy, and possibly as combination with an antiresorptive agent such as zoledronate. Teriparatide should be considered in patients with osteoporosis who sustained the reduction of BMD or fracture on established bisphosphonates or SERMs. Treatment period of teriparatide is 1.5-2 years and consecutive use of antiresorptive agents is greatly recommended to secure long-term protection against fracture after teriparatide treatment.",

Teriparatide may also have a direct effect on bone pain. Teriparatide may be initiating immediately after an anticatabolic agent. However, it is not recommended to associate both treatments. At the end of teripatide treatment, an anticatabolic agent may be given.

The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity. We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.

The advent of many new somatic variant callers creates a need for comparison and validation of the tools, as no de facto standard for detection of somatic mutations exists and only limited comparisons have been reported. We have performed a comprehensive evaluation using exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing data of paired tumor-normal samples from five breast cancer patients to evaluate the performance of nine publicly available somatic variant callers: EBCall, Mutect, Seurat, Shimmer, Indelocator, Somatic Sniper, Strelka, VarScan 2 and Virmid for the detection of single nucleotide mutations and small deletions and insertions. We report a large variation in the number of calls from the nine somatic variant callers on the same sequencing data and highly variable agreement. Sequencing depth had markedly diverse impact on individual callers, as for some callers, increased sequencing depth highly improved sensitivity. For SNV calling, we report EBCall, Mutect, Virmid and Strelka to be the most reliable somatic variant callers for both exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing. For indel calling, EBCall is superior due to high sensitivity and robustness to changes in sequencing depths.",

Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in DNA sequencing data is confounded by germline polymorphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic SNV sites in matched cancer-normal sequencing datasets are VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix and Strelka. In this analysis, we apply these four SNV calling algorithms to cancer-normal Illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. The candidate SNV sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each SNV calling algorithm. Comparing the candidate SNV sets returned by VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2 and Strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates.

The four tools returned poor consensus on candidates (only 20% of calls were with multiple hits by the callers). For both WES and UDT-Seq, MuTect2 and Strelka obtained the largest proportion of COSMIC entries as well as the lowest rate of dbSNP presence and high-alternative-alleles-in-control calls, demonstrating their superior sensitivity and accuracy. Combining different callers does increase reliability of candidates, but narrows the list down to very limited range of tumor read depth and variant allele frequency. Calling SNV on UDT-Seq data, which were of much higher read-depth, discovered additional true-positive variations, despite an even more tremendous growth in false positive predictions. Our findings not only provide valuable benchmark for state-of-the-art SNV calling methods, but also shed light on the access to more accurate SNV identification in the future.",

Here, we constructed a new pipeline. We combined two different somatic variant callers with different algorithms, Strelka and VarScan 2, and evaluated performance using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 19 Japanese cases with gastric cancer (GC); then, we characterized these tumors based on identified driver molecular alterations. More single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions were detected by Strelka and VarScan 2, respectively. SNVs detected by both tools showed higher accuracy for estimating somatic variants compared with those detected by only one of the two tools and accurately showed the mutation signature and mutations of driver genes reported for GC. Our combinatorial pipeline may have an advantage in detection of somatic mutations in GC and may be useful for further genomic characterization of Japanese patients with GC to improve the efficacy of GC treatments.

A crucial first step in this process is the reliable identification of cancer-relevant variants, which is considerably complicated by the impurity and heterogeneity of clinical tumor samples. We compared the impact of admixture of non-cancerous cells and low somatic allele frequencies on the sensitivity and precision of 19 state-of-the-art SNV callers. We studied both whole exome and targeted gene panel data and up to 13 distinct parameter configurations for each tool. We found vast differences among callers. Based on our comprehensive analyses we recommend joint tumor-normal calling with MuTect, EBCall or Strelka for whole exome somatic variant calling, and HaplotypeCaller or FreeBayes for whole exome germline calling. For targeted gene panel data on a single tumor sample, LoFreqStar performed best. We further found that tumor impurity and admixture had a negative impact on precision, and in particular, sensitivity in whole exome experiments. At admixture levels of 60% to 90% sometimes seen in pathological biopsies, sensitivity dropped significantly, even when variants were originally present in the tumor at 100% allele frequency. Sensitivity to low-frequency SNVs improved with targeted panel data, but whole exome data allowed more efficient identification of germline variants. Effective somatic variant calling requires high-quality pathological samples with minimal admixture, a consciously selected sequencing strategy, and the appropriate variant calling tool with settings optimized for the chosen type of data.",

Associations between DNA alterations and outcome were evaluated by logistic and Cox-proportional hazards regression. There were no recurrent single gene mutations significantly associated with pathologic complete response (pCR), except PIK3CA [odds ratio (OR) = 0.42, P = 0.0185]. Mutations in 33 of 714 pathways were significantly associated with response, but different genes were affected in different individuals. PIK3CA was present in 23 of these pathways defining a \u2018trastuzumab resistance-network\u2019 of 459 genes.

Mutations in the \u2018Regulation of RhoA activity\u2019 pathway were associated with higher pCR rate to lapatinib (OR = 14.8, adjusted P = 0.001), lapatinib + trastuzumab (OR = 3.0, adjusted P = 0.09), and all arms combined (OR = 3.77, adjusted P = 0.02). Patients (n = 124) with mutations in the trastuzumab resistance network but intact RhoA pathway had 2% (1/41) pCR rate with trastuzumab alone (OR = 0.026, P = 0.001) but adding lapatinib increased pCR rate to 45% (17/38, OR = 1.68, P = 0.3). Patients (n = 46) who had no mutations in either gene set had 6% pCR rate (1/15) with lapatinib, but had the highest pCR rate, 52% (8/15) with trastuzumab alone. Mutations in the RhoA pathway are associated with pCR to lapatinib and mutations in a PIK3CA-related network are associated with resistance to trastuzumab. The combined mutation status of these two pathways could define patients with very low response rate to trastuzumab alone that can be augmented by adding lapatinib or substituting trastuzumab with lapatinib.",

Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance.

Lymphedema volumes calculated by utilizing the formula for a truncated cone decreased by 16% on the left side and 12% on the right side for the first patient and 31 and 17% for the second. Hand circumference decreased 4.3 cm on the left side and 3.2 cm on the right side in case 1, and 2.5 cm and 1.9 cm respectively for case 2. The patients were taught self-bandaging techniques during their hospital stays. Elastic gloves were fitted at the end of treatment. Reduction of lymphedema volume remained stable after 18 months in one patient while for the second patient further treatment and hospitalization were required due to poor compliance. The pathogenesis of this edema is probably multifactorial: venous, lymphatic insufficiency and the direct toxicity of injected drugs. Lymphedema treatment currently consists of low-stretch bandaging and wearing elastic garments, which is effective in decreasing the volume of puffy hand syndrome.",

Intravenous injections of drugs can cause venous thrombosis, and septic or embolic complications. The puffy hand sign is a more uncommon complication of hard-core injection addicts. Three long-term intravenous drug users, two males, one female, mean age 30.6 years (26-37) presented puffy hands. These patients had been drug addicts for four to twelve years (mean duration 7.3 years) and had stopped heroin injections for 3-5 years (mean 4.6), participating in a buprenorphine substitution program. The edema appeared several years after drug cessation (1.5-5, mean 2.3). Typically the puffiness was bilateral, the hands swollen from the proximal segments of the fingers to the wrist. In one patient, the edema was localized both in the hands and in the feet. The edema was not pitting and unaffected by elevation. Duplex ultrasound examination of the extremities was normal. Lymphangiography performed in one patient was consistent with deep lymphatic destruction. Puffy hand syndrome appears to be the end result of lymphatic obstruction. Repeated injections of drugs in or outside the veins destroy the lymphatics. Buprenorphine may play an important role in the puffy hand sign. Although it is supposed to be administered orally, many drug addicts use it as an i.v. solution. Because buprenorphine is poorly soluble, it causes lymphatic obstruction. This type of hand for which no therapy exists must be differentiated from deep palmar space infection with dorsal edema which requires incision and drainage.",

Furthermore, chronic but not acute inflammatory signals increased S1P<sub>1</sub> expression, while the enzymes that control tissue S1P levels in mice and humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were uniformly dysregulated, favoring synthesis over degradation. Finally, we observed that FTY720 reduced T-cell velocity and induced S1P<sub>1</sub> degradation and retention of Na\u00efve but not effector T cells. Our data demonstrate that chronic inflammation modulates S1P<sub>1</sub> expression and tissue S1P levels and suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of S1PR agonists might not be solely due to their lymphopenic effects, but also due to potential effects on DC migration and vascular barrier function.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28147349": " In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a pivotal step in the initiation and perpetuation of mucosal inflammation entails the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the gut. Understanding the carefully coordinated series of molecular events that culminate in the recruitment of leukocytes to the gut has resulted in novel interventions with new capabilities in treating both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Key Messages: Natalizumab, an anti-\u03b14 integrin antibody, was the first agent to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for the induction and maintenance of response and remission in Crohn's disease. Widespread adoption was mitigated by the previously unknown risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with this approach. Current approaches employ a more selective inhibition of adhesion molecules targeting the gut to avoid broad suppression of surveillance for JC virus, the causal pathogen of PML. Subsequently, vedolizumab, a humanized anti-\u03b14\u03b27 integrin antibody, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with IBD and has an excellent safety profile. To date, there have been no cases of PML in patients treated with vedolizumab, suggesting that this more selective agent does not have the same risk for PML as natalizumab. Other agents target \u03b27 integrin (etrolizumab) and mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1, the endothelial ligand of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin. Efforts to inhibit the chemokine receptor CCR9 using the agent CCX282-B in Crohn's disease were not successful. An orally administered anti-\u03b14 integrin compound showed some promise in a phase 2 trial but raises concern for PML. Finally, the S1P1 receptor agonist ozanimod showed promise in early trials in ulcerative colitis. In summary, anti-trafficking agents have the potential to provide safe and effective therapy for IBD, and are a burgeoning class of novel agents.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279838": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, involve an inappropriate immune reaction in the digestive tract, causing a variety of disabling symptoms. The advent of monoclonal antibodies (anti-tumor necrosis factor, anti-integrin, anti-interleukin -23) has revolutionized IBD management. Nevertheless, these agents, with potential for immunogenicity, are associated with high rates of response loss and disease relapse over time. They are also associated with high production costs. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a membrane-derived lysophospholipid signaling molecule, is implicated in a vast array of physiological and pathophysiological processes, primarily via extracellular activation of S1P1-S1P5 receptors. S1P1, S1P4 and S1P5 are involved in regulation of the immune system, while S1P2 and S1P3 may be associated with cardiovascular, pulmonary, and theoretical cancer-related risks. Targeting S1P receptors for inflammatory conditions has been successful in clinical trials leading to approval of the non-selective S1P modulator, fingolimod, for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. However, the association of this non-selective S1P modulator with serious adverse events provides the rationale for developing more selective S1P receptor modulators. Until recently, three S1P modulators with differing selectivity for S1P receptors were in clinical development for IBD: ozanimod (RPC1063), etrasimod (APD334) and amiselimod (MT-1303). The development of amiselimod has been stopped as Biogen are currently focusing on other drugs in its portfolio. Following encouraging results from the Phase 2 TOUCHSTONE trial, a Phase 3 trial of the S1P modulator ozanimod in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis is ongoing. Etrasimod is also being tested in a phase 2 trial in ulcerative colitis. These pipeline medications can be administered orally and may avoid the formation of anti-drug antibodies that can lead to treatment failure with injectable biologic therapies for IBD. Data from ongoing clinical trials will establish the relationship between the selectivity of S1P modulators and their safety and efficacy in IBD, as well as their potential place in the clinical armamentarium for IBD.",

Ozanimod is an oral selective modulator of S1P<sub>1R</sub> and S1P<sub>5R</sub> receptors in clinical development for the treatment of chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory diseases. This first-in-human study characterized the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ozanimod in 88 healthy volunteers using a range of single and multiple doses (7 and 28 days) and a dose-escalation regimen. Ozanimod was generally well tolerated up to a maximum single dose of 3 mg and multiple doses of 2 mg/d, with no severe adverse events (AEs) and no dose-limiting toxicities. The most common ozanimod-related AEs included headache, somnolence, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Ozanimod exhibited linear PK, high steady-state volume of distribution (73-101 L/kg), moderate oral clearance (204-227 L/h), and an elimination half-life of approximately 17 to 21 hours. Ozanimod produced a robust dose-dependent reduction in total peripheral lymphocytes, with a median decrease of 65% to 68% observed after 28 days of dosing at 1 and 1.5 mg/d, respectively. Ozanimod selectivity affected lymphocyte subtypes, causing marked decreases in cells expressing CCR7 and variable decreases in subsets lacking CCR7. A dose-dependent negative chronotropic effect was observed following the first dose, with the dose-escalation regimen attenuating the first-dose negative chronotropic effect.

Targeting molecules involved in leukocyte traffic has recently become an effective and well tolerated strategy for the treatment of IBD. Novel approaches now not only target the integrins on the lymphocyte surface, but also its endothelial ligand: MAdCAM-1. As with vedolizumab, antibodies against MAdCAM-1 appear most effective in ulcerative colitis rather than in Crohn's. Targeting chemokines or their receptors does not appear to have the same efficacy as those that target the most stable integrin: immunoglobulin superfamily interactions between the lymphocyte and endothelium. Preliminary results also suggest that the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway might also be targeted therapeutically in IBD, no longer with parenterally administered antibodies but with orally administered small molecules.",

Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive ozanimod at a dose of 0.5 mg or 1 mg or placebo daily for up to 32 weeks. The Mayo Clinic score was used to measure disease activity on a scale from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease; subscores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The primary outcome was clinical remission (Mayo Clinic score \u22642, with no subscore &gt;1) at 8 weeks.

Differences in the primary outcome between the group that received 0.5 mg of ozanimod and the placebo group were not significant; therefore, the hierarchical testing plan deemed the analyses of secondary outcomes exploratory. Clinical response (decrease in Mayo Clinic score of \u22653 points and \u226530% and decrease in rectal-bleeding subscore of \u22651 point or a subscore \u22641) at 8 weeks occurred in 57% of those receiving 1 mg of ozanimod and 54% of those receiving 0.5 mg, as compared with 37% of those receiving placebo.

NCCT markers independently predicted ICH expansion (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) with overall accuracy ranging from 61% to 78% and good interrater reliability (<i>k</i> &gt; 0.6 for all markers). There was no evidence of an interaction between NCCT markers and benefit from intensive BP reduction (all <i>p</i> for interaction &gt;0.10). NCCT signs reliably identify ICH patients at high risk of hematoma growth. However, we found no evidence that patients with these markers specifically benefit from intensive BP reduction. <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01176565\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01176565</a>.",

Patients admitted in our ICU from 2002 to 2010 for spontaneous ICH and placed under mechanical ventilation were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 72 patients, 49% evolved to BD, 39% died after withdrawal of life support, and 12% were discharged alive. The most discriminating characteristics to predict BD were included in two models; Model 1 contained \u22653 abolished brainstem responses [adjusted odds ratios (OR) = 8.4 (2.4, 29.1)] and the swirl sign on the baseline CT-scan [adjusted OR = 5.0 (1.6, 15.9)] and Model 2 addressed the abolition of corneal reflexes [unilateral/bilateral: adjusted OR = 4.2 (0.9, 20.1)/8.8 (2.4, 32.3)] and the swirl sign on the baseline CT-scan [adjusted OR = 6.2 (1.9, 20.0)]. Two scores predicting BD were created (sensitivity: 0.89 and 0.88, specificity: 0.68 and 0.65). Risk of evolution toward BD was classified as low (corneal reflexes present and no swirl sign), high (\u22651 corneal reflexes abolished and swirl sign), and intermediate. Simple signs at ICU admission can predict BD in comatose patients with ICH and could increase the potential for organ donation.",

Computed tomographic (CT) findings, should be carefully studied because early diagnosis and treatment of oral anticoagulant use-associated hematomas are vitally important. In the present study, CT findings of intraparenchymal hematomas associated with anticoagulant and antihypertensive use are presented. This study included 45 patients (25 men, 20 women) under anticoagulant (21 patients) or antihypertensive (24 patients) treatment who had brain CT examinations due to complaints and findings suggesting cerebrovascular disease during July 2010-October 2013 period. CT examinations were performed to determine hematoma volumes and presence of swirl sign, hematocrit effect, mid-line shift effect, and intraventricular extension. The patients were 40-89 years of age. In four cases, a total of 51 intraparenchymal hematomas (42 cerebral, 7 cerebellar and 2 brain stem) were detected in multiple foci. Hematoma volumes varied from 0.09 to 284.00 ml. Swirl sign was observed in 87.5 and 63.0 % of OAC-associated ICHs and non-OAC-associated ICHs, respectively. In addition, hematocrit effect was observed in 41.6 % of OAC-associated and in 3.7 % of non-OAC-associated ICHs. Volume increases were observed in all 19 hematomas where swirl sign was detected, and follow-up CT scanning was conducted. Mortality of OAC-associated ICHs was correlated with initial volumes of hematoma, mid-line shift amount, and intraventricular extension. Detection of hematocrit effect by CT scanning of intracranial hematomas should be cautionary in oral anticoagulant use, while detection of swirl sign should be suggestive of active hemorrhage.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of the swirl sign among patients with acute epidural hematoma (AEDH) and to identify its prognostic value and impact on surgical treatment. A retrospective review was performed of patients with a diagnosis of traumatic EDH by CT scan who were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery of the First People's Hospital of Jingmen between January 2010 and January 2014. Patients with combined or open craniocerebral injuries and those who did not undergo surgical treatment were excluded. Of the 147 patients evaluated, 21 (14%) exhibited the swirl sign on non-enhanced CT scans of the brain. Univariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between the occurrence of the swirl sign and preoperative Glasgow coma scale scores, preoperative mydriasis, time from injury to CT scan, and intraoperative hematoma volume. Compared with patients without this sign, those exhibiting the swirl sign had a higher mortality rate (24 vs. 6%, respectively; P = 0.028) and a worse outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score \u2264 3: 38 vs. 15%, respectively; P = 0.027) at 3 months. An adjusted analysis showed that the occurrence of the swirl sign was an independent predictor of poor outcome (death: odds ratio (OR) = 4.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-15.82; P &lt; 0.05; 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score \u2264 3: OR = 3.47; 95% CI: 1.27-9.49; P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the occurrence of the swirl sign on the head CT scan of patients with AEDH was found to be significantly associated with poor outcome.

We conducted a retrospective case notes review of 35 patients referred to our multidisciplinary psycho-dermatology clinic at the Royal London Hospital between January 2004 and January 2017. The majority of patients were women (25) 71.4%, with a mean age of 54.6 years (26-80 years). Most (26) 74.2% were living alone. The average duration of illness prior to presentation was 3.8 years (4 months-20 years). Many patients had perceived precipitating factors (54.2%) and often self-diagnosed (28.5%). Psychiatric co-morbidities included 42.8% with depressive symptoms and 25.7% with anxiety. Substance misuse was elicited in five patients (14%). Management of patients included both the treatment of skin disease and psychosocial co-morbidities. Out of the 35 patients who attended (14) 40% cleared or showed significant improvement.

Previously, spirochetes have been detected in the dermatological specimens from four MD patients, thus providing evidence of an infectious process. Based on culture, histology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and molecular testing, we present corroborating evidence of spirochetal infection in a larger group of 25 MD patients. Irrespective of Lyme serological reactivity, all patients in our study group demonstrated histological evidence of epithelial spirochetal infection.

Spirochetes identified as Borrelia strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or in-situ DNA hybridization were detected in 24/25 of our study patients. Skin cultures containing Borrelia spirochetes were obtained from four patients, thus demonstrating that the organisms present in dermatological specimens were viable. Spirochetes identified by PCR as Borrelia burgdorferi were cultured from blood in seven patients and from vaginal secretions in three patients, demonstrating systemic infection. Based on these observations, a clinical classification system for MD is proposed.

Thus far, ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and introns have been the most widely used noncoding markers. Here we analyze and study the evolutionary properties of a new type of noncoding marker, conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which consists of noncoding elements that are estimated to evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species. Although they often include UCEs, CNEEs are distinct from UCEs because they are not ultraconserved, and, most importantly, the core region alone is analyzed, rather than both the core and its flanking regions. Using a data set of 16 birds plus an alligator outgroup, and \u223c3600-\u223c3800 loci per marker type, we found that although CNEEs were less variable than bioinformatically derived UCEs or introns and in some cases exhibited a slower approach to branch resolution as determined by phylogenomic subsampling, the quality of CNEE alignments was superior to those of the other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species. Phylogenetic resolution using coalescent approaches was comparable among the three marker types, with most nodes being fully and congruently resolved. Comparison of phylogenetic results across the three marker types indicated that one branch, the sister group to the passerine + falcon clade, was resolved differently and with moderate (&gt;70%) bootstrap support between CNEEs and UCEs or introns. Overall, CNEEs appear to be promising as phylogenomic markers, yielding phylogenetic resolution as high as for UCEs and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments and with patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis.",

However, these two sets of loci have minimal overlap with each other; moreover, they do not include many traditional loci that that have been used for phylogenetics.

Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains.",

Here, we use microarrays to examine the contribution of these essential GRFs to transcription genome-wide, by using ts mutants that dissociate from their binding sites at 37 degrees C. We then combine this data with published ChIP-chip studies and motif analysis to identify probable direct targets for Abf1 and Rap1. We also identify a substantial number of genes likely to bind Rap1 or Abf1, but not affected by loss of GRF binding. Interestingly, the results strongly suggest that Rap1 can contribute to gene activation from farther upstream than can Abf1. Also, consistent with previous work, more genes that bind Abf1 are unaffected by loss of binding than those that bind Rap1. Finally, we show for several such genes that the Abf1 C-terminal region, which contains the putative activation domain, is not needed to confer this peculiar 'memory effect' that allows continued transcription after loss of Abf1 binding.",

Here, we use high resolution tiling arrays to examine the contributions of two general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, to nucleosome occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors have each been shown to bind to a few hundred promoters, but we find here that thousands of loci show localized regions of altered nucleosome occupancy within 1 h of loss of Abf1 or Rap1 binding, and that altered chromatin structure can occur via binding sites having a wide range of affinities.

We found that nucleosomes and specific DNA-binding proteins, including the general regulatory factors (GRFs) Reb1p, Rap1p, and Abf1p, and Pol III transcription factors enhance the efficiency of NNS termination by physically blocking Pol II progression. The same DNA-bound factors that promote NNS termination were shown previously to define the 3'-ends of Okazaki fragments synthesized by Pol \u03b4 during DNA replication. Reduced binding of these factors results in defective NNS termination and Pol II readthrough. Furthermore, inactivating NNS enables Pol II elongation through these roadblocks, demonstrating that effective Pol II termination depends on a synergy between the NNS machinery and obstacles in chromatin. Consistent with this finding, loci exhibiting Pol II readthrough at GRF binding sites are depleted for upstream NNS signals.

In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these regions are adjacent to binding sites for general regulatory transcription factors, and the Reb1 protein is commonly bound to promoter DNA near such regions. The yeast TFC6 promoter is a unique RNA polymerase II promoter in that it is autoregulated by its own gene product Tfc6p, which is part of the RNA polymerase III transcription factor complex TFIIIC. We previously demonstrated that mutation of a potential Reb1 binding site adjacent to the TFIIIC binding site in the TFC6 promoter modestly reduces transcript levels, but leads to a severe decrease in Tfc6 protein levels due to an upstream shift in the TFC6 transcription start site. Here we confirm that Reb1p indeed binds to the TFC6 promoter, and is important for proper transcription start site selection and protein expression. Interestingly, loss of Reb1p association at this site has a similar effect on the adjacent divergently transcribed ESC2 promoter, resulting in a significant increase of 5'-extended ESC2 transcripts and reduction of Esc2 protein levels. This altered divergent transcription may be the result of changes in nucleosome positioning at this locus in the absence of Reb1p binding. We speculate that an important function of general regulatory factors such as Reb1p is to establish and maintain proper transcription start sites at promoters, and that when binding of such factors is compromised, resulting effects on mRNA translation may be an underappreciated aspect of gene regulation studies.",

Two cis-acting elements called PAC and RRPE are known to mediate Ribi gene repression in response to nutritional downshift. Here, we show that most Ribi gene promoters also contain binding sites for one or more General Regulatory Factors (GRFs), most frequently Abf1 and Reb1, and that these factors are enriched in vivo at Ribi promoters. Abf1/Reb1/Tbf1 promoter association was required for full Ribi gene expression in rich medium and for its modulation in response to glucose starvation, characterized by a rapid drop followed by slow recovery. Such a response did not entail changes in Abf1 occupancy, but it was paralleled by a quick increase, followed by slow decrease, in Rpd3L histone deacetylase occupancy. Remarkably, Abf1 site disruption also abolished Rpd3L complex recruitment in response to starvation. Extensive mutational analysis of the DBP7 promoter revealed a complex interplay of Tbf1 sites, PAC and RRPE in the transcriptional regulation of this Ribi gene. Our observations point to GRFs as new multifaceted players in Ribi gene regulation both during exponential growth and under repressive conditions.",

A recent study showed that unlike Rap1, whose association with RP gene promoters is not affected by environmental changes causing RP gene repression/reactivation, Abf1 association with both RP gene and ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells.",

Intriguingly, Abf1 binding to Ribi genes is differentially modulated in response to distinct nutrition signaling pathways. Such a dynamic promoter association has the potential to orchestrate both activation and repression of Ribi genes in synergy with neighboring regulatory sites and through the functional interplay of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases.",

Here we systematically consider the lysogeny-lysis CRMs of different temperate bacteriophages such as the Lactobacillus casei phage A2, Escherichia coli phages lambda, and 186 and Lactococcal phage TP901-1. This study allowed explaining a recent experimental puzzle on the role of Cro protein in the lambda switch. Several general conclusions have been drawn: 1), long-range interactions, multilayer assembly and DNA looping may lead to complex GRFs that cannot be described by linear functions of binding site occupancies; 2), in general, GRFs cannot be described by the Boolean logic, whereas a three-state non-Boolean logic suffices for the studied examples; 3), studied CRMs of the intact phages seemed to have a similar GRF topology (the number of plateaus and peaks corresponding to different expression regimes); we hypothesize that functionally equivalent CRMs might have topologically equivalent GRFs for a larger class of genetic systems; and 4) within a given GRF class, a set of mechanistic-to-mathematical transformations has been identified, which allows shaping the GRF before carrying out a system-level analysis.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21914852": "The packaging of eukaryotic genomes into nuclesomes plays critical roles in chromatin organization and gene regulation. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that nucleosome occupancy is partially encoded by intrinsic antinucleosomal DNA sequences, such as poly(A) sequences, as well as by binding sites for trans-acting factors that can evict nucleosomes, such as Reb1 and the Rsc3/30 complex. Here, we use genome-wide nucleosome occupancy maps in 13 Ascomycota fungi to discover large-scale evolutionary reprogramming of both intrinsic and trans determinants of chromatin structure. We find that poly(G)s act as intrinsic antinucleosomal sequences, comparable to the known function of poly(A)s, but that the abundance of poly(G)s has diverged greatly between species, obscuring their antinucleosomal effect in low-poly(G) species such as S. cerevisiae. We also develop a computational method that uses nucleosome occupancy maps for discovering trans-acting general regulatory factor (GRF) binding sites. Our approach reveals that the specific sequences bound by GRFs have diverged substantially across evolution, corresponding to a number of major evolutionary transitions in the repertoire of GRFs. We experimentally validate a proposed evolutionary transition from Cbf1 as a major GRF in pre-whole-genome duplication (WGD) yeasts to Reb1 in post-WGD yeasts. We further show that the mating type switch-activating protein Sap1 is a GRF in S. pombe, demonstrating the general applicability of our approach. Our results reveal that the underlying mechanisms that determine in vivo chromatin organization have diverged and that comparative genomics can help discover new determinants of chromatin organization.",

Heterophile antibody tests, including the Monospot test, are red cell or latex agglutination assays, which detect antired cell antibodies produced as part of a polyclonal antibody response occurring during EBV infection. Heterophile antibody tests are rapid, cheap and specific tests that can be performed from the onset of symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. In adolescents, heterophile antibody tests have high specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of primary acute EBV infection. However, the tests have low sensitivity and low negative predictive value in young children and are not useful under the age of 4. Heterophile tests may be positive in other viral infections, autoimmune disease and haematological malignancies, but do not appear to be positive in primary bacterial infection. Virus-specific serology is required in children under the age of 4 or if an older child is heterophile negative. Virus-specific serology allows diagnosis and the pattern of positivity and negativity enables the clinician to stage the EBV infection. Virus-specific serology appears to have better sensitivity in young children, but there is cross-reaction with other herpesvirus infections, a longer turnaround time and it is more expensive to perform. Further research is needed to establish which children benefit from and hence require testing for heterophile antibodies, the cost-effectiveness of EBV investigations and whether heterophile titres have predictive value for the severity of infection and the likelihood of complications.",

Twelve studies, deriving from extended search in PubMed, were included. Nine studies provided diagnosis data. The evaluated diagnostic methods were real-time PCR (RT-PCR), IgM/IgG antibodies measured with different assays [measurement of Epstein-Barr virus viral load (EBV-VL) in peripheral blood, neutrophil/lymphocyte/monocyte counts, C-reactive protein values, and monospot test]. The sensitivities reported for RT-PCR were high. The available treatment data were scarce (three studies).

While increasingly sophisticated immunotherapy targeting soluble and aggregated brain amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) continues to dominate clinical research in AD, a deeper understanding of A\u03b2 physiology has led to the recognition of distinct neuronal signaling pathways linking A\u03b2 to synaptotoxicity and neurodegeneration and to new targets for therapeutic intervention. Identifying specific signaling pathways involving A\u03b2 has allowed for the development of more precise therapeutic interventions targeting the most relevant molecular mechanisms leading to AD. In this review, I highlight the discovery of cellular prion protein as a high-affinity receptor for A\u03b2 oligomers, and the downstream signaling pathway elucidated to date, converging on nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn. I discuss preclinical studies targeting Fyn as a therapeutic intervention in AD and our recent experience with the safety, tolerability, and cerebrospinal fluid penetration of the Src family kinase inhibitor saracatinib in patients with AD. Fyn is an attractive target for AD therapeutics, not only based on its activation by A\u03b2 via cellular prion protein but also due to its known interaction with tau, uniquely linking the two key pathologies in AD. Fyn is also a challenging target, with broad expression throughout the body and significant homology with other members of the Src family kinases, which may lead to unintended off-target effects.

Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Their function and distribution around important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to 3D conformation of these loci. Here, we show that clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements.

Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a mixture of polyclonal IgG antibodies isolated and pooled from thousands of healthy human donors. The scientific rationale for testing IVIG as a potential AD treatment include its natural anti-A\u03b2 antibody activity, its favorable safety profile and inherent anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory properties. Over the past decade, several clinical and pre-clinical experimental findings, advanced our knowledge about biological and therapeutic properties of IVIG that are relevant to AD therapy. Anti-amyloid antibodies in IVIG show significantly higher binding avidity for amyloid oligomers and fibrils than for A\u03b2 monomers. In a double transgenic murine model of AD, intracerebral injection of IVIG causes suppression of A\u03b2 fibril pathology whereas long term peripheral IVIG treatments causes elevation of total brain A\u03b2 levels with no measurable impact on A\u03b2 deposits or tendency for inducing cerebral microhemmorhage. Furthermore, chronic IVIG treatment suppressed neuroinflammation and fostered adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In clinical studies with AD patients, IVIG showed an acceptable safety profile and has not been reported to increase the incidence of amyloid related imaging abnormalities. Preliminary studies on small number of patients reported clinical benefits in mild to moderate stage AD patients. However, double blind, placebo controlled studies later did not replicate those initial findings. Interestingly though, in APOE4 carriers and in moderate disease stage subgroups, positive cognitive signals were reported. Nevertheless, both clinical and experimental (mouse) studies show that antibodies in IVIG can accumulate in CNS and its biological activities include neutralization of A\u03b2 oligomers, suppression of neuroinflammation and immunomodulation. Identifying mediators of IVIG's effects at the cellular and molecular level is warranted. In light of its favourable safety profile and aforementioned biological properties, IVIG is still an enigmatic experimental candidate with enormous potential for being an AD therapeutic.",

However, these methods do not work with some genes. Here, we describe an improved AID system (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

To provide examples, we describe the construction of tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and auxin.

Although, protein recovery starts immediately after removal of auxin, it takes multiple generations before equilibrium is reached between protein synthesis and dilution, which is when the original protein levels are restored. Further, we found that blue light, used for GFP excitation, together with auxin results in growth defects, caused by the photo-destruction of auxin to its toxic derivatives, which can be avoided if indole-free auxin substitutes are used. Our work provides guidelines for the successful combination of microscopy, microfluidics and the auxin-inducible degron, offering the yeast community an unprecedented tool for dynamic perturbations on the single cell level.",

However, if the product of the target gene is essential for cell viability, conditional knockout cell lines must be generated. Recently, as gene editing technology using CRISPR/Cas9 has developed, it has become possible to produce conditional knockout cell lines using this technique. However, to obtain final conditional knockout cell lines, it is necessary to perform several experiments with multiple complicated steps. In this paper, we introduce an easy and efficient method to generate conditional knockout cell lines based on combining auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Our method only requires performing a single transfection and is therefore an easy and rapid method to obtain a conditional knockout cell line.",

Other eukaryotes lack the auxin response but share the SCF degradation pathway, allowing us to transplant the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system into nonplant cells and use a small molecule to conditionally control protein stability. The AID system allowed rapid and reversible degradation of target proteins in response to auxin and enabled us to generate efficient conditional mutants of essential proteins in yeast as well as cell lines derived from chicken, mouse, hamster, monkey and human cells, thus offering a powerful tool to control protein expression and study protein function.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21314938": " Inducible inactivation of a protein is a powerful approach for analysis of its function within cells. Fission yeast is a useful model for studying the fundamental mechanisms such as chromosome maintenance and cell cycle. However, previously published strategies for protein-depletion are successful only for some proteins in some specific conditions and still do not achieve efficient depletion to cause acute phenotypes such as immediate cell cycle arrest. The aim of this work was to construct a useful and powerful protein-depletion system in Shizosaccaromyces pombe. We constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, which utilizes auxin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by SCFTIR1 in plants, in fission yeast. Although expression of a plant F-box protein, TIR1, decreased Mcm4-aid, a component of the MCM complex essential for DNA replication tagged with Aux/IAA peptide, depletion did not result in an evident growth defect. We successfully improved degradation efficiency of Mcm4-aid by fusion of TIR1 with fission yeast Skp1, a conserved F-box-interacting component of SCF (improved-AID system; i-AID), and the cells showed severe defect in growth. The i-AID system induced degradation of Mcm4-aid in the chromatin-bound MCM complex as well as those in soluble fractions. The i-AID system in conjunction with transcription repression (off-AID system), we achieved more efficient depletion of other proteins including Pol1 and Cdc45, causing early S phase arrest. Improvement of the AID system allowed us to construct conditional null mutants of S. pombe. We propose that the off-AID system is the powerful method for in vivo protein-depletion in fission yeast.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27010248": "The analysis of consequences resulting after experimental elimination of gene function has been and will continue to be an extremely successful strategy in biological research. Mutational elimination of gene function has been widely used in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. RNA interference is used extensively as well. In the fly, exceptionally precise temporal and spatial control over elimination of gene function can be achieved in combination with sophisticated transgenic approaches and clonal analyses. However, the methods that act at the gene and transcript level cannot eliminate protein products which are already present at the time when mutant cells are generated or RNA interference is started. Targeted inducible protein degradation is therefore of considerable interest for controlled rapid elimination of gene function. To this end, a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting TIR1, a plant F box protein, which can recruit proteins with an auxin-inducible degron to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. Here we demonstrate that the auxin-inducible degradation system functions efficiently also in Drosophila melanogaster. Neither auxin nor TIR1 expression have obvious toxic effects in this organism, and in combination they result in rapid degradation of a target protein fused to the auxin-inducible degron.",

Fractionated porphyrin analysis in erythrasma lesions is yet to be reported. We attempted to investigate erythrasma lesions by isolating the responsible bacteria and determining their exogenous porphyrin production by HPLC analysis. We observed a 78-year-old woman with erythrasma who had a well-demarcated slightly scaling patch on her left foot, between the fourth and fifth toes. Two kinds of colonies on 5 % sheep blood agar were obtained from this lesion. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence revealed the colonies to be Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Microbacterium oxydans. HPLC analysis demonstrated that coproporphyrin III (Copro III) levels were clearly elevated, although the amounts of protoporphyrin were diminished. These results indicate that the fluorescent substance was Copro III.

It is found mostly in occluded intertriginous areas such as the axillae, inframammary areas, interspaces of the toes, intergluteal and crural folds, and is more common in individuals with diabetes mellitus than other clinical patients. This organism can be isolated from a cutaneous site along with a concurrent dermatophyte or Candida albicans infection. The differential diagnosis of erythrasma includes psoriasis, dermatophytosis, candidiasis and intertrigo, and methods for differentiating include Wood's light examination and bacterial and mycological cultures. Erythromycin 250mg four times daily for 14 days is the treatment of choice and other antibacterials include tetracycline and chloramphenicol; however, the use of chloramphenicol is limited by bone marrow suppression potentially leading to neutropenia, agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia. Further studies are needed but clarithromycin may be an additional drug for use in the future. Where there is therapeutic failure or intertriginous involvement, topical solutions such as clindamycin, Whitfield's ointment, sodium fusidate ointment and antibacterial soaps may be required for both treatment and prophylaxis. Limited studies on the efficacy of these medications exist, however, systemic erythromycin demonstrates cure rates as high as 100%. Compared with tetracyclines, systemic erythromycin has greater efficacy in patients with involvement of the axillae and groin, and similar efficacy for interdigital infections. Whitfield's ointment has equal efficacy to systemic erythromycin in the axillae and groin, but shows greater efficacy in the interdigital areas and is comparable with 2% sodium fusidate ointment for treatment of all areas. Adverse drug effects and potential drug interactions need to be considered. No cost-effectiveness data are available but there are limited data on cost-related treatment issues.

The clinical features of SIOD arise from pathological changes in gene expression; however, the underlying mechanism for these gene expression alterations remains unclear.

To test this, we performed a genetic screen for interaction between Marcal1, the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of SMARCAL1, and the genes of the trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG), which encode epigenetic regulators. SMARCAL1 and Marcal1 genetically interacted with trxG and PcG members. A homozygous null mutation of Marcal1 suppressed the wing-to-haltere transformation, ectopic Ultrabithorax (Ubx) expression, and ectopic Ubx minigene expression caused by PcG deficiency.

Through analysis of data from persons with SIOD in 26 unrelated families, we observed that affected individuals from 13 of 23 families with severe disease had two alleles with nonsense, frameshift or splicing mutations, whereas affected individuals from 3 of 3 families with milder disease had a missense mutation on each allele.

It is caused by mutations of SMARCAL1, a gene encoding a putative chromatin remodeling protein of unknown function. Because a detailed description of the clinical features is an essential first step in elucidating the function of SMARCAL1, we present the first detailed anthropometric data for Schimke-immuno-osseous dysplasia patients. By comprehensive anthropometric examination (28 parameters) of 8 patients (3 females) with the typical findings of Schimke-immuno-osseous dysplasia (mean age: 14.8 years; range: 4.9-30.5 years) and 304 patients (117 females) with congenital and hereditary chronic kidney disease (mean age: 10.7 +/- 4.8 years; range: 3-21.8 years), we show that Schimke-immuno-osseous dysplasia patients differ significantly from those with other forms of chronic kidney disease. z scores were calculated with reference limits derived from 5155 healthy children (2591 females) aged 3 to 18 years. The key finding was that, in the latter group, median leg length was significantly more reduced than sitting height, whereas in Schimke-immuno-osseous dysplasia patients, the reduction of sitting height was significantly more pronounced than for leg length. Therefore, the ratio of sitting height/leg length might be a simple tool for the clinician to distinguish Schimke-immuno-osseous dysplasia from other chronic kidney disease patients. Schimke-immuno-osseous dysplasia is very likely if this ratio is &lt; 0.83. However, other forms of chronic kidney disease have to be discussed in case of a ratio &gt; 1.01.",

All dogs presented for generalized seizures and interictal neurological deficits referable to multifocal or diffuse forebrain disease. MRI examinations revealed asymmetrical (2/3) or symmetrical (1/3), bihemispheric intra-axial mass lesions that predominantly affected the frontoparietal lobes that were associated with extensive perilesional edema, and involvement of the corpus callosum. The masses displayed heterogeneous T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensities, variable contrast enhancement (2/3), and mass effect. All tumors demonstrated classical histopathological features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), including glial cell pseudopalisading, serpentine necrosis, microvascular proliferation as well as invasion of the corpus callosum by neoplastic astrocytes.

The patient had undergone parotidectomy 5 years before presentation with this intracranial lesion. On magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion was separate from the pineal gland and displaced the internal cerebral veins downward. Ventricular obstruction and increased cellularity were also suggested, and multiple fluid-filled cystic spaces were observed. The tumor was partially resected, because the extreme lateral boundary could not be visualized. Histological analysis with anti-c-kit antibody showed strong expression of the epithelial component; immunohistochemistry with anti-p63 antibody revealed nests of positive tumor cells, highlighting the myoepithelial component. The tumor also stained positive for anti-Myb antibody. The treatment for this lesion is surgical debulking followed by radiation therapy; however, the overall prognosis remains grim because of limited chemotherapy options and a propensity for recurrence in both local and distant fashions. When a tumor with adenoid histological features and a \"butterfly\" phenotype grows in the corpus callosum in a patient with known parotid ACC, both metastasis and adenoid variant GBM should be considered.

Here, we aimed to produce induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines that can be used to improve our understanding of aneuploid syndromes.

To gain a more global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma we conducted an array-based analysis. Our data demonstrated tumors to segregate according to their location in the CNS, which was associated with a difference in the global level of methylation. Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'CpG island methylator phenotype' (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. This hypermethylated profile was associated with an increase in expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in methylating DNA, suggesting an underlying mechanism. An integrated analysis of methylation and mRNA expression array data allowed us to identify methylation-induced expression changes. Most notably genes involved in the control of cell growth and death and the immune system were identified, including members of the JNK pathway and PPARG. In conclusion, we have generated a global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28985562": "The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called \"contact domains,\" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves. \"Loop domains\" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome. \"Compartment domains\" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate. Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop. Although re-formation rates vary greatly, many megabase-sized loops recovered in under an hour, consistent with a model where loop extrusion is rapid.",

Current management by glucocorticoids has unclear molecular benefits and harsh side effects. It is uncertain whether therapies that avoid hormonal stunting of growth and development, and/or immunosuppression, would be more or less beneficial. Here, we discover an oral drug with mechanisms that provide efficacy through anti-inflammatory signaling and membrane-stabilizing pathways, independent of hormonal or immunosuppressive effects. We find VBP15 protects and promotes efficient repair of skeletal muscle cells upon laser injury, in opposition to prednisolone. Potent inhibition of NF-\u03baB is mediated through protein interactions of the glucocorticoid receptor, however VBP15 shows significantly reduced hormonal receptor transcriptional activity. The translation of these drug mechanisms into DMD model mice improves muscle strength, live-imaging and pathology through both preventive and post-onset intervention regimens. These data demonstrate successful improvement of dystrophy independent of hormonal, growth, or immunosuppressive effects, indicating VBP15 merits clinical investigation for DMD and would benefit other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

Rapid onset of action was observed for most efficacy end points. Dose-dependent increases in haemoglobin were observed. The percentage of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was similar in the placebo and filgotinib groups (\u223c40%). Eight patients on filgotinib and one on placebo had a serious TEAE, and four patients, all of whom received filgotinib, experienced a serious infection. No tuberculosis or opportunistic infections were reported. Over 24 weeks, filgotinib as monotherapy was efficacious in treating the signs and symptoms of active RA, with a rapid onset of action.

However, the use of random barcodes requires additional preprocessing of the mapping data, which complicates the computational analysis. To date, only a very limited number of software packages are available for the analysis of ChIP-exo data, which have not yet been systematically tested and compared on ChIP-nexus data. Here, we present a comprehensive software package for ChIP-nexus data that exploits the random barcodes for selective removal of PCR duplicates and for quality control. Furthermore, we developed bespoke methods to estimate the width of the protected region resulting from protein-DNA binding and to infer binding positions from ChIP-nexus data. Finally, we applied our peak calling method as well as the two other methods MACE and MACS2 to the available ChIP-nexus data. The Q-nexus software is efficient and easy to use. Novel statistics about duplication rates in consideration of random barcodes are calculated. Our method for the estimation of the width of the protected region yields unbiased signatures that are highly reproducible for biological replicates and at the same time very specific for the respective factors analyzed. As judged by the irreproducible discovery rate (IDR), our peak calling algorithm shows a substantially better reproducibility.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23113023": " Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is an inherited form of bilateral optic atrophy leading to the loss of central vision. The primary cause of vision loss is mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, unknown secondary genetic and/or epigenetic risk factors are suggested to influence its neuropathology. In this study folate gene polymorphisms were examined as a possible LHON secondary genetic risk factor in Iranian patients. Common polymorphisms in the MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) and MTRR (A66G) genes were tested in 21 LHON patients and 150 normal controls. Strong associations were observed between the LHON syndrome and C677T (P= 0.00) and A66G (P= 0.00) polymorphisms. However, no significant association was found between A1298C (P =0.69) and the LHON syndrome. This is the first study that shows MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G polymorphisms play a role in the etiology of the LHON syndrome. This finding may help in the better understanding of mechanisms involved in neural degeneration and vision loss by LHON and hence the better treatment of patients.",

Although molecular and histological diagnoses have been established, imaging modalities for the functioning evaluation of these patients are still obscure. In this study, we tried to use 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT images to analyze various mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. We examined 99mTc-HMPAO Brain SPECT studies of 15 patients with various types of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (3 Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), 4 Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), 4 mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), 3 myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber disease (MERRF), and 1 Leigh syndrome), diagnosed by molecular studies. The results of our studies show obviously decreased radiotracer accumulation in the parieto-temporal regions after stroke-like episodes in patients with MELAS and MERRF: Relatively diminished brain perfusion in patients with KSS is noted, probably secondary to severe encephalomyopathy or subdural effusion. However, there seems to be no significant correlation between the clinical manifestations and the imaging findings in LHON and Leigh. 99mTc-HMPAO Brain SPECT is useful in the diagnosing and assessment of the progress of MERRF, MELAS and KSS.

An 11-year-old Chinese girl presented with sudden onset of bilateral blurred vision. The clinical history, imaging studies, and molecular analysis results were reviewed. The PubMed and OVID databases were used for literature review. Nonischemic CRVO in the subject's right eye and tortuosity of small and medium-sized retinal arterioles in the left eye were found at initial presentation. Bilateral optic disc pallor was then noted with recovery of CRVO. Severe headache and several stroke-like episodes occurred subsequently, with elevated lactate levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome was diagnosed, and mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed G13513A heteroplasmic mutation. Vision was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/800 in the left eye at the last visit. Mitochondrial DNA G13513A mutation can cause LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. Nonischemic CRVO is a rare manifestation of LHON/MELAS. Atypical findings in cases of LHON should raise the suspicion of overlap syndrome or other mitochondrial diseases.",

Furthermore, some pecularities such as mitochondria's high polymorphism, the existence of mitochondrial pseudogenes, and the various considerations to take into account when studying mitochondrial diseases will also be mentioned. Mitochondrial syndromes mostly affecting the nervous system have, during the past few years, been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) alterations such as deletions, duplications, mutations and depletions. We suggest a possible classification of mitochondrial diseases according to the kind of mt DNA mutations: structural mitochondrial gene mutation as in LHON (Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy) and NARP (Neurogenic muscle weakness, Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa) as well as some cases of Leigh's syndrome; transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA mitochondrial gene mutation as in MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Strokelike Episodes) or MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers) or deafness with aminoglycoside; structural with transfer RNA mitochondrial gene mutations as observed in large-scale deletions or duplications in Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson's syndrome, diabetes mellitus with deafness, and CPEO (Chronic Progressive External Ophtalmoplegia). Depletions of the mt DNA may also be classified in this category. Even though mutations are generally maternally inherited, most of the deletions are sporadic. However, multiple deletions or depletions may be transmitted in a mendelan trait which suggests that nuclear gene products play a primary role in these processes. The relationship between a mutation and a particular phenotype is far from being fully understood. Gene dosage and energic threshold, which are tissue-specific, appear to be the best indicators. However, the recessive or dominant behavior of both the wild type or the mutated genome appears to play a significant role, which can be verified with in vitro studies.",

All three primary LHON mutations occurring in the European and North American populations have been found to be associated with an MS-like syndrome. The neurological characteristics of MS associated with LHON are indistinguishable from those of MS in general, but the severe and bilateral visual symptoms and signs justify considering these patients as a clinical subgroup of MS and screening them for LHON mutations.

The observed discordance between state-of-the-art VC pipelines, however, indicates that the current practice still suffers from non-negligible numbers of false positive and negative SNV and INDEL calls that were shown to be enriched among discordant calls but also in genomic regions with low sequence complexity. Here, we describe our method ReliableGenome (RG) for partitioning genomes into high and low concordance regions with respect to a set of surveyed VC pipelines. Our method combines call sets derived by multiple pipelines from arbitrary numbers of datasets and interpolates expected concordance for genomic regions without data. By applying RG to 219 deep human WGS datasets, we demonstrate that VC concordance depends predominantly on genomic context rather than the actual sequencing data which manifests in high recurrence of regions that can/cannot be reliably genotyped by a single method. This enables the application of pre-computed regions to other data created with comparable sequencing technology and software. RG outperforms comparable efforts in predicting VC concordance and false positive calls in low-concordance regions which underlines its usefulness for variant filtering, annotation and prioritization. RG allows focusing resource-intensive algorithms (e.g. consensus calling methods) on the smaller, discordant share of the genome (20-30%) which might result in increased overall accuracy at reasonable costs. Our method and analysis of discordant calls may further be useful for development, benchmarking and optimization of VC algorithms and for the relative comparison of call sets between different studies/pipelines.

However, TAB2 alone is dispensable for NF-\u03baB activation in embryonic fibroblasts, and the functional roles of TAB2 and TAB3 in immune cells has yet to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that TAB2 and TAB3 are essential for B cell activation leading to Ag-specific Ab responses, as well as B-1 and marginal zone B cell development. TAB2 and TAB3 are critical for the activation of MAPKs, especially ERK, but not NF-\u03baB, in response to TLR and CD40 stimulation in B cells. Surprisingly, TAB2 and TAB3 are dispensable for TAK1 activation in B cells, indicating that TAB2 and TAB3 activate MAPKs via a pathway independent of TAK1. In contrast to B cells, macrophages lacking TAB2 and TAB3 did not show any defects in the cytokine production and the signaling pathway in response to TLR stimulation. Furthermore, TAB2 and TAB3 were dispensable for TNF-induced cytokine production in embryonic fibroblasts.

Other polyubiquitin binding proteins can antagonize this pathway by competing with NEMO for polyubiquitin. We have used protein arrays to identify polyubiquitin binding proteins that regulate NF-kappaB activity. Using polyubiquitin as bait, protein arrays were screened and polyubiquitin binders identified. Novel polyubiquitin binders AWP1, CALCOCO2, N4BP1, RIO3, TEX27, TTC3, UBFD1 and ZNF313 were identified using this approach, while known NF-kappaB regulators including NEMO, A20, ABIN-1, ABIN-2, optineurin and p62 were also identified. Overexpressed AWP1 and RIO3 repressed NF-kappaB activity in a manner similar to optineurin, while siRNAs directed against AWP1 and RIO3 also reduced NF-kappaB activity. TNFalpha-dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha was also suppressed by overexpression of AWP1 and RIO3, possibly due to the polyubiquitin binding activity of these proteins.

However, the role of the UIMs in USP25 remains unclear. Here we show that the tandem UIM region binds to Lys48-, but not Lys63-, linked ubiquitin chains, where the two UIMs played a critical and cooperative role. Purified USP25 exhibited higher ubiquitin isopeptidase activity to Lys48-, than to Lys63-, linked ubiquitin chains. Mutations that disrupted the ubiquitin-binding ability of the tandem UIMs resulted in a reduced ubiquitin isopeptidase activity of USP25, suggesting a role for the UIMs in exerting the full catalytic activity of USP25. Moreover, when mutations that convert the binding preference from Lys48- to Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains were introduced into the tandem UIM region, the USP25 mutants acquired elevated and reduced isopeptidase activity toward Lys63- and Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains, respectively. These results suggested that the binding preference of the tandem UIMs toward Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains contributes not only to the full catalytic activity but also to the ubiquitin chain substrate preference of USP25, possibly by selectively holding the Lys48-linked ubiquitin chain substrates in the proximity of the catalytic core.",

The interactome is regulated by PARP1 and its co-factor CTCF. They not only mediate chromatin fiber interactions but also promote the recruitment of circadian genes to the lamina. Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation. Furthermore, depletion of H3K9me2/3, inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib, or downregulation of PARP1 or CTCF expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription.

GFP-tagged ROF1 under the control of a 35S promoter was localised in the cytoplasm and the cell periphery of Nicotiana tabacum leaf explants. Immunofluorescence microscopy of Arabidopsis thaliana root tips verified its cytoplasmic localization and membrane association and showed ROF1 localization in the elongation zone which was expanded to the meristematic zone in plants grown on high salt media. Endogenous ROF1 was shown to accumulate in response to high salt treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana young leaves as well as in seedlings germinated on high salt media (0.15 and 0.2 M NaCl) at both an mRNA and protein level. Plants over-expressing ROF1, (WSROF1OE), exhibited enhanced germination under salinity stress which was significantly reduced in the rof1(-) knock out mutants and abolished in the double mutants of ROF1 and of its interacting homologue ROF2 (WSrof1(-)/2(-)).

Exposure to heat stress induces nuclear localization of the ROF1-HSP90.1 complex, which is dependent upon the presence of the transcription factor HsfA2, which interacts with HSP90.1 but not with ROF1. Nuclear localization of ROF1 was not detected in Arabidopsis HSP90.1 and HsfA2 knockout mutants.

Transgenic ROF1 over-expressors showed better survival in response to exposure to 45 degrees C than wild-type plants did. In rof1 knockout mutants, the level of expression of small HSPs regulated by HsfA2 was dramatically reduced after exposure to 37 degrees C and recovery for 24-48 h, and correlates well with the mutant phenotype.

The abundance of the combined pool of free and reversibly bound MDA did not change dramatically in stress, although a significant increase in the free MDA pool under oxidative conditions was observed. The half-life of infiltrated MDA indicated rapid metabolic turnover/sequestration. Exposure of plants to low levels of MDA using a recently developed protocol powerfully upregulated many genes on a cDNA microarray with a bias towards those implicated in abiotic/environmental stress (e.g. ROF1 and XERO2). Remarkably, and in contrast to the activities of other reactive electrophile species (i.e. small vinyl ketones), none of the pathogenesis-related (PR) genes tested responded to MDA. The use of structural mimics of MDA isomers suggested that the propensity of the molecule to act as a cross-linking/modifying reagent might contribute to the activation of gene expression.

ROF1/ROF2 proteins accumulate at 37 degrees C, remain stable for at least 4 h upon recovery at 22 degrees C, whereas, their mRNA level is reduced after 1 h at 22 degrees C. By protein interaction assays, it was demonstrated, that ROF1 is a novel partner of HSP90. The five amino acids identified as essential for recognition and interaction between the mammalian chaperones and HSP90 are conserved in the plant ROF1-HSP90. We suggest that ROF/HSP90 complexes assemble in vivo. We propose that specific complexes formation between an HSP90 and ROF isoforms depends on their spatial and temporal expression. Such complexes might be regulated by environmental conditions such as heat stress or internal cues such as different hormones.",

The deduced amino acid sequence of ROF1 predicts a 551-amino acid, 62 kDa polypeptide which is 44% identical to human FKBP59 - a 59 kDa FKBP which binds to the 90 kDa heat shock protein and is associated with inactive steroid hormone receptors. ROF1 contains three FKBP12-like domains in the N-terminal portion of the protein (in contrast to two domains in mammalian FKBP59), an internal repeat structure associated with protein-protein interactions (tetratricopeptide repeats), and a putative calmodulin binding domain near the C-terminal region of the protein. No sequences associated with protein translocation out of the cytosol were found in ROF1. ROF1 mRNA was found at equivalent low levels in light-grown roots, stems, and flowers and at slightly higher levels in leaves. The abundance of ROF1 mRNA increased several-fold under stress conditions such as wounding or exposure to elevated NaCl levels.",

Recent reports have suggested that CTCF binding is more dynamic during development than previously appreciated. Here, we set out to understand the extent to which shifts in genome-wide CTCF occupancy contribute to the 3D reconfiguration of fine-scale chromatin folding during early neural lineage commitment. Unexpectedly, we observe a sharp decrease in CTCF occupancy during the transition from na\u00efve/primed pluripotency to multipotent primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Many pluripotency gene-enhancer interactions are anchored by CTCF, and its occupancy is lost in parallel with loop decommissioning during differentiation. Conversely, CTCF binding sites in NPCs are largely preexisting in pluripotent stem cells. Only a small number of CTCF sites arise de novo in NPCs. We identify another zinc finger protein, Yin Yang 1 (YY1), at the base of looping interactions between NPC-specific genes and enhancers. Putative NPC-specific enhancers exhibit strong YY1 signal when engaged in 3D contacts and negligible YY1 signal when not in loops. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of <i>Yy1</i> specifically disrupts interactions between key NPC enhancers and their target genes. YY1-mediated interactions between NPC regulatory elements are often nested within constitutive loops anchored by CTCF. Together, our results support a model in which YY1 acts as an architectural protein to connect developmentally regulated looping interactions; the location of YY1-mediated interactions may be demarcated in development by a preexisting topological framework created by constitutive CTCF-mediated interactions.",

In this study, we assayed the 3D genomic contact profiles of a large number of CTCF binding sites with high-resolution 4C-seq. As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. To directly test this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to delete core CTCF binding sites in three loci, including the CTCF site in the Sox2 super-enhancer. In all instances, CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost, and chromatin loops with distal, convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops. We conclude that CTCF binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation of higher-order chromatin structure.",

Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and \u03b2-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences.",

We identify \u223c10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF.

Here, we combine these maps with new Hi-C, microscopy, and genome-editing experiments to study the physical structure of chromatin fibers, domains, and loops. We find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer. Combining Hi-C data and novel mathematical theorems, we show that contact domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule. Instead, we use physical simulations to study two models of genome folding. In one, intermonomer attraction during polymer condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic \"tension globule.\" In the other, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase. Both models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with the observation that contact domains tend to form inside loops. However, the extrusion model explains a far wider array of observations, such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the CTCF-binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the convergent orientation. Finally, we perform 13 genome-editing experiments examining the effect of altering CTCF-binding sites on chromatin folding. The convergent rule correctly predicts the affected loops in every case. Moreover, the extrusion model accurately predicts in silico the 3D maps resulting from each experiment using only the location of CTCF-binding sites in the WT. Thus, we show that it is possible to disrupt, restore, and move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a single base pair.",

We have assessed the effects of NAP (davunetide), an eight-amino acid peptide that decreases tau hyperphosphorylation, in mice overexpressing wild-type human \u03b1-synuclein (Thy1-aSyn mice), a model that recapitulates aspects of PD. We found that the p-tau/tau level increased in a subcortical tissue block that includes the striatum and brain stem, and in the cerebellum of the Thy1-aSyn mice compared to nontransgenic controls. Intermittent intranasal NAP administration at 2 \u03bcg/mouse per day, 5 days a week, for 24 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age, significantly decreased the ratio of p-tau/tau levels in the subcortical region while a higher dose of 15 \u03bcg/mouse per day induced a decrease in p-tau/tau levels in the cerebellum. Both NAP doses reduced hyperactivity, improved habituation to a novel environment, and reduced olfactory deficits in the Thy1-aSyn mice, but neither dose improved the severe deficits of motor coordination observed on the challenging beam and pole, contrasting with previous data obtained with continuous daily administration of the drug.

Put3 binds to GRS I and is required for both GRS I-dependent positioning at the nuclear periphery and interchromosomal clustering of GRS I-targeted genes.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17223284": "At certain evolutionary junctures, two or more mutations participating in the build-up of a new complex function may be required to become available simultaneously in the same individuals. How could this happen in higher organisms whose populations are small compared to those of microbes, and in which chances of combined nearly simultaneous highly specific favorable mutations are correspondingly low? The question can in principle be answered for regulatory evolution, one of the basic processes of evolutionary change. A combined resetting of transcription rates in several genes could occur in the same individual. It is proposed that, in eukaryotes, changes in epigenetic trends and epigenetically transforming encounters between alternative chromatin structures could arise frequently enough so as to render probable particular conjunctions of changed transcription rates. Such conjunctions could involve mutational changes with low specificity requirements in gene-associated regions of non-protein-coding sequences. The effects of such mutations, notably when they determine the use of histone variants and covalent modifications of histones, can be among those that migrate along chromatin. Changes in chromatin structure are often cellularly inheritable over at least a limited number of generations of cells, and of individuals when the germ line is involved. SINEs and LINEs, which have been considered \"junk DNA\", are among the repeat sequences that would appear liable to have teleregulatory effects on the function of a nearby promoter, through changes in their numbers and distribution. There may also be present preexisting unstably inheritable epigenetic trends leading to cellular variegation, trends endemic in a cell population based on DNA sequences previously established in the neighborhood. Either way, epigenetically conditioned teleregulatory trends may display only limited penetrance. The imposition at a distance of new chromatin structures with regulatory impact can occur in cis as well as in trans, and is examined as intrachromosomally spreading teleregulation and interchromosomal \"gene kissing\". The chances for two or more particular epigenetically determined regulatory trends to occur together in a cell are increased thanks to the proposed low specificity requirements for most of the pertinent sequence changes in intergenic and intronic DNA or in the distribution of middle repetitive sequences that have teleregulatory impact. Inheritable epigenetic changes (\"epimutations\") with effects at a distance would then perdure over the number of generations required for \"assimilation\" of the several regulatory novelties through the occurrence and selection, gene by gene, of specific classical mutations. These mutations would have effects similar to the epigenetic effects, yet would provide stability and penetrance. The described epigenetic/genetic partnership may well at times have opened the way toward certain complex new functions. Thus, the presence of \"junk DNA\", through co-determining the (higher or lower) order and the variants of chromatin structure with regulatory effects at a distance, might make an important contribution to the evolution of complex organisms.",

In order to test the hypothesis that the Hox loci might cluster in nuclear space in order to share regulatory components, we performed 3D FISH on cryosections of developing mouse embryos and differentiating embryoid bodies. We did not observe any instances of co-localization of 4 different Hox alleles. Instances of 2 different alleles touching each other were found in 20-47% of nuclei depending on the tissue. The frequency of such \"kissing\" events was not significantly different in cells expressing a high proportion of the Hox clusters when compared to cells expressing none or only a few Hox genes. We found that the HoxB and HoxC clusters, which are located in gene-rich regions, were involved more frequently in gene kissing in embryonic nuclei. In the case of HoxB, this observation correlated with the positioning of the corresponding chromosome towards the interior of the nucleus. Our results indicate that co-regulation of the different Hox clusters is not associated with co-localization of the loci at a single regulatory compartment and that the chromosomal context may influence the extent to which they contact each other in the nucleus.",

Patients typically present with kidney impairment and progress to end-stage renal disease over a median time of 4.6 years. Six patients presented with proteinuria, hypertension, and/or lower limb edema and underwent detailed clinical and laboratory investigations. A novel <i>FGA</i> gene mutation was identified in each case: 2 frameshift mutations F521Sfs*27 and G519Efs*30 and 4 single base substitutions G555F, E526K, E524K, R554H. In 5 subjects, extensive amyloid deposits were found solely within the glomeruli, which stained specifically with antibodies to fibrinogen A alpha chain, and in one of these cases, we found coexistent fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease. One patient was diagnosed with light-chain amyloidosis after a bone marrow examination revealed a small clonal plasma cell population, and laser microdissection of the amyloid deposits followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry identified kappa light chain as the fibril protein. We report 6 novel mutations in the <i>FGA</i> gene: 5 were associated with renal fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and 1 was found to be incidental to light-chain amyloid deposits discovered in a patient with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Clinical awareness and suspicion of hereditary amyloidosis corroborated by genetic analysis and adequate typing using combined immunohistochemistry and laser microdissection and mass spectrometry is valuable to avoid misdiagnosis, especially when a family history of amyloidosis is absent.",

Differential diagnosis is complicated, but is relevant for prognosis and treatment. We describe a patient with nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal failure, who had a mother with renal amiloidosis. Renal biopsy revealed amyloid deposits in glomerular space, with absence of light chains and protein AA. We suspected amyloidosis with fibrinogen A alpha chain deposits, which is the most frequent cause of hereditary amyloidosis in Europe, with a glomerular preferential affectation. However, the genetic study showed a novel mutation in apolipoprotein AI. On reviewing the biopsy of the patient's mother similar glomerular deposits were found, but there were significant deposits in the renal medulla as well, which is typical in APO AI amyloidosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Apo AI amyloidosis is characterized by slowly progressive renal disease and end-stage renal disease occurs aproximately 3 to 15 years from initial diagnosis. Renal transplantation offers an acceptable graft survival and in these patients with hepatorenal involvement simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation could be considered.",

Direct genomic DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated that all three affected individuals had the guanine to thymine 4993 transversion.

In this kindred, renal disease appeared early in life and led to terminal renal failure at an early age. Renal transplantation resulted in rapid destruction of the allograft by amyloid deposition within 2 years. Amyloid fibril protein isolated from a transplanted kidney was found to contain a novel, hybrid peptide of 49 residues whose N-terminal 23 amino acids were identical to residues 499 to 521 of normal fibrinogen Aalpha-chain. The remainder of the peptide (26 residues) represented a completely new sequence for mammalian proteins. DNA sequencing documented that the new sequence was the result of a single nucleotide deletion at position 4897 of the fibrinogen Aalpha-chain gene that gives a frame-shift at codon 522 and premature termination at codon 548. The contributions toward fibrillogenesis of the two portions of the amyloid fibril protein, ie, N-terminal fibrinogen sequence and C-terminal novel sequence, are presently unknown. However, the early onset and rapid reoccurrence of amyloid in renal transplants is unlike the clinical course with other amyloid proteins having single amino acid substitutions that give hereditary renal amyloidosis. Liver transplantation to stop synthesis of this abnormal hepatic derived protein should be considered early in the course of the disease.",

Both of these kindreds are American of Irish descent presenting with non-neuropathic, nephropathic amyloidosis in the fifth to the seventh decade of life. DNA sequencing showed a point mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene that is responsible for substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 526.

Because of the risk of recurrence of amyloidosis on its transplant, we carried out a combined transplantation liver-kidney despite the absence of clinical or biological hepatic abnormalities. Four years later, the result is excellent and there is no sign of the disease on the new organs.

Immunohistochemical studies revealed AFib amyloidosis and genetic studies the amino acid exchange Glu526Val of the fibrinogen Aalpha-chain mutation, which was also present in one of her sons. The mutant gene in this patient was associated with the same haplotype as all other reported cases of Glu526Val mutations. This is the first reported AFibamyloidosis in Portugal, and the first case of AFib in which sensory and autonomic nerve fiber dysfunction is described, indicating that small nerve fiber lesion can occur in the fibrinogen Aalpha chain mutation.

Previous reports of fibrinogen A alpha-chain amyloidosis have been in isolated kindreds, usually in the context of a novel amyloidogenic mutation. Here, we describe 71 patients with fibrinogen amyloidosis, who were prospectively studied at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre. Median age at presentation was 58 yr, and renal involvement led to diagnosis in all cases. Even after a median follow-up of 4 yr, clinically significant extra-renal disease was rare. Renal histology was characteristic: striking glomerular enlargement with almost complete obliteration of the normal architecture by amyloid deposition and little or no vascular or interstitial amyloid. We discovered four amyloidogenic mutations in fibrinogen (P552H, E540V, T538K, and T525fs). A family history of renal disease was frequently absent. Median time from presentation to ESRD was 4.6 yr, and the estimated median patient survival from presentation was 15.2 yr. Among 44 patients who reached ESRD, median survival was 9.3 yr. Twelve renal transplants survived for a median of 6.0 (0-12.2) yr. Seven grafts had failed after median follow up from transplantation of 5.8 yr, including three from recurrent amyloid after 5.8, 6.0, and 7.4 yr; three grafts failed immediately for surgical reasons and one failed from transplant glomerulopathy after 5.8 yr with no histological evidence of amyloid. At censor, the longest surviving graft was 12.2 yr. In summary, fibrinogen amyloidosis is predominantly a renal disease characterized by variable penetrance, distinctive histological appearance, proteinuria, and progressive renal impairment. Survival is markedly better than observed with systemic AL amyloidosis, and outcomes with renal replacement therapy are comparable to those for age-matched individuals with nondiabetic renal disease.",

We report on 101 members of a family after having conducted patient interviews, chart review, genetic testing, renal biopsies and assessment for extrarenal amyloid deposition. Ten family members had chronic kidney disease with late-onset gross proteinuria and a variable course of declining renal function, starting in the fourth decade of life. In two affected living members, we identified the AFib R554L mutation. Renal biopsies from two affected members revealed almost complete obliteration of the mesangial glomerular architecture, although kidney function was only moderately impaired. There was neither evidence of extrarenal amyloidosis nor accelerated atherosclerosis. Renal amyloidosis associated with the R554L AFib variant dominated the clinical picture in this family, which was similar to that associated with the much more prevalent E526V mutation.

Retrospective study of 97 patients with DMD aged 10 to &lt;16 years treated with daily glucocorticoid (89% on deflazacort) for a mean of 8.5 years. Outcome measures were motor, pulmonary, and cardiac function, and scoliosis. Side effects were growth failure and weight gain, facial fullness, blood pressure, bone health, cataracts, gastrointestinal symptoms, behavior, hypertrichosis, and need for medication interventions. For 13- to 16-year-old patients, 40% could rise from the floor and 50% could perform the 30-foot run test. Forced vital capacity for the entire cohort was well preserved. Thirteen percent of younger (10- to &lt;13-year-old) and 21% of older patients had findings of left ventricle systolic dysfunction. Six percent (all aged 16 years) developed scoliosis (Cobb angle &gt;20 degrees).

We therefore sought to identify novel mutations to better understand chordoma biology and to potentially identify therapeutic targets. Given the relatively high costs of whole genome sequencing, we performed a focused genetic analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (Sequenom iPLEX genotyping). We tested 865 hotspot mutations in 111 oncogenes and selected tumor suppressor genes (OncoMap v. 3.0) of 45 human chordoma tumor samples. Of the analyzed samples, seven were identified with at least one mutation. Six of these were from fresh frozen samples, and one was from a paraffin embedded sample. These observations were validated using an independent platform using homogeneous mass extend MALDI-TOF (Sequenom hME Genotyping). These genetic alterations include: ALK (A877S), CTNNB1 (T41A), NRAS (Q61R), PIK3CA (E545K), PTEN (R130), CDKN2A (R58*), and SMARCB1 (R40*). This study reports on the largest comprehensive mutational analysis of chordomas performed to date. To focus on mutations that have the greatest chance of clinical relevance, we tested only oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that have been previously implicated in the tumorigenesis of more common malignancies. We identified rare genetic changes that may have functional significance to the underlying biology and potential therapeutics for chordomas. Mutations in CDKN2A and PTEN occurred in areas of chromosomal copy loss. When this data is paired with the studies showing 18 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at the locus for CDKN2A, 17 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at PTEN, and 3 of 4 chordoma samples displaying deletion at the SMARCB1 locus, we can infer that a loss of heterozygosity at these three loci may play a significant role in chordoma pathogenesis.",

Cases of chordoma in pediatric age are often poorly differentiated, showing cytologic atypia, increased cellularity, and mitosis, and their aggressive behavior is associated with a high incidence of metastatic spread and a short patient survival. Recent studies have described loss of SMARCB1/INI1 protein in poorly differentiated chordomas associated not with point mutations but with SMARCB1/INI1 gene deletions instead. In this study, we considered immunohistochemistry and SMARCB1/INI1 mutational status to examine SMARCB1 status in a series of pediatric chordomas (7 classic and 1 poorly differentiated). We performed immunohistochemical tests for INI1, brachyury, S100, and cytokeratins and conducted a genetic analysis on the SMARCB1 coding sequence (NM_003073) using the Sanger method and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect abnormal copy numbers of the gene locus. All 8 cases were positive for brachyury, whereas there was no nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases, including the poorly differentiated chordoma. Genetic analysis identified a missense mutation in 2 cases and a nonsense mutation associated with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 protein and features of poorly differentiated tumor in 1. These mutations were novel variants occurring in heterozygosity, and they were judged to be pathogenic by 3 different bioinformatic tools. In 7 of 8 cases we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and 3 cases showed deletions at the SMARCB1 locus. Our results confirm the pathogenic involvement of SMARCB1/INI1 in childhood chordoma. We also describe 3 novel pathogenic mutations.",

The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC). Moreover, late cases occurring in adults are now increasingly reported, raising the question of differential diagnoses and emphasizing nosological issues. To address this issue, we have analyzed the expression profiles of a training set of 32 SMARCB1-deficient tumors (SDT), with ascertained diagnosis of RT (n = 16, all &lt; 5 years of age), ES (n = 8, all &gt; 10 years of age), UC (n = 3) and RMC (n = 5). As compared with other SDT, RT are characterized by an embryonic signature, and up-regulation of key-actors of de novo DNA methylation processes. Using this signature, we then analysed the expression profiling of 37 SDT to infer the appropriate diagnosis. Thirteen adult onset tumors showed strong similarity with pediatric RT, in spite of older age; by exome sequencing, these tumors also showed genomic features indistinguishable from pediatric RT. In contrary, 8 tumors were reclassified within carcinoma, ES or UC categories, while the remaining could not be related to any of those entities. Our results demonstrate that embryonic signature is shared by all RT, whatever the age at diagnosis; they also illustrate that many adult-onset SDT of ambiguous histological diagnosis are clearly different from RT. Finally, our study paves the way for the routine use of expression-based signatures to give accurate diagnosis of SDT.",

We examined 5 reported/target predicted miRNAs to SMARCB1/INI1 in SMARCB1/INI1 immunonegative and immunopositive cases, and found upregulation of miR-671-5p and miR-193a-5p in SMARCB1/INI1-immunonegative cases. Notably, these two miRNAs were significantly predicted to target TGF-\u03b2 signaling, suggestive of dysregulation of developmental and osteoblast regulation pathway in CCs.

So far, around 20 cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression have been reported. Here, we report two cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, which is very rare among the pediatric chordoma types. Both patients presented clival masses on preoperative MRI. Histologically, both tumors had nonclassic histologic features for conventional chordoma: sheets of large epithelioid to spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Both cases revealed nuclear expression of brachyury, loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and lack of embryonal, neuroectodermal, or epithelial component. One case showed heterozygous loss of EWSR1 gene by break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization that reflected loss of SMARCB1/INI1 gene.

The aim was to elucidate the relative locations of the telocentric chromosomes within the cell. The data obtained strongly suggest that all four telocentrics of chromosome 1 B or 6 B are spacially and simultaneously co-associated. In plants carrying two complementary (6 B (S) and 6 B (L)) and a non-related (5 B (L)) telocentric, only the complementary chromosomes were found to be somatically associated. It is thought, therefore, that the somatic association of chromosomes may involve more than two chromosomes in the same association and, since complementary telocentrics are as much associated as homologous, that the homology between centromeres (probably the only homologous region that exists between complementary telocentrics) is a very important condition for somatic association of chromosomes. The spacial arrangement of chromosomes was studied at anaphase and prophase and the polar orientation of chromosomes at prophase was found to resemble anaphase orientation. This was taken as good evidence for the maintenance of the chromosome arrangement - the Rabl orientation - and of the peripheral location of the centromere and its association with the nuclear membrane. Within this general arrangement homologous telocentric chromosomes were frequently seen to have their centromeres associated or directed towards each other. The role of the centromere in somatic association as a spindle fibre attachment and chromosome binder is discussed. It is suggested that for non-homologous chromosomes to become associated in root tips, the only requirement needed should be the homology of centromeres such as exists between complementary telocentrics, or, as a possible alternative, common repeated sequences of DNA molecules around the centromere region.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219911": "Specific chromosome domains in interphase nuclei of neurons and glia were studied by three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of serial optical sections from in situ hybridized human CNS tissue. Overall patterns of centromere organization, delineated with alphoid repeats, were comparable to those seen in mouse, and are clearly conserved in mammalian evolution. Cloned probes from other individual chromosome domains were used to define interphase organization more precisely. Homologous chromosomes were spatially separated in nuclei. In large neurons, probes specific for 9q12, or 1q12 showed that at least one homolog was always compartmentalized together with centromeres on the nucleolus, while the second signal either abutted the nucleolus or was on the nuclear membrane. A telomeric Yq12 sequence also localized together with perinucleolar centromeres in a completely non-Rabl orientation. In astrocytes, these three chromosome regions were on the membrane and not necessarily associated with nucleoli. Therefore there are different patterns of interphase chromosome organization in functionally distinct cell types. In contrast to the above domains, a 1p36.3 telomeric sequence embedded in a large Alu-rich and early replicating chromosome region, was always found in an interior euchromatic nuclear compartment in both neurons and glial cells. In double hybridizations with 1q12 and 1p36.3 probes, 1p arms were clearly separated in all cells, and arms projected radially into the interior nucleoplasm with non-Rabl orientations. There was no absolute or rigid position for each 1p arm with respect to each other or to the major dendrite, indicating that individual chromosome arms may be dynamically positioned even in highly differentiated cell types. We suggest that centromeric and other highly repeated non-transcribed sequence domains may act as general organizing centers for cell type specific interphase patterns that are conserved in mammalian evolution. Such centers would allow selected groups of chromosome arms to extend into (and contract from) an interior, presumably transcriptionally active, nuclear compartment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10806101": "During interphase in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeres are clustered near one pole of the nucleus as a rosette with the spindle pole body at its hub. Opposite to the centromeric pole is the nucleolus. Chromosome arms extend outwards from the centromeric pole and are preferentially directed towards the opposite pole. Centromere clustering is reduced by the ndc10 mutation, which affects a kinetochore protein, and by the microtubule poison nocodazole. This suggests that clustering is actively maintained or enforced by the association of centromeres with microtubules throughout interphase. Unlike the Rabl-orientation known from many higher eukaryotes, centromere clustering in yeast is not only a relic of anaphase chromosome polarization, because it can be reconstituted without the passage of cells through anaphase. Within the rosette, homologous centromeres are not arranged in a particular order that would suggest somatic pairing or genome separation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11559751": "Chromosomes are not packed randomly in the nucleus. The Rabl orientation is an example of the non-random arrangement of chromosomes, centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres. This orientation is established during mitosis and maintained through subsequent interphase in a range of species. We report that a Rabl-like configuration can be formed de novo without a preceding mitosis during the transition from the sexual phase to the vegetative phase of the life cycle in fission yeast. In this process, each of the dispersed centromeres is often associated with a novel Sad1-containing body that is contacting a cytoplasmic microtubule laterally (Sad1 is a component of the spindle pole body (SPB)). The Sad1-containing body was colocalized with other known SPB components, Kms1 and Spo15 but not with Cut12, indicating that it represents a novel SPB-related complex. The existence of the triplex structure (centromere-microtubule-Sad1 body) suggests that the clustering of centromeres is controlled by a cytoplasmic microtubular system. Accordingly, when microtubules are destabilized, clustering is markedly reduced.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14555468": "There are several reports of a closer-than-random colocalization of homologous chromosomes in the vegetative nuclei of diploid budding yeast. Here, we studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) the nuclear distribution of chromosomes and found a slight tendency toward closer proximity between homologous (allelic) loci than between any nonhomologous chromosomal regions. We show that most of this preferential association is not due to vegetative (also known as somatic) pairing but is caused by the polar orientation of interphase chromosomes (Rabl orientation). We quantified the occasional loss of detectable fluorescence signals that is inherent to the FISH method. Signal loss leads to the occurrence of a single signal that may be misinterpreted as the close association of two homologous chromosomal sites. The nuclear distribution of homologous loci, when corrected for the influence of nuclear architecture and methodological faults, was not different or was only marginally different from a random relative positioning as predicted by computer simulation. We discuss here several possibilities for the residual homologous proximity that do not invoke homology-dependent vegetative pairing, and we conclude that, in diploid budding yeast, constitutive vegetative pairing is a negligible factor for the organization of the interphase nucleus.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20501974": "Biologists have been fascinated for more than 2 centuries about how the nucleus in eukaryotes is organised. Certain of the component parts are well known, but the overall picture is blurred and often confusing. Small genome species have chromosomes in their interphase nuclei disposed in diffuse chromosome territories, without any Rabl arrangement, while in large genomes the chromosomes run string-like through the nucleus with a Rabl orientation following through the cell cycle. What happens in genomes of intermediate size is either a bit of both, depending on the tissue being studied, or still remains to be determined. The centromeres are the most dynamic and least well understood part of the nucleus, subject to rapid evolutionary change and with an epigenetic mark based on a special form of histone CENH3. Nonetheless, the centromere epigenetic mark has been inherited for millions of years by a process that is a complete mystery. Centromeres are involved with the dynamic interactions between chromosomes and other parts of the nuclear environment, such as the nuclear matrix and inner nuclear membrane, and they also engage with the spindle when the order within the nucleus changes during its division. The nucleolus organizer regions have likewise posed tantalising problems about their massive amplification of rDNA sequences, and how they are regulated and expressed. Some of these issues are now becoming clearer with advances in the science and the ongoing development of new molecular tools. These developments are discussed in this contribution, with particular reference to the centromere and the nucleolus organizer.",

In this study we have prepared telomeres built of different combinations of core X, Y' and STARs and have analyzed them in strains lacking Histone-Acetyltransferase genes as well as in cdc6-1 and \u0394rif1 strains. We show that core X and Y' dramatically reduce both positive and negative variations in TPE, that are caused by these mutations. We also show that the deletion of Histone-Acetyltransferase genes reduce the silencing activity of an ACS proto-silencer, but also reduce the anti-silencing activity of a STAR.

We have investigated the influence of these sequences on telomeric silencing. The telomere-proximal portion of either X or Y' dampened silencing when located between the telomere and the reporter gene. These elements were named STARs, for subtelomeric anti-silencing regions. STARs can also counteract silencer-driven repression at the mating-type HML locus. When two STARs bracket a reporter gene, its expression is no longer influenced by surrounding silencing elements, although these are still active on a second reporter gene. In addition, an intervening STAR uncouples the silencing of neighboring genes. STARs thus display the hallmarks of insulators. Protection from silencing is recapitulated by multimerized oligonucleotides representing Tbf1p- and Reb1p-binding sites, as found in STARs. In contrast, sequences located more centromere proximal in X and Y' elements reinforce silencing. They can promote silencing downstream of an insulated expressed domain. Overall, our results suggest that the silencing emanating from telomeres can be propagated in a discontinuous manner via a series of subtelomeric relay elements.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21949764": "Chromatin boundary elements serve as cis-acting regulatory DNA signals required to protect genes from the effects of the neighboring heterochromatin. In the yeast genome, boundary elements act by establishing barriers for heterochromatin spreading and are sufficient to protect a reporter gene from transcriptional silencing when inserted between the silencer and the reporter gene. Here we dissected functional topography of silencers and boundary elements within circular minichromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that both HML-E and HML-I silencers can efficiently repress the URA3 reporter on a multi-copy yeast minichromosome and we further showed that two distinct heterochromatin boundary elements STAR and TEF2-UASrpg are able to limit the heterochromatin spreading in circular minichromosomes. In surprising contrast to what had been observed in the yeast genome, we found that in minichromosomes the heterochromatin boundary elements inhibit silencing of the reporter gene even when just one boundary element is positioned at the distal end of the URA3 reporter or upstream of the silencer elements. Thus the STAR and TEF2-UASrpg boundary elements inhibit chromatin silencing through an antisilencing activity independently of their position or orientation in S. cerevisiae minichromosomes rather than by creating a position-specific barrier as seen in the genome. We propose that the circular DNA topology facilitates interactions between the boundary and silencing elements in the minichromosomes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10228167": "Silencing at native yeast telomeres, in which the subtelomeric elements are intact, is different from silencing at terminal truncations. The repression of URA3 inserted in different subtelomeric positions at several chromosome ends was investigated. Many ends exhibit very little silencing close to the telomere, while others exhibit substantial repression in limited domains. Silencing at native ends is discontinuous, with maximal repression found adjacent to the ARS consensus sequence in the subtelomeric core X element. The level of repression declines precipitously towards the centromere. Mutation of the ARS sequence or an adjacent Abf1p-binding site significantly reduces silencing. The subtelomeric Y' elements are resistant to silencing along their whole length, yet silencing can be re-established at the proximal X element. Deletion of PPR1, the transactivator of URA3, and SIR3 overexpression do not increase repression or extend spreading of silencing to the same extent as with terminally truncated ends. sir1Delta causes partial derepression at X-ACS, in contrast to the lack of effect seen at terminal truncations. orc2-1 and orc5-1 have no effect on natural silencing yet cause derepression at truncated ends. X-ACS silencing requires the proximity of the telomere and is dependent on SIR2, SIR3, SIR4 and HDF1. The structures found at native yeast telomeres appear to limit the potential of repressive chromatin.",

Whether and how periostin expression influences bone anabolism, however, remains unknown. We investigated the skeletal response of adult Postn(-/-) and Postn(+/+) mice to intermittent PTH. Compared with Postn(+/+), Postn(-/-) mice had a lower bone mass, cortical bone volume, and strength response to PTH. PTH-stimulated bone-forming indices were all significantly lower in Postn(-/-) mice, particularly at the periosteum. Furthermore, in vivo stimulation of Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling by PTH, as evaluated in TOPGAL reporter mice, was inhibited in the absence of periostin (TOPGAL;Postn(-/-) mice). PTH stimulated periostin and inhibited MEF2C and sclerostin (Sost) expression in bone and osteoblasts in vitro. Recombinant periostin also suppressed Sost expression, which was mediated through the integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 receptor, whereas periostin-blocking antibody prevented inhibition of MEF2C and Sost by PTH. In turn, administration of a Sost-blocking antiboby partially restored the PTH-mediated increase in bone mass in Postn(-/-) mice. In addition, primary osteoblasts from Postn(-/-) mice showed a lower proliferation, mineralization, and migration, both spontaneously and in response to PTH. Osteoblastic gene expression levels confirmed a defect of Postn(-/-) osteoblast differentiation with and without PTH, as well as an increased osteoblast apoptosis in the absence of periostin. These data elucidate the complex role of periostin on bone anabolism, through the regulation of Sost, Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling, and osteoblast differentiation.",

Found in all eukaryotes, MINDY-family DUBs are highly selective at cleaving K48-linked polyUb, a signal that targets proteins for degradation. We identify the catalytic activity to be encoded within a previously unannotated domain, the crystal structure of which reveals a distinct protein fold with no homology to any of the known DUBs. The crystal structure of MINDY-1 (also known as FAM63A) in complex with propargylated Ub reveals conformational changes that realign the active site for catalysis.

Aberrant plasticity may contribute to the treatment resistance and high relapse rates observed in alcoholics. Recent work suggests that chronic alcohol treatment preferentially modulates both the expression and subcellular localization of NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit. Signaling through synaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDARs has already been implicated in the pathophysiology of various other neurological disorders. NMDARs interact with a large number of proteins at the glutamate synapse, and a better understanding of how alcohol modulates this proteome is needed. We employed a discovery-based proteomic approach in subcellular fractions of hippocampal tissue from chronic intermittent alcohol (CIE)-exposed C57Bl/6J mice to gain insight into alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B signaling complexes. Protein enrichment analyses revealed changes in the association of post-synaptic proteins, including scaffolding, glutamate receptor and PDZ-domain binding proteins with GluN2B. In particular, GluN2B interaction with metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)<sub>1/5</sub> receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD)-associated proteins such as Arc and Homer 1 was increased, while GluA2 was decreased. Accordingly, we found a lack of mGlu<sub>1/5</sub> -induced LTD while \u03b1<sub>1</sub> -adrenergic receptor-induced LTD remained intact in hippocampal CA1 following CIE. These data suggest that CIE specifically disrupts mGlu<sub>1/5</sub> -LTD, representing a possible connection between NMDAR and mGlu receptor signaling. These studies not only demonstrate a new way in which alcohol can modulate plasticity in the hippocampus but also emphasize the utility of this discovery-based proteomic approach to generate new hypotheses regarding alcohol-related mechanisms.",

We employed shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomic and metabonomic profiling approaches on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal (HPC) tissue from Df(16)A<sup>+/-</sup> mice, a model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Proteomic results were compared with previous transcriptomic profiling studies of the same brain regions. The aim was to investigate how the combined effect of the 22q11.2 deletion and the corresponding miRNA dysregulation affects the cell biology at the systems level. The proteomic brain profiling analysis revealed PFC and HPC changes in various molecular pathways associated with chromatin remodelling and RNA transcription, indicative of an epigenetic component of the 22q11.2DS. Further, alterations in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial function and lipid biosynthesis were identified. Metabonomic profiling substantiated the proteomic findings by identifying changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)-related pathways, such as changes in ceramide phosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin, carnitines, tyrosine derivates and panthothenic acid. The proteomic findings were confirmed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, validating decreased levels of several proteins encoded on 22q11.2, increased levels of the computationally predicted putative miR-185 targets UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110 kDa subunit (OGT1) and kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A and alterations in the non-miR-185 targets serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit gamma isoform, neurofilament light chain and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins associated with mammalian target of rapamycin signalling were detected in the PFC and with glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus.

The aim of the present study was (1) to identify molecular changes associated with social and cognitive deficits in the brain tissue of <i>Tsc1</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice and (2) to investigate the molecular effects of rapamycin treatment, which has been shown to ameliorate genotype-related behavioural deficits. Molecular alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of <i>Tsc1</i><sup>+/-</sup> and control mice, with or without rapamycin treatment, were investigated. A quantitative mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomic approach (LC-MS<sup>E</sup>) was employed as an unbiased method to detect changes in protein levels. Changes identified in the initial profiling stage were validated using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Protein Set Enrichment Analysis was employed to identify dysregulated pathways. LC-MS<sup>E</sup> analysis of <i>Tsc1</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice and controls (<i>n</i> = 30) identified 51 proteins changed in frontal cortex and 108 in the hippocampus. Bioinformatic analysis combined with targeted proteomic validation revealed several dysregulated molecular pathways. Using targeted assays, proteomic alterations in the hippocampus validated the pathways \"myelination\", \"dendrite,\" and \"oxidative stress\", an upregulation of ribosomal proteins and the mTOR kinase. LC-MS<sup>E</sup> analysis was also employed on <i>Tsc1</i><sup>+/-</sup> and wildtype mice (<i>n</i> = 34) treated with rapamycin or vehicle. Rapamycin treatment exerted a stronger proteomic effect in <i>Tsc1</i><sup><i>+/-</i></sup> mice with significant changes (mainly decreased expression) in 231 and 106 proteins, respectively. The cellular pathways \"oxidative stress\" and \"apoptosis\" were found to be affected in <i>Tsc1</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice and the cellular compartments \"myelin sheet\" and \"neurofilaments\" were affected by rapamycin treatment. Thirty-three proteins which were altered in <i>Tsc1</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice were normalized following rapamycin treatment, amongst them oxidative stress related proteins, myelin-specific and ribosomal proteins. Molecular changes in the <i>Tsc1</i><sup>+/-</sup> mouse brain were more prominent in the hippocampus compared to the frontal cortex. Pathways linked to myelination and oxidative stress response were prominently affected and, at least in part, normalized following rapamycin treatment.

Recent findings implicate soluble oligomeric amyloid beta as the most relevant protein conformation in AD pathogenesis. We recently described a signaling cascade whereby oligomeric amyloid beta binds to cellular prion protein on the neuronal cell surface, activating intracellular Fyn kinase to mediate synaptotoxicity. Fyn kinase has been implicated in AD pathophysiology both in in vitro models and in human subjects, and is a promising new therapeutic target for AD. Herein, we present a Phase Ib trial of the repurposed investigational drug AZD0530, a Src family kinase inhibitor specific for Fyn and Src kinase, for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The study was a 4-week Phase Ib multiple ascending dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AZD0530 in AD patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranging from 16 to 26. A total of 24 subjects were recruited in three sequential groups, with each randomized to receive oral AZD0530 at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, or placebo daily for 4 weeks. The drug:placebo ratio was 3:1. Primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of AZD0530. Secondary endpoints included changes in clinical efficacy measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes) and regional cerebral glucose metabolism measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. AZD0530 was generally safe and well tolerated across doses. One subject receiving 125 mg of AZD0530 was discontinued from the study due to the development of congestive heart failure and atypical pneumonia, which were considered possibly related to the study drug. Plasma/CSF ratio of AZD0530 was 0.4. The 100 mg and 125 mg doses achieved CSF drug levels corresponding to brain levels that rescued memory deficits in transgenic mouse models. One-month treatment with AZD0530 had no significant effect on clinical efficacy measures or regional cerebral glucose metabolism. AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration with oral dosing at 100-125 mg.

Eleven gene loci from human chromosome 17q (HSA17q) were mapped to the centromeric two-thirds of dog chromosome 9 (CFA9), an acrocentric chromosome of medium size: P4HB, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, BRCA1, RARA, THRA1, MPO, NF1, and CRYBA1. Eight of these were also positioned on a linkage map spanning 38.6 cM. Based on combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the centromere. Canine loci, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, THRA1, and RARA constitute a closely linked group near the centromeric end of CFA9, spanning a genetic distance of only 4.7 cM. Canine NF1 and CRYBA1 lie distally, near the lower border of the Giemsa band adjacent to the distal one-third of CFA9. NF1 and CRYBA1 are loosely linked to the more centromeric group (31.2 cM). No HSA17 genes were found on the telomeric one-third of CFA9.

The identification of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements by cytogenetic techniques serves as an initial screening test for tumour specific aberrations. In murine models of human carcinogenesis, however, karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with mouse chromosome specific painting probes can complement conventional banding analysis. Although sensitive and specific, FISH analyses are restricted to the visualization of only a few mouse chromosomes at a time. Here we apply a novel imaging technique that we developed recently for the visualization of human chromosomes to the simultaneous discernment of all mouse chromosomes. The approach is based on spectral imaging to measure chromosome-specific spectra after FISH with differentially labelled mouse chromosome painting probes. Utilizing a combination of Fourier spectroscopy, CCD-imaging and conventional optical microscopy, spectral imaging allows simultaneous measurement of the fluorescence emission spectrum at all sample points. A spectrum-based classification algorithm has been adapted to karyotype mouse chromosomes. We have applied spectral karyotyping (SKY) to chemically induced plasmocytomas, mammary gland tumours from transgenic mice overexpressing the c-myc oncogene and thymomas from mice deficient for the ataxia telangiectasia (Atm) gene.

Small nerve fibers are altered earlier during the course of the disease; hence, detection of their involvement may have serious consequences on the natural history of disease. A cross-sectional, observational study, was carried out on symptomatic patients, involving the conduct of several tests for small nerve fibers: Vibration, Touch Pressure (TP) and Heat Pain (HP). Results were compared with those obtained during a conventional neurological examination carried out on a group of healthy individuals. Fifteen symptomatic patients were recruited at an early stage of the disease (60% stage 1), along with 13 healthy individuals, with both patient groups having similar epidemiological characteristics in terms of gender, age, weight, height or BMI. A comparison carried out between the neuropsychological tests performed revealed statistically significant differences: Vibration (P&lt;.05), TP (P&lt;.05) and HP (P&lt;.05, except volar forearm). The neurophysiological tests performed revealed significant differences between both groups, allowing for an earlier detection of neurological injuries compared to conventional neurological examinations.",

Five groups of patients were studied: (1) transthyretin (TTR) familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP; n = 20), (2) TTR mutation carriers without peripheral neuropathy (TTR-noPN; n = 10), (3) healthy controls (n = 20), (4) diabetic neuropathy disease controls (n = 20), and (5) patients with light-chain (AL) amyloid (n = 2). All subjects underwent neurological examination and 3mm skin biopsies. Sections were stained with anti-PGP9.5, anti-TTR, and Congo red. Intraepidermal (IENFD), sweat gland (SGNFD), and pilomotor nerve fiber densities (PMNFD) were measured. Correlations between the amount of amyloid present (amyloid burden), fiber subtype, and Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) were evaluated. IENFD, SGNFD, and PMNFD were all significantly reduced in TTR-FAP patients versus healthy controls, whereas TTR-noPN subjects had intermediate reductions. Lower nerve fiber densities were associated with NIS-LL (p &lt; 0.001). Congo red staining revealed brilliant red amyloid deposits confirmed by apple-green birefringence within dermal collagen, sweat glands, and arrector pili that engulfed axons. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to detect amyloid in skin were 70% and 100%. Both AL amyloidosis and 2 of 10 TTR-noPN subjects were Congo red-positive. Amyloid burden correlated with IENFD (r = -0.63), SGNFD (r = -0.67), PMNFD (r = -0.50), and NIS-LL (r = -0.57). Wild-type TTR staining was less prominent in TTR-FAP patients. Cutaneous amyloid was detected in 70% of TTR-FAP and 20% of TTR-noPN subjects. Amyloid burden correlated strongly with reductions in IENFD, SGNFD, PMNFD, and NIS-LL.

Since its first description, more than 120 amyloidogenic transthyretin mutations have been reported with various geographic distributions and associated with a wide range of phenotypes involving the peripheral nerve, the heart, the gastrointestinal tract, the eyes, the central nervous system, or the kidneys. In some cases of transthyretin amyloidosis, the first clinical manifestation is vitreous opacity. A 46-year-old Bangladeshi woman presented with vitreous amyloidosis and progressive autonomic neuropathy of the digestive tract as initial clinical manifestations, with no clinical evidence of cardiac, renal, central nervous system, or peripheral nerve dysfunction. A novel transthyretin mutation, p.Gly87Arg, was identified in the heterozygous state in this proband of Bangladeshi origin. Histological examination of accessory salivary glands and gastric biopsies revealed Congo-red-positive deposits. Laser microdissection of salivary gland Congo-red deposits and tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis identified the mutated transthyretin peptide containing the arginine residue at position 87 of the mature protein. Vitreous amyloidosis should be considered a differential diagnosis of uveitis, in particular transthyretin amyloidosis. Proteomics data from our case, consistent with the genetic findings, highly suggests that this new p.Gly87Arg variant is amyloidogenic. Here, we described the second case of transthyretin amyloidosis reported in a Bangladeshi patient.",

The tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence measurements typically used to study structural changes of TTR do not yield site-specific information on the two Trp residues per TTR protomer. To obtain such information, tryptophan labeled with fluorine at the 5 and 6 positions (5FW and 6FW) was incorporated into TTR. Fluorescence of 5FW and 6FW-labeled WT-TTR (WT-5FW and WT-6FW) and a single-Trp mutant W41Y showed that the photophysics of incorporated fluoro-Trp is consistent with site-specific solvation of the indole ring of W41 and W79. <sup>19</sup>F-NMR showed that solvent accessibility depends on both the location of the Trp and the position of the fluorine substituent in the indole ring. Unexpectedly, differences were observed in the rates of aggregation, with WT-6FW aggregating more rapidly than WT-5FW or WT-TTR. Real-time <sup>19</sup>F-NMR urea unfolding experiments revealed that WT-5FW is kinetically more stable than WT-6FW, consistent with the aggregation assay. In addition, structural perturbations of residues distant from either Trp site are more extensive in WT-6FW. Notably, residues in the dimer interfaces are perturbed by 6FW at residue 79; pathogenic mutations in these regions are associated with reduced tetramer stability and amyloidogenesis. The differences in behavior that arise from the replacement of a fluorine at the 5-position of a tryptophan with one at the adjacent 6-position emphasize the delicate balance of stability in the TTR tetramer.",

Referred to as TTR-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), this group of diseases is frequently life threatening and fatal if untreated. ATTR, caused by amyloid-forming variant TTR proteins (ATTRm) that arise from point mutations in the TTR gene, were classically referred to as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) or familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), reflecting the clinical phenotype. FAC and FAP are pathologies that can be challenging to diagnose as there are no definitive biomarkers of disease; moreover, disease-specific measures of progression are lacking, and treatment options are limited. Thus, the discovery of sensitive and specific indicators of disease has the potential to improve recognition, enable accurate measurement of amyloid progression and response to treatment, and reveal key information regarding FAC and FAP pathobiological mechanisms. In this study, the goal was to investigate serum proteomic features unique to FAC and FAP types of ATTRm. Multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS), a powerful technique in profiling proteomes, was used to measure the serum concentrations of 160 proteins in samples from FAC and FAP patients. Results were compared to data from healthy control sera obtained from individuals matched to age (\u226560 years), gender (male), and race (Caucasian). Proteomic analyses of ATTRm (FAC and FAP) and control samples showed significant concentration differences in 107 of 192 (56%) of the serum proteins that were studied. In comparing FAC to FAP, differences in concentrations as well as interactions and functions of several proteins were identified as unique to each disease; significantly lower levels of TTR were specific to FAC, but not to FAP. Annotated functional clustering identified extracellular region, signal, and signal peptide as terms common to FAC and FAP. Conversely, disulfide bond was unique to FAC; secreted, glycosylation site: N-linked, glycosylation, glycoprotein, polymorphism, and sequence variant were associated solely with FAP. Predicted protein-protein associations in FAC were seen for reaction, binding, and activation processes; no associations were found in FAP. This study demonstrates significant proteomic differences between ATTRm patient and control sera, as well as ATTRm phenotype-associated variations in the circulating levels of several proteins including TTR. The identification of serum proteins unique to FAC and FAP may have diagnostic and prognostic utility and could possibly provide important clues about disease mechanisms.",

The UK population is unique in that the majority of patients have the T60A missense mutation in ATTR where tyrosine is replaced by adenine at position 60. This has been traced to a single founder mutation from north-west Ireland. The neuropathy phenotype is less well described than the cardiac manifestations in this group. We present the findings from an observational cohort study of patients with ATTR attending the National Hospital Inherited Neuropathy Clinic between 2009 and 2013. Detailed clinical neurological and electrophysiological data were collected on all patients alongside correlating autonomic and cardiac assessments. Follow-up data were available on a subset. Forty-four patients with genetically confirmed ATTR were assessed; 37 were symptomatic; mean age at onset=62 years, range=38-75 years; 75.7% male. T60A was the most common mutation (17/37), followed by V30M (5/37). A severe, rapidly progressive, predominantly length dependent axonal sensorimotor neuropathy was the predominant phenotype. T60A patients were distinguished by earlier and more frequent association with carpal tunnel syndrome; a predominance of negative sensory symptoms at onset; significant vibration deficits; and a non-length dependent progression of motor deficit. Progression of the neuropathy was observed over a relatively short follow-up period (2 years) in 20 patients with evidence of clinically measurable annual change in Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (-1.5 points per year) and Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS:2.7 points per year), and a congruent trend in the electrophysiological measures used.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25121490": "Many developmental, physiological, and behavioral processes depend on the precise expression of genes in space and time. Such spatiotemporal gene expression phenotypes arise from the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) to DNA, and from the regulation of nearby genes that such binding causes. These nearby genes may themselves encode TFs, giving rise to a transcription factor network (TFN), wherein nodes represent TFs and directed edges denote regulatory interactions between TFs. Computational studies have linked several topological properties of TFNs - such as their degree distribution - with the robustness of a TFN's gene expression phenotype to genetic and environmental perturbation. Another important topological property is assortativity, which measures the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect. In directed networks, assortativity comprises four distinct components that collectively form an assortativity signature. We know very little about how a TFN's assortativity signature affects the robustness of its gene expression phenotype to perturbation. While recent theoretical results suggest that increasing one specific component of a TFN's assortativity signature leads to increased phenotypic robustness, the biological context of this finding is currently limited because the assortativity signatures of real-world TFNs have not been characterized. It is therefore unclear whether these earlier theoretical findings are biologically relevant. Moreover, it is not known how the other three components of the assortativity signature contribute to the phenotypic robustness of TFNs. Here, we use publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. We find that all TFNs share a common assortativity signature and that this signature confers phenotypic robustness to model TFNs. Lastly, we determine the extent to which each of the four components of the assortativity signature contributes to this robustness.",

Assortativity is a network property used in social sciences to identify factors affecting how people establish social ties. We propose a new approach, using chromatin assortativity, to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the association of these features with the topology of four chromatin interaction networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network. Polycomb group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centered networks. We then ask which features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the actively elongating form of RNA polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared with inactive forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Contacts among promoters and between promoters and other elements have different characteristic epigenomic features. We identify a possible role for the elongating form of RNAPII in mediating interactions among promoters, enhancers, and transcribed gene bodies. Our approach facilitates the study of multiple genome-wide epigenomic profiles, considering network topology and allowing the comparison of chromatin interaction networks.",

A random-effects bivariate model was used to estimate the summary sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of the tools. We identified 108 studies including a total of 47 989 participants. The summary estimates were calculated for the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS in detecting mild (AHI/RDI \u2265 5 events/h), moderate (AHI/RDI \u2265 15 events/h), and severe OSA (AHI/RDI \u2265 30 events/h). The performance levels of the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS in detecting OSA of various severity levels are outlined as follows: for mild OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 76%, 88%, 87%, and 54%; pooled specificity levels were 59%, 42%, 42%, and 65%; and pooled DORs were 4.30, 5.13, 4.85, and 2.18, respectively. For moderate OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 77%, 90%, 89%, and 47%; pooled specificity levels were 44%, 36%, 32%, and 621%; and pooled DORs were 2.68, 5.05, 3.71, and 1.45, respectively. For severe OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 84%, 93%, 90%, and 58%; pooled specificity levels were 38%, 35%, 28%, and 60%; and pooled DORs were 3.10, 6.51, 3.37, and 2.10, respectively. Therefore, for mild, moderate, and severe OSA, the pooled sensitivity and DOR of the SBQ were significantly higher than those of other screening tools (P &lt; .05); however, the specificity of the SBQ was lower than that of the ESS (P &lt; .05). Moreover, age, sex, body mass index, study sample size, study populations, presence of comorbidities, PSG or portable monitoring performance, and risk of bias in the domains of the index test and reference standard were significant moderators of sensitivity and specificity (P &lt; .05). Compared with the BQ, STOP, and ESS, the SBQ is a more accurate tool for detecting mild, moderate, and severe OSA. Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for the early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings, particularly in resource-poor countries and sleep clinics where PSG is unavailable.",

One example, the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), has been validated as a screening tool with high sensitivity. However, its specificity may result in a high false-positive rate. The aim of this study to determine if addition of the Modified Mallampati score to the SBQ improves its specificity. The authors studied 162 patients referred to the Sleep Disorders Clinic at Yedikule Chest Disease Education and Research Hospital. All patients were prospectively screened for risk of OSA using the SBQ, their oral anatomy was assessed by Modified Mallampati scoring, and sleep quality characterized by polysomnography. Polysomnography results were reviewed when available and the predictive performance of the SBQ and the modified SBQ scoring models were compared. In the authors' study an SBQ score \u22653 yielded sensitivities of 0.85, 0.86, and 0.91 for Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) \u22655/h, AHI \u226515/h, and AHI \u226530/h, respectively, and specificities of 0.09, 0.10, and 0.18. The modified SBQ with a cutoff of \u22654 (&gt;3) points for AHI levels of &gt;5, &gt;15, and &gt;30 yielded respective sensitivities of 0.84, 0.86, and 0.91 and specificities of 0.25, 0.26, and 0.27. The author's results from indicated the modified SBQ with a cutoff of &gt;3 points in this study was more specific than the standard SBQ but no less sensitive, and may be used in identifying OSA patients for further diagnostic evaluation or avoiding unnecessary testing.",

The burden of SA among stroke survivors in sub-Saharan Africa where stroke incidence and mortality are escalating is unknown. We sought to assess the prevalence of SA risk and its clinical correlates and predictors among Ghanaian stroke survivors. This cross-sectional study involved 200 consecutive stroke survivors attending a neurology clinic in a tertiary medical center in Kumasi, Ghana. The validated Berlin, STOP-BANG, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaires were administered to all eligible subjects to assess SA risk and daytime somnolence, and their demographic and clinical information, health-related quality of life, and symptoms of depression were collected using the questionnaires. The median (interquartile range) age of stroke survivors was 62 (52-72) years and 52.5% were male. Ninety-nine (49.5%) subjects were identified as high risk for SA using the Berlin questionnaire, whereas 26 (13%), 137 (68.5%), and 37 (18.5%) subjects were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk for SA, respectively, using the STOP-BANG questionnaire. Patients at high risk of SA were significantly older, used excess alcohol, and were less able to perform activities of daily living, although their mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly lower than those with low risk for SA. None of the stroke survivors had ever been screened for SA. One out of every 2 stroke survivors attending a neurology clinic in Ghana is at high risk for undiagnosed SA. Greater regional awareness about SA presence and outcomes among patients and providers is warranted.",

Subjects with obstructive events and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) \u22655 were considered to have OSA. The likelihood ratios (LRs) and other performance characteristics were calculated for the following nine questionnaires: Berlin, modified Berlin, STOP, STOP-Bang and OSA50 questionnaires, sleep apnea clinical score (SACS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) checklist, and the elbow sign questionnaire. Two-hundred and ten subjects (mean age, 46.5 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 31.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 27.1% women) were included. OSA was diagnosed in 78.1% of patients; 49.5% had severe OSA (AHI \u226530). The SACS questionnaire had the highest positive LR (LR+, 5.6) and positive predictive value (95.2%). The modified Berlin questionnaire had the best negative LR (LR-, 0.2) and the highest negative predictive value (57.1%). The STOP-Bang questionnaire also had an LR- of 0.2 if BMI threshold of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (like that in the modified Berlin questionnaire) was used. Among individual items of various sleep questionnaires, the highest LR+ was obtained for neck circumference &gt;43 cm (LR+, 4.9), while the best LR- was obtained for snoring and BMI &gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (LR-, 0.2). The SACS and the STOP-Bang questionnaires (BMI threshold of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were found to provide the best positive and negative LRs, respectively, for the prediction of OSA.

Observational study. Tertiary academic center preoperative clinic. Two hundred patients presenting for elective surgery to the University of Utah preoperative clinic. Abbreviated transthoracic right-sided echocardiogram and STOP-Bang questionnaire. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler-derived tricuspid lateral annular systolic velocity (S'), and the tricuspid inflow E wave to tricuspid annular tissue Doppler e' wave ratio (E/e') for the presence of RHD, as well as responses to STOP-Bang questionnaire.

Thirty-five patients (25%) reported 5 or more positive responses to the STOP-Bang questionnaire. Forty-six patients (35%) had abnormal right-sided heart measurements. Of the 35 patients with STOP-Bang scores 5 or greater, 11 (31%) had evidence of RHD. No correlation was observed between STOP-Bang scores and the echocardiography metrics of RHD. This preliminary study suggests that there are numerous sources of RHD, among one of which is sleep apnea, and/or the STOP-Bang questionnaire is not a sensitive tool for predicting RHD.

The STOP-Bang questionnaire is a validated screening tool for OSA. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of STOP-Bang for screening patients suspected of having OSA and to predict its accuracy in determining the severity of OSA in the different populations. A search of the literature databases was performed. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Studies that used STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for OSA in adult subjects (&gt;18 years); 2) The accuracy of the STOP-Bang questionnaire was validated by polysomnography--the gold standard for diagnosing OSA; 3) OSA was clearly defined as apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) \u2265 5; 4) Publications in the English language. The quality of the studies were explicitly described and coded according to the Cochrane Methods group on the screening and diagnostic tests. Seventeen studies including 9,206 patients met criteria for the systematic review. In the sleep clinic population, the sensitivity was 90%, 94% and 96% to detect any OSA (AHI \u2265 5), moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI \u226515), and severe OSA (AHI \u226530) respectively. The corresponding NPV was 46%, 75% and 90%. A similar trend was found in the surgical population. In the sleep clinic population, the probability of severe OSA with a STOP-Bang score of 3 was 25%. With a stepwise increase of the STOP-Bang score to 4, 5, 6 and 7/8, the probability rose proportionally to 35%, 45%, 55% and 75%, respectively. In the surgical population, the probability of severe OSA with a STOP-Bang score of 3 was 15%.

The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A recent meta-analysis confirmed that STOP-Bang is validated for use in the sleep clinic, surgical, and general population. Patients with a STOP-Bang score of 0--2 can be classified as low-risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. Those with a score of 5--8 can be classified as high-risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. In patients with a score of 3 or 4, a specific combination of a STOP score at least 2 + BMI more than 35 kg/m or STOP score at least 2 + male or STOP score at least 2 + neck circumference more than 40 cm indicates higher risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. Further, patients with a STOP-Bang score at least 3 can be classified as high risk for moderate-to-severe OSA if the serum HCO3 at least 28 mmol/l. STOP-Bang can be used as a novel tool for perioperative risk stratification because it easily identifies patients who are at increased risk of perioperative complications. STOP-Bang at least 3 was recommended previously to identify the suspected or undiagnosed OSA. To reduce the false positive cases and to improve its specificity, a stepwise stratification is recommended to identify the patients at high risk of moderate-to-severe OSA. Because of its practical application, STOP-Bang is a useful screening tool for patients with suspected or undiagnosed OSA.",

Few studies have examined whether postoperative complications are increased in HR patients and none have been described in oncologic patients. Objective. This retrospective study examined if HR patients experience increased complications evidenced by an increased length of stay (LOS) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods. We retrospectively measured LOS and the frequency of oxygen desaturation (&lt;93%) in cancer patients who were given the STOP-BANG questionnaire prior to cystoscopy for urologic disease in an ambulatory surgery center. Results. The majority of patients in our study were men (77.7%), over the age of 50 (90.1%), and had BMI &lt; 30 kg/m(2) (88.4%). STOP-BANG results were obtained on 404 patients. Cumulative incidence of the time to discharge between HR and the LR groups was plotted. By 8 hours, LR patients showed a higher cumulative probability of being discharged early (80% versus 74%, P = 0.008). Conclusions. Urologic oncology patients at HR for OSA based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire were less likely to be discharged early from the PACU compared to LR patients.",

Questionnaires that are used to determine obstructive sleep apnoea risk are not widely used for surgical patients. Among the questionnaires that are commonly used for obstructive sleep apnoea screening, it remains unclear whether the STOP-BANG or Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaire is more effective in terms of ease of use, usage period and diagnosis of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnoea risk. This study was designed as a descriptive and prospective study. The study included 126 patients over 18 years of age who were American Society of Anesthesiologists classification class I-II and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To determine the potential obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome risk, the STOP-BANG and Berlin questionnaires were administered. Respiratory complications were then observed during the perioperative period. During intubation and extubation, we observed statistically significant differences in difficult intubation, difficult facemask ventilation and desaturation frequency between the high- and low-risk groups for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire. During extubation, statistically significant differences in coughing, breath-holding and desaturation frequency were observed between the high-risk and low-risk groups, according to the Berlin questionnaire. In the post-anaesthesia care unit, both questionnaires found statistically significant differences between the low- and high-risk groups. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome screening questionnaires administered during the preoperative period are useful for predicting perioperative respiratory complications. It may be most useful to administer the STOP-BANG questionnaire as the initial evaluation. Questionnaires may be used to determine the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, which could impact the anaesthetisation of surgical patients. Questionnaires for determining the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome should be used regularly for surgical patients, and these questionnaires should be used to improve clinical protocols for anaesthesia and postanaesthesia care.",

OSA is usually diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) and, if untreated, could lead to life-threatening complications. Many screening questionnaires have been developed to screen and identify patients at high risk for OSA. This study aimed to evaluate and validate the Arabic version of Stop-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for patients with OSA symptoms referred to a sleep clinic. All referred Arabic-speaking adult patients presenting to a Sleep Disorders Specialized Clinic in Al Ain for PSG were requested to complete an Arabic STOP-Bang questionnaire. A score of 3 or more out of a possible 8 was taken to indicate high risk for presence of OSA. These scores were then evaluated versus results from the overnight, monitored PSG. Apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of \u22655/h was considered for diagnosis of OSA. One hundred ninety-three sleep clinic patients were enrolled in this study. PSG was positive (AHI \u22655) in 85 % of the studied population. STOP-Bang questionnaire was positive (\u22653) in 87 % of the population. Reproducibility of STOP-Bang questionnaire was tested, and the intraclass correlation coefficient of the total score of STOP-Bang questionnaire was 0.931 (95 % CI 0.834-0.972).

Subjects with asthma were recruited by general practitioners during a control visit. Physicians compiled a questionnaire that assessed the presence of AR according to ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma) guidelines and factors influencing the risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, smoking). Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating the presence and severity of AR and the STOP-BANG questionnaire (snoring, tiredness during daytime, observed apnea, high blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck circumference, gender), a validated screening method to identify obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk. Physicians were blinded to the subjects' questionnaires, ensuring objectivity of the method. The analyses were conducted on 1,941 subjects (males 58%, mean age 48.2 \u00b1 15.2 y): 740 with asthma alone and 1,201 with asthma and AR. STOP-BANG revealed that 52.6% of the subjects were at increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: 47.3% of subjects with asthma alone and 55.9% of patients with asthma and AR. Rhinitis was associated with a 1.44 times higher odds ratio for having obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk. Rhinitis duration and severity were associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk, although the latter deserved greater importance. The results showed that, once a correction for each of these factors was performed, subjects with AR with an odds ratio of 1.99 were reported to be at risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The probable increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with the concomitant presence of rhinitis, independent of obesity and other contributors to risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.",

The high-risk group patients identified by STOP-BANG had significantly higher respiratory disturbance index and lower minimum oxygen saturation than the low-risk group patients. Among the four questionnaires studied, STOP-BANG, with only eight questions and the highest sensitivity, is the best questionnaire of the four for OSA screening. This can potentially assist in prioritizing PSG and can be helpful in clinical or self-evaluation by the general public.",

The sole licensed preventive treatment against RSV is composed of a monoclonal neutralizing antibody (palivizumab), which targets a conformational epitope located on the fusion protein (F). Palivizumab reduces the burden of bronchiolitis but does not prevent infection. Thus, the development of RSV vaccines remains a priority. We previously evaluated nanorings formed by RSV nucleoprotein (N) as an RSV vaccine, as well as an immunostimulatory carrier for heterologous antigens. Here, we linked the palivizumab-targeted epitope (called FsII) to N, to generate N-FsII-nanorings. Intranasal N-FsII immunization elicited anti-F antibodies in mice that were non-neutralizing in vitro. Nevertheless, RSV-challenged animals were better protected against virus replication than mice immunized with N-nanorings, especially in the upper airways. In conclusion, an N-FsII-focused vaccine is an attractive candidate combining N-specific cellular immunity and F-specific antibodies for protection.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28084708": "Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of this infection. RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake. Educating parents on reducing the risk of infection is one of the most important things a physician can do to help prevent RSV infection, especially early in life. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273842": "The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the causative agent for high rates of hospitalizations due to viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia worldwide. Such a disease is characterized by an infection of epithelial cells of the distal airways that leads to inflammation and subsequently to respiratory failure. Upon infection, different pattern recognition receptors recognize the virus and trigger the innate immune response against the hRSV. Further, T cell immunity plays an important role for virus clearance. Based on animal studies, it is thought that the host immune response to hRSV is based on a biased T helper (Th)-2 and Th17 T cell responses with the recruitment of T cells, neutrophils and eosinophils to the lung, causing inflammation and tissue damage. In contrast, human immunity against RSV has been shown to be more complex with no definitive T cell polarization profile. Nowadays, only a humanized monoclonal antibody, known as palivizumab, is available to protect against hRSV infection in high-risk infants. However, such treatment involves several injections at a significantly high cost. For these reasons, intense research has been focused on finding novel vaccines or therapies to prevent hRSV infection in the population. Here, we comprehensively review the recent literature relative to the immunological features during hRSV infection, as well as the new insights into preventing the disease caused by this virus.",

However, its relatively low neutralizing potency and high cost have limited its use to a restricted population of infants at high risk of severe disease. Previously, we isolated a high-potency neutralizing antibody, 5C4, that specifically recognizes antigenic site \u00d8 at the apex of the pre-F protein trimer. We compared <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> the potency and protective efficacy of 5C4 and the murine precursor of palivizumab, antibody 1129. Both antibodies were synthesized on identical murine backbones as either an IgG1 or IgG2a subclass and evaluated for binding to multiple F protein conformations, <i>in vitro</i> inhibition of RSV infection and propagation, and protective efficacy in mice. Although 1129 and 5C4 had similar pre-F protein binding affinities, the 5C4 neutralizing activity was nearly 50-fold greater than that of 1129 <i>in vitro</i> In BALB/c mice, 5C4 reduced the peak titers of RSV 1,000-fold more than 1129 did in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. These data indicate that antibodies specific for antigenic site \u00d8 are more efficacious at preventing RSV infection than antibodies specific for antigenic site II. Our data also suggest that site \u00d8-specific antibodies may be useful for the prevention or treatment of RSV infection and support the use of the pre-F protein as a vaccine antigen.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> There is no vaccine yet available to prevent RSV infection. The use of the licensed antibody palivizumab, which recognizes site II on both the pre-F and post-F proteins, is restricted to prophylaxis in neonates at high risk of severe RSV disease. Recommendations for using passive immunization in the general population or for therapy in immunocompromised persons with persistent infection is limited because of cost, determined from the high doses needed to compensate for its relatively low neutralizing potency. Prior efforts to improve the <i>in vitro</i> potency of site II-specific antibodies did not translate to significant <i>in vivo</i> dose sparing. We isolated a pre-F protein-specific, high-potency neutralizing antibody (5C4) that recognizes antigenic site \u00d8 and compared its efficacy to that of the murine precursor of palivizumab (antibody 1129) matched for isotype and pre-F protein binding affinities. Our findings demonstrate that epitope specificity is an important determinant of antibody neutralizing potency, and defining the mechanisms of neutralization has the potential to identify improved products for the prevention and treatment of RSV infection.",

RSV-related hospitalization, time to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) 1st isolate, lung function and growth parameters were recorded. Comparisons were made for outcomes pre- and post-introduction of routine palivizumab administration in 2002. A cost evaluation was also performed. Ninety-two children were included; 47 pre- and 45 post-palivizumab introduction. The overall RSV-positive hospitalization rate was 13%. The relative risk of RSV infection in palivizumab non-recipients versus recipients was 4.78 (95%CI: 1.1-20.7), P = 0.027. Notably, PA 1st isolate was significantly earlier in the palivizumab recipient cohort versus non-recipient cohort (median 57 vs. 96 months, P &lt; 0.025) with a relative risk of 2.5.

It is the second largest cause of mortality, after malaria, in infants outside the neonatal period and causes up to 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. RSV results in clinical syndromes that include upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, bronchiolitis (up to 80% of cases) and lower respiratory tract disease including pneumonia and exacerbations of asthma or viral-induced wheeze. For the purposes of this review we will focus on RSV bronchiolitis in infants in whom the greatest disease burden lies. For infants requiring hospital admission, the identification of the causative respiratory virus is used to direct cohorting or isolation and infection control procedures to minimize nosocomial transmission. Nosocomial RSV infections are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including increased mortality, the need for mechanical ventilation and longer length of hospital stay. Numerous clinical guidelines for the management of infants with bronchiolitis have been published, although none are specific for RSV bronchiolitis. Ribavirin is the only licensed drug for the specific treatment of RSV infection but due to drug toxicity and minimal clinical benefit it has not been recommended for routine clinical use. There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent RSV infection but passive immunoprophylaxis using a monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 39-78% in various high-risk infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease. The current management of RSV bronchiolitis is purely supportive, with feeding support and oxygen supplementation until the infant immune system mounts a response capable of controlling the disease.

To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting. A decision-tree model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, used as a preventative treatment against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, in high-risk groups of children in the Netherlands. The analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up period in order to capture the impact of palivizumab on long-term morbidity and mortality resulting from an RSV infection. Data sources included published literature, the palivizumab pivotal trials, official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The study was conducted from the perspective of society in the Netherlands. The use of palivizumab results in undiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of \u20ac12,728/QALY and \u20ac4,256/QALY in preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease indications, respectively. Inclusion of indirect costs leads to even more favourable cost-effectiveness outcomes. The study is limited by a number of conservative assumptions. It was assumed that palivizumab only affects the occurrence of RSV hospitalisation and does not influence the severity of the RSV infection. Another assumption was that international clinical trial data and data on utilities could be applied to the Dutch healthcare setting. Palivizumab provides cost-effective prophylaxis against RSV in high-risk infants. The use of palivizumab in these children results in positive short- and long-term health-economic benefits.",

A three-level educational intervention was conducted: the parents were advised in the neonatology units, then at the hospital pharmacy where the treatment was delivered, and finally by their referent pediatrician. We evaluated the impact of this intervention by measuring patient compliance, defined by two criteria, and by measuring the rate of rehospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis.

We demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are sensitive to temporal presentation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D but with different responses between the factors. The greatest LEC mitogenic and sprouting response was observed for constant concentrations of VEGF-C and a high initial concentration that gradually decreased over time for VEGF-D. Additionally, alginate hydrogels provided sustained release of radiolabeled VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Finally, VEGF-C and VEGF-D released from these hydrogels promoted a similar number of LEC sprouts as exogenously added growth factors and new vasculature in vivo via a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Overall, these findings demonstrate that alginate hydrogels can provide sustained and bioactive release of VEGF-C and VEGF-D which could have applications for therapeutic lymphangiogenesis.",

Here we show that transient ectopic overexpression of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) induces PAR accumulation, PARP-1, and CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the same mouse fibroblasts. The persistence in time of a high PAR level affects the DNA methylation machinery; the DNA methyltransferase activity is inhibited with consequences for the methylation state of genome, which becomes diffusely hypomethylated affecting centromeric minor satellite and B1 DNA repeats. In vitro data show that CTCF is able to activate PARP-1 automodification even in the absence of nicked DNA. Our new finding that CTCF is able per se to activate PARP-1 automodification in vitro is of great interest as so far a burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 has generally been found following introduction of DNA strand breaks. CTCF is unable to inhibit DNMT1 activity, whereas poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 plays this inhibitory role. These data suggest that CTCF is involved in the cross-talk between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation and underscore the importance of a rapid reversal of PARP activity, as DNA methylation pattern is responsible for an important epigenetic code.",

It is believed that the protein performs such a variety of functions by interacting with an array of very diverse proteins. In addition, CTCF undergoes several post-translational modifications, including poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The PARylated form of CTCF has recently been implicated in two important functions: gene imprinting and control of ribosomal gene transcription. Here, we summarize and critically discuss the available data on the interplay between CTCF and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in these two processes. We consider the newly described phenomena in the broader context of PARP's activities, including the crucial role of protein PARylation in the regulation of the genome methylation pattern.",

In a cross-sectional study, 100 apparently normal healthy subjects and, 47 type 2 diabetic subjects were selected from either sex with ages between 18-65 years. Subjects were measured for waist/hip ratio, BMI and serum levels of ALT, AST, Alk phosphatase and glutamyl transferase (GGT). The study excluded by screening for AntiHCV, HBsAg and patients with aspartate amino transferase (SGOT), alanine amino transferase (SGPT), GGT levels more than three times the normal and subject with a total leukocyte count more than 10,000/microl. The levels of GGT levels were found to be most significant among all the liver enzymes (P = 0.001). The levels of GGT compared with type 2 diabetics was found to be significantly increased when compared with BMI, waist/circumference, cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), fasting blood sugar level and blood pressure (P = 0.001). The pearson regression analysis showed a positive relation with systolic, diastolic blood pressure and fasting blood sugar. These results indicate that levels of GGT were raised with increased waist girth, BMI, blood pressure TG and low HDL, all of these are the features of metabolic syndrome according to ATP III criteria. Hence, serum GGT may be an important investigation for diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",

Using brother-sister mating with pedigree expansion system, we derived a colony of heterozygous breeding females showing ER-Positive tumors around the age of 6 months. Complete blood picture, differential leukocyte count, and serum levels of Estrogen, Alanine amino transferase (SGPT), Aspartate amino transferase (SGOT), total protein and albumin were estimated. Aspiration biopsies and microbiology were carried out. Gross pathology of the tumors and their metastatic potential were assessed. The tumors were excised and further characterized using histopathology, cytology, electron microscopy (EM), molecular markers and Mouse mammary Tumor Virus - Long Terminal Repeats (MMTV LTR) specific RT-PCR. The tumors originated from 2nd or 5th or both the mammary glands and were multi-nodulated with variable central necrosis accompanied with an accumulation of inflammatory exudate. Significant increases in estrogen, SGPT, SGOT and neutrophils levels were noticed. Histopathologically, invasive nodular masses of pleomorphic tubular neoplastic epithelial cells invaded fibro-vascular stroma, adjacent dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Metastatic spread through hematogenous and regional lymph nodes, into liver, lungs, spleen, heart and dermal lymphatics was observed. EM picture revealed no viral particles and MMTV-negativity was confirmed through MMTV LTR-specific RT-PCR. High expression of ER alpha, moderate to high expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), moderate expression of vimentin and Cytokeratin 19 (K19) and low expression of p53 were observed in tumor sections, when compared with that of the normal mammary gland. Since 75% of human breast cancer were classified ER-positive and as our model mimics (in most of the characteristics, such as histopathology, metastasis, high estrogen levels) the ER-positive luminal epithelial-like human breast cancer, this model will be an attractive tool to understand the biology of estrogen-dependant breast cancer in women. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a spontaneous mammary model displaying regional lymph node involvement with both hematogenous and lymphatic spread to liver, lung, heart, spleen and lymph nodes.",

Changes in the chemical structure of synthetic oligonucleotides make them more stable and specific, and new delivery strategies became progressively available. The attention of pharmaceutical industry rapidly turned to RNAi, as an opportunity to explore new drug targets. This review addresses nine small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and one unique microRNA (miRNA) inhibitor, which entered the phase 2-3 clinical trials. The siRNAs in focus are PF-04523655, TKM-080301, Atu027, SYL040012, SYL1001, siG12D-LODER (phase 2), QPI-1002, QPI-1007, and patisiran (phase 3). Regarding miRNAs, their content can be down- or up-regulated, by using miRNA inhibitors (AntimiRs) or miRNA mimics. Miravirsen is an AntimiR-122 for hepatitis C virus infection. The flexibility of RNAi technology is easily understood taking into account: (i) the different drug targets (i.e. p53, caspase 2, PKN3, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, mutated KRAS, microRNAs); (ii) therapeutic conditions, including ophthalmic diseases, kidney injury, amyloidosis, pancreatic cancer, viral hepatitis; and (iii) routes of administration (ocular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratumoral).

This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of patisiran (ALN-TTR02), a small interfering RNA encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles, in patients with transthyretin-mediated familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). In this phase II study, patients with FAP were administered 2 intravenous infusions of patisiran at one of the following doses: 0.01 (n = 4), 0.05 (n = 3), 0.15 (n = 3), or 0.3 (n = 7) mg/kg every 4 weeks (Q4W), or 0.3 mg/kg (n = 12) every 3 weeks (Q3W). Of 29 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 26 completed the study. Administration of patisiran led to rapid, dose-dependent, and durable knockdown of transthyretin, with the maximum effect seen with patisiran 0.3 mg/kg; levels of mutant and wild-type transthyretin were reduced to a similar extent in Val30Met patients. A mean level of knockdown exceeding 85 % after the second dose, with maximum knockdown of 96 %, was observed for the Q3W dose. The most common treatment-related adverse event (AE) was mild-to-moderate infusion-related reactions in 10.3 % of patients. Four serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 1 patient administered 0.3 mg/kg Q3W (urinary tract infection, sepsis, nausea, vomiting), and 1 patient administered 0.3 mg/kg Q4W had 1 SAE (extravasation-related cellulitis).

Although there are a number of plausible explanations for this extremely high attrition rate, one of the explanations that has received little attention is the lack of compelling data from Phase II studies for compounds that have been pushed into Phase III trials and then have failed. An analysis of publicly available data from the Phase II studies for bapineuzumab and solanezumab indicates that neither compound produced compelling evidence of drug-like behavior that would justify their progression into pivotal trials. The published data suggest that sponsors took decisions to move these compounds into Phase III on the basis of vastly limited data that were rife with type I error and probably driven by commercial concerns. The continued push to move compounds that are not likely to succeed in later stage clinical trials threatens to erode trust in the clinical research enterprise making it much harder to properly test truly promising compounds.",

Accordingly, inhibiting aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid \u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein, has been a main therapeutic target for these disorders. Among various strategies, amyloid \u03b2 immunotherapy has been extensively investigated in Alzheimer's disease, followed by similar studies of \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid \u03b2 monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Thus, it is expected that further refinement of immunotherapy against neurodegenerative diseases may lead to increasing efficacy. Meanwhile, type II diabetes mellitus has been associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction and abnormalities surrounding insulin signaling may underlie disease progression. Naturally, \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy has emerged as a novel paradigm in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, incretin agonists, which stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, reduce dopaminergic neuronal loss and suppress Parkinson's disease disease progression in clinical trials. Similar studies are ongoing also in Alzheimer's disease. This paper focuses on critical issues in \"immunotherapy\" and \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy in relation to therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative disease, and more importantly, how they might merge mechanistically at the point of suppression of protein aggregation, raising the possibility that combined immunotherapy and \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy may be superior to either monotherapy.",

The current pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques. Antibody therapy of Tau and Amyloid beta, vaccines and other methods to decrease Tau and or Amyloid have not been successful after considerable pharmaceutical and biotech efforts. For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance. Recently, a report on animal models using photomodulation with near infrared light to treat AD pathology in K369I tau transgenic model (K3) l engineered to develop neurofibrillary tangles, and the APPs/PSEN1dE9 transgenic model (APP/PS1) to develop amyloid plaques.

It has been problematic to use conjugated peptides with Th1/Th2 adjuvants to induce immune responses against conformational epitopes formed by A\u03b2 oligomers, which is critical to induce protective antibodies. Hence, vaccination should mimic natural immunity by using whole or if possible conjugated antigens, but biasing the response to Th2 with anti-inflammatory adjuvants. Also, selection of the carrier and cross-linking agents is important to prevent suppression of the immune response against the antigen. That certain compounds having phosphorylcholine or fucose induce a sole Th2 immunity would allow antigens with T-cell epitopes without inflammatory autoimmune reactions to be used. Another immunization method is DNA vaccines combined with antigenic ones, which favors the clonal selection and expansion of high affinity antibodies needed for immune protection, but this also requires Th2 immunity. Since AD transgenic mouse models have limited value for immunogen selection as shown by the clinical studies, screening may require the use of validated antibodies and biophysical methods to identify the antigens that would be most likely recognized by the human immune system and thus capable to stimulate a protective antibody response. To induce an anti-Alzheimer's disease protective immunity and prevent possible damage triggered by antigens having B-cell epitopes-only, whole antigens might be used; while inducing Th2 immunity with sole anti-inflammatory fucose-based adjuvants. This approach would avert a damaging systemic inflammatory immunity and the suppression of immunoresponse against the antigen because of carrier and cross-linkers; immune requirements that extend to DNA vaccines.",

Gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal Sepsis. The resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. The major reason for emerging resistance against antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. We have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of neonatal sepsis. A total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. Culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against different antibiotics. Data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. Out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%) cases.

The MEFV gene was described in 1997 as the gene responsible for FMF and is inherited in autosomal recessive manner. It encodes mutated protein pyrin, an important player in the innate immune system and the component of inflammasome which leads to exaggerated inflammatory response through uncontrolled production of interleukin-1. The recent progress in molecular genetics and understanding of pathogenesis showed a more complicated picture of FMF inheritance, penetrance, and pathogenesis. The pathogenesis is not completely understood although the gene responsible for FMF has been identified. Whether the pyrin mutation effect in FMF is due to a loss of function or a gain of function is still controversial. The diagnosis is mainly clinical and the genetic testing is indicated to support it. Colchicine remains the mainstay of treatment of FMF since 1972. It decreases the attacks, improves quality of life, and prevents amyloidosis. The recent advances in genetic testing and molecular studies has led to the development of new therapies of interleukin-1 inhibitors; anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept.",

Hence, various diseases were reported to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) or carriers of MEFV mutations. However, systematic evaluation of all associated diseases in children with FMF has not been done previously. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and type of FMF-associated diseases in children. Files of FMF patients who had been seen in two reference hospitals in Ankara, in the last two years, were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with FMF and concomitant diseases were included to the study. Among 600 FMF patients, 77 were found to have a concomitant disease (12.8%). Thirty patients (5%) had vasculitis; 21 (3.5%) had juvenile idiopathic artritis (JIA); 7 (1.16%) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 19 had other diseases including 5 patients with isolated sacroiliitis. Overall, 13 (2.17%) patients had sacroiliitis in our cohort. The most frequent mutation was M694V/M694V (44%) and 81% of the patients had at least one M694V mutation. Majority of the patients (74%) developed associated diseases while they were not receiving colchicine therapy. Certain inflammatory diseases including vasculitis, chronic arthritis and IBD were more frequently detected in patients with FMF during childhood. M694V mutation is a susceptibility factor for associated diseases. In countries where FMF is prevalent, clinicians dealing with FMF and other inflammatory diseases should be aware of these associations.",

Pyrin modulates the susceptibility to apoptosis via its PYD domain, but how the mutated versions of pyrin affect apoptotic processes are poorly understood. Spontaneous and induced rates of systemic neutrophil apoptosis as well as the levels of proteins involved in apoptosis were investigated ex vivo in patients with FMF using flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. The freshly collected neutrophils from the patients in FMF remission displayed a significantly larger number of cells spontaneously entering apoptosis compared to control (6.27 \u00b1 2.14 vs. 1.69 \u00b1 0.18%). This elevated ratio was retained after 24 h incubation of neutrophils in the growth medium (32.4 \u00b1 7.41 vs. 7.65 \u00b1 1.32%). Correspondingly, the mRNA level for caspase-3 was also significantly increased under these conditions. In response to the inducing agents, the neutrophils from FMF patients also displayed significantly elevated apoptotic rates compared to control. The elevated rates, however, can be largely explained by the higher basal ratio of apoptotic cells in the former group. Monitoring of several proteins involved in apoptosis has not revealed any conventional mechanisms contributing to the enhanced apoptotic rate of neutrophils in FMF. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of accelerated neutrophil apoptosis in FMF remain unknown, it may provide a protection against excessive inflammation and tissue damage due to a massive infiltration of neutrophils in the acute period of the disease.",

Freshly isolated monocytes from 21 patients with FMF (12 homozygous and 9 heterozygous), 14 MEFV healthy carriers and 30 healthy donors (HDs), unstimulated or after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation, were analysed for redox state (production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant responses) and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) secretion. NLRP3 down-modulation was induced by in vitro silencing of the NLRP3 gene. LPS-stimulated monocytes from patients with FMF displayed enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion, which correlated with number and penetrance of MEFV mutations. Silencing of NLRP3 consistently inhibited IL-1\u03b2 secretion. As in other autoinflammatory diseases, FMF monocytes produced more ROS than genetically negative cells from HDs. Unlike in cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes (CAPS), however, they were characterised by a conserved and sustained antioxidant response. Consistent with this finding, activated MEFV-mutated monocytes did not exhibit the functional indicators of oxidative stress observed in CAPS, including accelerated IL-1\u03b2 secretion and deficient production of IL-1Ra. MEFV-mutated monocytes display enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion, which correlates with number of high-penetrance mutations and level of endogenous ROS. Unlike NLRP3-mutated cells, monocytes carrying MEFV mutations withstand oxidative stress and preserve IL-1Ra production, thereby limiting inflammation. Finally, in contrast with that found in the animal model, the increased secretion of IL-1\u03b2 by LPS-stimulated FMF monocytes is NLRP3-dependent.",

Patients with FMF have symptoms such as recurrent fever and abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by arthralgia. Biopsy specimens have revealed substantial neutrophil infiltration into synovia. FMF patients have a mutation in the Mediterranean fever gene, encoding pyrin, which is known to regulate the inflammasome, a platform for processing interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. FMF patients heterozygous for E148Q mutation, heterozygous for M694I mutation, or combined heterozygous for E148Q and M694I mutations, which were found to be major mutations in an FMF study group in Japan, suffer from arthritis, the severity of which is likely to be lower than in FMF patients with M694V mutations. Expression plasmids of wild-type (WT) pyrin and mutated pyrin, such as E148Q, M694I, M694V, and E148Q+M694I, were constructed, and SW982 synovial sarcoma cells were transfected with these expression plasmids. IL-8 and IL-6 were spontaneously secreted from the culture supernatant of SW982 cells without any stimulation, whereas IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 could not be detected even when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Notably, two inflammasome components, ASC and caspase-1, could not be detected in SW982 cells by Western blotting. IL-8 but not IL-6 secretion from SW982 cells was largely suppressed by WT pyrin, but less suppressed by mutated pyrin, which appeared to become weaker in the order of E148Q, M694I, E148Q+M694I, and M694V mutations. As for IL-8 and IL-6, similar results were obtained using stable THP-1 cells expressing the WT pyrin or mutated pyrins, such as M694V or E148Q, when stimulated by LPS. In addition, IL-8 secretion from mononuclear cells of FMF patients was significantly higher than that of healthy volunteers when incubated on a culture plate. Thus, our results suggest that IL-8 secretion from SW982 synovial sarcoma cells suppressed by pyrin independently of inflammasome is affected by pyrin mutations, which may reflect the activity in FMF arthritis.",

Ninety-one patients diagnosed with early CHD enrolled into group one (men &lt; 45 years of age, women &lt; 40 years of age), 106 patients with CHD (men &gt; 50 years of age) to group two and 119 healthy controls enrolled into group three. None of patients was diagnosed with FMF. The diagnosis of CHD was established on electrocardiographic changes, echocardiography and coronary angiography. Thirty-eight patients (41.8%) with early CHD, 17 patients (16%) with CHD and 24 healthy controls (20.2%) carried at least one mutated MEFV allele. Young patients with CHD have different risk factor profiles, clinical presentations and prognoses than older patients. Young patients with CHD usually have multiple risk factors.

The observation of many heterozygous patients in whom a second mutated allele was excluded led to the proposal that heterozygosity could be causal. However, heterozygosity might be coincidental in many patients due to the very high rate of mutations in Mediterranean populations. To better delineate the pathogenicity of heterozygosity in order to improve genetic counselling and disease management. Complementary statistical approaches were used: estimation of FMF prevalence at population levels, genotype comparison in siblings from 63 familial forms, and genotype study in 557 patients from four Mediterranean populations. At the population level, we did not observe any contribution of heterozygosity to disease prevalence. In affected siblings of patients carrying two MEFV mutations, 92% carry two mutated alleles, whereas 4% are heterozygous with typical FMF diagnosis. We demonstrated statistically that patients are more likely to be heterozygous than healthy individuals, as shown by the higher ratio heterozygous carriers/non carriers in patients (p&lt;10(-7)-p&lt;0.003). The risk for heterozygotes to develop FMF was estimated between 2.1 \u00d7 10(-3) and 5.8 \u00d7 10(-3) and the relative risk, as compared to non carriers, between 6.3 and 8.1. This is the first statistical demonstration that heterozygosity is not responsible for classical Mendelian FMF per se, but constitutes a susceptibility factor for clinically-similar multifactorial forms of the disease.

DNA sequencing showed that Y9COL1A1 gene exons 33_34 has lost a C base (c.2321delC), which resulted in a frameshift mutation and caused an premature termination codon (UAA) at amino acid 334, i.e., p.Pro774LeufsX334 The father and grandfather of the proband, both suffered from OI, were verified to be heterozygous for the same mutation. The same mutation was not found in 50 normal controls. Database search confirmed this to be a novel mutation. Pedigree analysis suggested that it has an autosomal dominant inheritance. The proband and patients from the family were clinically diagnosed as OI type I. The study has identified a novel mutation of COL1A1 gene, c.2321delC. This frameshift mutation has caused a premature stop codon and reduced collagen type synthesis, characterized by a lighter OI clinical phenotype.",

However, these findings have been mostly restricted to Western populations. The proportion of mutations and the correlations between genotype and phenotype in Chinese patients with OI are completely unknown. In this study, mutation analyses were performed for COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, and LEPRE1 in a cohort of 58 unrelated Chinese patients with OI; the relationship between collagen type I mutations and clinical features was examined. A total of 56 heterozygous mutations were identified in COL1A1 and COL1A2, including 43 mutations in COL1A1 and 13 mutations in COL1A2. Among the 56 causative COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations, 24 novel mutations were found, and 25 (44.6%) resulted in the substitution of a glycine within the Gly-X-Y triplet domain of the triple helix. Compared with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency (n = 23), patients with mutations affecting glycine residues had a severe skeletal phenotype. In patients 18 years of age or older, on average patients with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency were taller and had higher femoral neck bone mineral density than with patients with helical mutations. Interestingly, we found two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the LEPRE1 gene in two unrelated families with autosomal recessive OI. Although the genotype-phenotype correlation is still unclear, our findings are useful to understand the genetic basis of Chinese patients with OI.",

Dermal fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of type I collagen, suggesting that the OI type I phenotype results from a variety of mutations which alter the apparent expression of either COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes encoding the chains of type I collagen. Short-pulse labeling of dermal fibroblasts with [3H]proline from affected individuals in 19 families indicates that most have alterations in the expected 2:1 synthetic ratio of pro alpha 1(I): pro alpha 2(I), with most having decreased production of pro alpha 1(I). Ratios of COL1A1:COL1A2 mRNA from these individuals, using slot-blot hybridization, indicate that they fall into different groups, but that most have decreased COL1A1 mRNA levels, compared with controls. These data suggest that most of our OI I families have COL1A1 mutations. Copy number and size of the COL1A1 gene by restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA from affected individuals are normal in the families examined. We have identified one 3 generation family in which all affected members have one normal COL1A1 allele and another with a 5 base-pair deletion near the 3' end of the gene. The deletion creates a shift in the translational reading-frame and predicts the synthesis of an elongated pro alpha 1(I) chain. In a second family, a father and a son have a single exon deletion that results from a splicing mutation. Chemical cleavage analysis of amplified cDNA from affected individuals in different regions of the COL1A1 gene, including the promoter, suggests that several individuals have point mutations within the coding region of the gene, while one individual may have a small deletion within the alpha 1(I) carboxyl-terminal propeptide region. Our data provide evidence for significant molecular heterogeneity within the OI type I phenotype and indicate that a variety of mutations can result in decreased synthesis of type I collagen.",

The diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta usually depends on family history and clinical presentation characterized by a fracture (or fractures) during the prenatal period, at birth or in early childhood; genetic tests can confirm diagnosis. Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by dominant autosomal mutations in the type I collagen coding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in about 85% of individuals, affecting collagen quantity or structure. In the past decade, (mostly) recessive, dominant and X-linked defects in a wide variety of genes encoding proteins involved in type I collagen synthesis, processing, secretion and post-translational modification, as well as in proteins that regulate the differentiation and activity of bone-forming cells have been shown to cause osteogenesis imperfecta. The large number of causative genes has complicated the classic classification of the disease, and although a new genetic classification system is widely used, it is still debated. Phenotypic manifestations in many organs, in addition to bone, are reported, such as abnormalities in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, skin fragility, muscle weakness, hearing loss and dentinogenesis imperfecta.

In this cohort study, 128 unrelated individuals with OI were included. Panoramic radiographs were analyzed regarding dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) and congenitally missing teeth. The collagen I genes were sequenced in all individuals, and in 25, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed. Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes were found in 104 of 128 individuals. Tooth agenesis was diagnosed in 17% (hypodontia 11%, oligodontia 6%) and was more frequent in those with DGI (P = 0.016), and in those with OI type III, 47%, compared to those with OI types I, 12% (P = 0.003), and IV, 13% (P = 0.017). Seventy-five percent of the individuals with oligodontia (\u22656 missing teeth) had qualitative mutations, but there was no association with OI type, gender, or presence of DGI. The prevalence of tooth agenesis is high (17%) in individuals with OI, and OI caused by a qualitative collagen I mutation is associated with oligodontia.",

Autosomal dominant OI is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. Bruck syndrome is a recessive disorder featuring congenital contractures in addition to bone fragility; Bruck syndrome type 2 is caused by mutations in PLOD2 encoding collagen lysyl hydroxylase, whereas Bruck syndrome type 1 has been mapped to chromosome 17, with evidence suggesting region 17p12, but the gene has remained elusive so far. Recently, the molecular spectrum of OI has been expanded with the description of the basis of a unique posttranslational modification of type I procollagen, that is, 3-prolyl-hydroxylation. Three proteins, cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), prolyl-3-hydroxylase-1 (P3H1, encoded by the LEPRE1 gene), and the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin-B (PPIB), form a complex that is required for fibrillar collagen 3-prolyl-hydroxylation, and mutations in each gene have been shown to cause recessive forms of OI. Since then, an additional putative collagen chaperone complex, composed of FKBP10 (also known as FKBP65) and SERPINH1 (also known as HSP47), also has been shown to be mutated in recessive OI. Here we describe five families with OI-like bone fragility in association with congenital contractures who all had FKBP10 mutations. Therefore, we conclude that FKBP10 mutations are a cause of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta and Bruck syndrome, possibly Bruck syndrome Type 1 since the location on chromosome 17 has not been definitely localized.",

Ten of the 28 variants are located in COL1A1, five in COL1A2, three in BMP1, three in FKBP10, two in TMEM38B, two in P3H1, and one each in CRTAP, SERPINF1, and SERPINH1. The absence of disease-causing variants in the remaining eight probands suggests further genetic heterogeneity in OI. In general, most OI patients (90%) harbor mainly variants in type I collagen resulting in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. However, in our cohort almost 61% (25/41) were affected with autosomal recessive OI. Moreover, we document a 21-kb genomic deletion in the TMEM38B gene identified in 29% (12/41) of the tested probands, making it the most frequent OI-causing variant in the Palestinian population.

OI type V has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and is not caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2. The most remarkable and pathognomonic feature, observed in ~65% of affected individuals, is a predisposition to develop hyperplastic callus after fractures or surgical interventions. To identify the molecular cause of OI type V, we performed whole-exome sequencing in a female with OI type V and her unaffected parents and searched for de novo mutations. We found a heterozygous de novo mutation in the 5'-untranslated region of IFITM5 (the gene encoding Interferon induced transmembrane protein 5), 14 bp upstream of the annotated translation initiation codon (c.-14C&gt;T). Subsequently, we identified an identical heterozygous de novo mutation in a second individual with OI type V by Sanger sequencing, thereby confirming that this is the causal mutation for the phenotype. IFITM5 is a protein that is highly enriched in osteoblasts and has a putative function in bone formation and osteoblast maturation. The mutation c.-14C&gt;T introduces an upstream start codon that is in frame with the reference open-reading frame of IFITM5 and is embedded into a stronger Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation than the annotated start codon. In vitro, eukaryotic cells were able to recognize this start codon, and they used it instead of the reference translation initiation signal. This suggests that five amino acids (Met-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro) are added to the N terminus and alter IFITM5 function in individuals with the mutation.",

The frequency of the RFLP was 0.38 in Afrikaners, but much lower in indigenous Southern African populations, which suggests that it is of European origin. The polymorphism was used to study 19 affected and non-affected individuals in a four generation family with the autosomal dominant disorder, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I. Co-inheritance of the loss of the RsaI site and the OI phenotype was observed with a lod score of 3.91 at a recombination fraction (theta) of zero, indicating strong linkage. This suggests that the defect in this family is caused by a structural mutation within or close to the pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene. The use of this high frequency RFLP together with other recently described polymorphisms at this locus will facilitate the analysis of the role of this gene in OI and other inherited disorders of connective tissue.",

These mutations occurred at CpG dinucleotides, in a manner consistent with deamination of a methylated cytosine residue, and raise the possibility that CpG dinucleotides are common sites of recurrent mutations in collagen genes.

Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have shown that the vast majority of affected individuals have mutations in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes that encode the chains of type I procollagen. OI is associated with a wide spectrum of phenotypes varying from mild to severe and lethal conditions. The mild forms are usually caused by mutations which inactivate one allele of COL1A1 gene and result in a reduced amount of normal type I collagen, while the severe and lethal forms result from dominant negative mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 which produce structural defects in the collagen molecule. The most common mutations are substitutions of glycine residues, which are crucial to formation and function of the collagen triple helix, by larger amino acids. Although type I collagen is the major structural protein of both bone and skin, the mutations in type I collagen genes cause a bone disease. Some reports showed that the mutant collagen can be expressed differently in bone and in skin. Since most mutations identified in OI are dominant negative, the gene therapy requires a fundamentally different approach from that used for genetic-recessive disorders. The antisense therapy, by reducing the expression of mutant genes, is able to change a structural mutation into a null mutation, and thus convert severe forms of the disease into mild OI type I.",

The mutation rates of G&gt;C at base 128 in intron 31 of the COL1A1 gene and G&gt;A at base 162 in intron 30 of the COL1A2 gene were higher than normal.

We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in which 111 patients with Beh\u00e7et's syndrome who had two or more oral ulcers were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of apremilast twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. This regimen was followed by a 12-week extension phase in which the placebo group was switched to apremilast and a 28-day post-treatment observational follow-up phase. The patients and clinicians were unaware of the study assignments throughout the trial. The primary end point was the number of oral ulcers at week 12. Secondary outcomes included pain from these ulcers (measured on a 100-mm visual-analogue scale, with higher scores indicating worse pain), the number of genital ulcers, overall disease activity, and quality of life. The mean (\u00b1SD) number of oral ulcers per patient at week 12 was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the placebo group (0.5\u00b11.0 vs. 2.1\u00b12.6) (P&lt;0.001).

The relationship between HLA-B51 and Beh\u00e7et's was re-emphasised and a functional role affecting cellular cytotoxicity was proposed. Innate immunity was explored and TLR7 copy number variations and nucleic acid sensors of varying inflammasome pathways were studied. Vascular relapse risk is decreased when BS patients are treated with immunosuppressives with or without anti-coagulation rather than anti-coagulation alone. Although rare in the Far East, the clinical picture of the vascular involvement was quite similar to the previously published reports. Interestingly a female predominance among those with cerebral vein thrombosis was noted. Venous claudication is a frequent and severe symptom among BS patients with lower extremity DVT. Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with BS is usually associated with IVC thrombosis. Silent cases exist and have a better prognosis. The mortality rate among the patients symptomatic for liver disease remains high. Methotrexate seems to be effective in the treatment of chronic progressive neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease. Renal involvement is an uncommon disorder in BS. Suicidal thoughts are increased among BS patients with severe organ involvement. Work-related disability in BS is high and under-appreciated.

In March 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved apremilast for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. The properties of apremilast were evaluated to determine its specificity, effects on intracellular signaling, gene and protein expression, and in vivo pharmacology using models of innate and adaptive immunity. Apremilast inhibited PDE4 isoforms from all four sub-families (A1A, B1, B2, C1, and D2), with IC50 values in the range of 10 to 100 nM. Apremilast did not significantly inhibit other PDEs, kinases, enzymes, or receptors. While both apremilast and thalidomide share a phthalimide ring structure, apremilast lacks the glutarimide ring and thus fails to bind to cereblon, the target of thalidomide action. In monocytes and T cells, apremilast elevated intracellular cAMP and induced phosphorylation of the protein kinase A substrates CREB and activating transcription factor-1 while inhibiting NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, resulting in both up- and down-regulation of several genes induced via TLR4. Apremilast reduced interferon-\u03b1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and inhibited T-cell cytokine production, but had little effect on B-cell immunoglobulin secretion. In a transgenic T-cell and B-cell transfer murine model, apremilast (5mg/kg/day p.o.) did not affect clonal expansion of either T or B cells and had little or no effect on their expression of activation markers. The effect of apremilast on innate immunity was tested in the ferret lung neutrophilia model, which allows monitoring of the known PDE4 inhibitor gastrointestinal side effects (nausea and vomiting). Apremilast significantly inhibited lung neutrophilia at 1mg/kg, but did not induce significant emetic reflexes at doses &lt;30 mg/kg. Overall, the pharmacological effects of apremilast are consistent with those of a targeted PDE4 inhibitor, with selective effects on innate immune responses and a wide therapeutic index compared to its gastrointestinal side effects.",

Chromatin loops form and relax, RNA transcripts and transcription factors move diffusively, and nuclear bodies move. We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. Small speckles move in a directed way toward larger speckles with which they fuse. This directed movement is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels or inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. The random movement of speckles is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels, moderately reduced after inhibition of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and modestly increased upon inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. To define the paths through which speckles can translocate in the nucleus, we generated a pressure gradient to create flows in the nucleus. In response to the pressure gradient, speckles moved along curvilinear paths in the nucleus. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new type of ATP-dependent motion in the nucleus. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces.",

The fusion proteins display identical localization patterns and RNA binding specificities to the endogenous NHPX. Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles. Only newly expressed NHPX accumulated in speckles, and the nucleolar pool of NHPX did not interchange with the pool in speckles, consistent with a unidirectional pathway. The transient accumulation of NHPX in speckles prior to nucleoli was observed in multiple cell lines, including primary cells that lack CBs. Inhibitor studies indicated that progression of newly expressed NHPX from speckles to nucleoli was dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription, but not on RNA polymerase I activity. The data show a specific temporal pathway involving the sequential and directed accumulation of NHPX in distinct subnuclear compartments, and define a novel mechanism for nucleolar localization.",

RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckles. Using ultrathin cryosections to improve optical resolution and preserve nuclear structure, we find that all forms of polymerase II are present, but not enriched, within speckles. Inhibition of polymerase activity shows that speckles do not act as major storage sites for inactive polymerase II complexes but that they contain a stable pool of polymerase II phosphorylated on serine(2) residues of the C-terminal domain, which is transcriptionally inactive and may have roles in spliceosome assembly or posttranscriptional splicing of pre-mRNAs. Paraspeckle domains lie adjacent to speckles, but little is known about their protein content or putative roles in the expression of the speckle-associated genes.

This transition occurred within 15-20 min in Arabidopsis culture cells and seedling root cells, but took more than 2 h in tobacco BY-2 culture cells. Inhibition of respiration, transcription or phosphorylation in cells and ethanol treatment had similar effects to hypoxia.

The basis of this distribution pattern was suggested by the targeting of tagged RBM6 in the giant nuclei (or germinal vesicles (GVs)) of Xenopus oocytes. In spread preparations of GV contents RBM6 was localized both to lampbrush chromosomes and to the surface of many oocyte IGCs, where it was confined to up to 50 discrete patches. Each patch of RBM6 labelling corresponded to a bead-like structure of 0.5-1 microm diameter that assembled de novo on the IGC surface. Assembly of these novel structures depended on the repetitive N-terminal region of RBM6, which acts as a multimerization domain. Without this domain, RBM6 was no longer excluded from the IGC interior but accumulated homogeneously within it. Assembly of IGC-surface structures in mammalian cell lines also depended on the oligomerization domain of RBM6. Oligomerization of RBM6 also had morphological effects on its other major target in GVs, namely the arrays of nascent transcripts visible in lampbrush chromosome transcription units. The presence of oligomerized RBM6 on many lampbrush loops caused them to appear as dense structures with a spiral morphology that appeared quite unlike normal, extended loops. This distribution pattern suggests a new role for RBM6 in the co-transcriptional packaging or processing of most nascent transcripts.",

Addressing miRNAs as drug targets may enable the cure, or at least the treatment of diseases, which presently seems impossible. However, due to miRNAs' chemical structure, generation of potential drug molecules with necessary pharmacokinetic properties is still challenging and requires a re-thinking of the drug discovery process. Therefore, this chapter highlights the potential of miRNAs as drug targets, discusses the challenges, and tries to give a complete overview of recent strategies in miRNA drug discovery.",

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is dependent on the presence of miRNA(microRNA)-122. Miravirsen, a locked-nucleic acid oligonucleotide, sequesters miR-122 and inhibits HCV replication. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of delivering miravirsen during NEVLP to inhibit miR-122 function in a pig LT model. Pig livers were treated with miravirsen during NEVLP or cold storage (CS). Miravirsen absorption, miR-122 sequestration, and miR-122 target gene derepression were determined before and after LT. The effect of miravirsen treatment on HCV infection of hepatoma cells was also assessed. NEVLP improved miravirsen uptake versus CS. Significant miR-122 sequestration and miR-122 target gene derepression were seen with NEVLP but not with CS. In vitro data confirmed miravirsen suppression of HCV replication after established infection and prevented HCV infection with pretreatment of cells, analogous to the pretreatment of grafts in the transplant setting. In conclusion, miravirsen delivery during NEVLP is a potential strategy to prevent HCV reinfection after LT. This is the first large-animal study to provide \"proof of concept\" for using NEVLP to modify and optimize liver grafts for transplantation.",

MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated using a bivariate random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for key signs and symptoms. Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Tonsillar exudate had the highest LR+ for both GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis (1.53 versus 1.71). The confidence intervals of sensitivity, LR+, LR-, and DOR for all signs, symptoms, and the Centor score between two groups overlapped, with the relative difference between sensitivities within 15% for arthralgia or myalgia, fever, injected throat, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar exudate. Larger differences in sensitivities were observed for sore throat, cervical adenopathy, and lack of a cough, although the difference for lack of a cough largely due to a single outlier. Signs and symptoms of patients with GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis are generally similar. No signs or symptoms clearly distinguish GAS from non-GAS infection.

A sore throat test-and-treat service was introduced in 35 community pharmacies across two localities in England during 2014-15. Trained pharmacy staff assessed patients presenting with a sore throat using the Centor scoring system and patients meeting three or all four of the criteria were offered a throat swab test for Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococci. Patients with a positive throat swab test were offered antibiotic treatment. Following screening by pharmacy staff, 149/367 (40.6%) patients were eligible for throat swab testing. Of these, only 36/149 (24.2%) were positive for group A streptococci. Antibiotics were supplied to 9.8% (n = 36/367) of all patients accessing the service. Just under half of patients that were not showing signs of a bacterial infection (60/123, 48.8%) would have gone to their general practitioner if the service had not been available. This study has shown that it is feasible to deliver a community-pharmacy-based screening and treatment service using point-of-care testing. This type of service has the potential to support the antimicrobial resistance agenda by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and inappropriate antibiotic consumption.",

A study to determine if addition of palatal petechiae to Centor criteria adds more value for clinical diagnosis of acute strep pharyngitis in children. Hypothesis. In children, Centor Criteria does not cover all the symptoms and signs of acute strep pharyngitis. We hypothesize that addition of palatal petechiae to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. Methods. One hundred patients with a complaint of sore throat were enrolled in the study. All the patients were examined clinically using the Centor Criteria. They were also examined for other signs and symptoms like petechial lesions over the palate, abdominal pain, and skin rash. All the patients were given rapid strep tests, and throat cultures were sent. No antibiotics were given until culture results were obtained. Results. The sample size was 100 patients. All 100 had fever, sore throat, and erythema of tonsils. Twenty of the 100 patients had tonsillar exudates, 85/100 had tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, and 86/100 had no cough. In total, 9 out of the 100 patients had positive throat cultures. We observed that petechiae over the palate, a very significant sign, is not included in the Centor Criteria. Palatal petechiae were present in 8 out of the 100 patients. Six out of these 8 with palatal petechiae had positive throat culture for strep (75%). Only 7 out of 20 with exudates had positive strep culture. Sixteen out of the 100 patients had rapid strep test positive. Those 84/100 who had negative rapid strep also had negative throat culture. Statistics. We used Fisher's exact test, comparing throat culture positive and negative versus presence of exudates and palatal hemorrhages with positive and negative throat cultures and the resultant P value &lt;.0001.

Little is known about how the pharmacists identify patients with bacterial pharyngitis. Objective To ascertain the appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among Thai community pharmacists according to the Centor criteria and to identify factors related to antibiotic dispensing. Setting 1040 Thai community pharmacists. Method A cross-sectional survey of community pharmacists was conducted in November 2012 to March 2013. The self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 57 % of community pharmacists in the south of Thailand (n = 1040). The survey included questions on diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs regarding antibiotic dispensing. Main outcome measure The appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis according to the original and modified Centor criteria and determinants of antibiotic dispensing including demographic characteristics of pharmacists, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs on antibiotic dispensing. Results Approximately 68 % completed the questionnaires (n = 703). Compared to the pharmacists who reported not dispensing antibiotics in the hypothetical case with common cold, those reported dispensing antibiotics were more likely to consider the following conditions-presence of cough, mild sore throat and patients with age &gt;60 years as cues for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis (p &lt; 0.05). The use of fewer scores of the clinical prediction rules for diagnosis was observed in antibiotic dispensers, compared to who did not do so (p &lt; 0.005). Antibiotic dispensing was positively associated with period of dispensing experience (&gt;5 years) [odds ratio (OR) 1.52; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.23], belief that antibiotics could shorten duration of pharyngitis (OR 1.48; 95 % CI 1.11-1.99), belief that antibiotics could prevent the complications (OR 1.44; 95 % CI 1.09-1.91) and belief that dispensing antibiotics could satisfy the patients (OR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.01-1.71). Nonetheless, antibiotic dispensing was negatively associated with knowledge about pharyngitis (OR 0.83; 95 % CI 0.75-0.93). Conclusion Pharmacists who are knowledgeable on the Centor criteria are more likely to appropriately diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis and less likely to dispense antibiotics in such case.",

This phase IV study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study with non-inferiority design regarding the therapeutic use of penicillin V with two parallel groups. The overall aim is to study if the total exposure with penicillin V can be reduced from 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days to 800 mg four times daily for 5 days when treating Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A) pharyngotonsillitis. Patients will be recruited from 17 primary health care centers in Sweden. Adult men and women, youth and children \u22656 years of age who consult for sore throat and is judged to have a pharyngotonsillitis, with 3-4 Centor criteria and a positive rapid test for group A streptococci, will be included in the study. The primary outcome is clinical cure 5-7 days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. Follow-up controls will be done by telephone after 1 and 3 months. Throat symptoms, potential relapses and complications will be monitored, as well as adverse events. Patients (n = 432) will be included during 2 years. In the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance and the shortage of new antimicrobial agents it is necessary to revisit optimal usage of old antibiotics. Old antimicrobial drugs are often associated with inadequate knowledge on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and lack of optimized dosing regimens based on randomized controlled clinical trials. If a shorter and more potent treatment regimen is shown to be equivalent with the normal 10 day regimen this can imply great advantages for both patients (adherence, adverse events, resistance) and the community (resistance, drug costs).

Previous studies have shown that the Centor score combined with Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) for Group A Streptococci can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients with sore throat. According to the former Swedish guidelines RADT was recommended with 2-4 Centor criteria present and antibiotics were recommended if the test was positive. C- reactive protein (CRP) was not recommended for sore throats. Inappropriate use of RADT and CRP has been reported in several studies. From a larger project 16 general practitioners (GPs) who stated management of sore throats not according to the guidelines were identified. Half-hour long semi-structured interviews were conducted. The topics were the management of sore throats and the use of near-patient tests. Qualitative content analysis was used. The use of the near-patient test interplayed with the clinical assessment and the perception that all infections caused by bacteria should be treated with antibiotics. The GPs expressed a belief that the clinical picture was sufficient for diagnosis in typical cases. RADT was not believed to be relevant since it detects only one bacterium, while CRP was considered as a reliable numerical measure of bacterial infection. Inappropriate use of near-patient test can partly be understood as remnants of outdated knowledge. When new guidelines are introduced the differences between them and the former need to be discussed more explicitly.",

A similar phenomenon may occur when this test is used in a pediatric population, which may affect the need for culture confirmation of all negative RADT results. To assess the performance of a clinical scoring system and to determine whether RADT spectrum bias is present among children who are evaluated for GABHS pharyngitis. Laboratory and clinical records for a consecutive series of pediatric patients who underwent RADT at the Marshfield Clinic between January 2002 and March 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified according to the number of clinical features present by using modified Centor criteria, ie, history of fever, absence of cough, presence of pharyngeal exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The sensitivity of the RADT was defined as the number of patients with positive RADT results divided by the number of patients with either positive RADT results or negative RADT results but positive throat culture results. RADT results were positive for 117 of 561 children (21%), and culture results were positive for 35 of 444 children (8%) with negative RADT results. The overall prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 27% (95% confidence interval: 23-31%). The prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 18% among patients with 0 Centor criteria, 16% among those with 1 criterion, 32% among those with 2 criteria, and 50% among those with 3 or 4 criteria.

The sensitivity of RADT for GABHS pharyngitis is not a fixed value but varies with the severity of disease.

In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.",

Antibiotic frequency was correctly prescribed in 100% of patients. We introduced interventions that included oral and poster presentations to multidisciplinary team, dissemination of guidelines through internal e-mail and systemic changes to GP electronic patient record system EMIS. This involved creating an automated sore throat template and information page. On re-auditing of 71 patients, after two PDSA cycles, compliance with NICE criteria was 87% with a significant reduction in immediate prescribing (66%). Centor criteria documentation was 42%. Correct antibiotic course length was prescribed in over 30% of cases. Other antibiotic regimen parameters (choice, dose and frequency) were correct in 100% of cases. The initial results demonstrated that significant changes were needed. In particular, reducing the amount of antibiotics prescribed by increasing compliance with NICE criteria and ensuring all parameters of antibiotic prescription were correct. We showed that significant sustainable improvement is achievable through carefully devised automated systemic changes that provides critical information in readily accessible format, and does not solely rely on prescribers' knowledge and initiative. The outcome of these interventions are a decrease in immediate antibiotic prescription, significant increase in Centor criteria documentation and an increase in compliance with the correct course length of antibiotics. All these measures would contribute to reduction in antimicrobial resistance and improvement in patient care in the community.

Patients received enzastaurin as a loading dose of 1125 mg, followed by 500 or 875 mg daily for patients on non-enzyme-inducing or enzyme-inducing antiepileptics, respectively. Patients received bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously biweekly. Clinical evaluations were repeated every 4 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at baseline and every 8 weeks from treatment onset. Phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 levels from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were checked with each MRI. Median overall survival was 7.5 and 12.4 months for glioblastomas and anaplastic glioma cohorts, with median progression-free survivals of 2.0 and 4.4 months, respectively. Of GBM patients, 3/40 (7.5 %) were not evaluable, while 8/37 (22 %) had partial or complete response and 20/37 (54 %) had stable disease for 2+ months. Of the 39 evaluable AG patients, 18 (46 %) had an objective response, and 16 (41 %) had stable disease for 2+ months. The most common grade 3+ toxicities were lymphopenia (15 %), hypophosphatemia (8.8 %) and thrombotic events (7.5 %). Two (2.5 %) GBM patients died suddenly; another death (1.3 %) occurred from intractable seizures. Phosphorylated GSK-3 levels from PBMCs did not correlate with treatment response. A minimally important improvement in health-related quality of life was self-reported in 7-9/24 (29.2-37.5 %). Early response based on Levin criteria was significantly associated with significantly longer progression free survival for glioblastomas. Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy.",

Novel treatment strategies beyond the established standard of care with temozolomide-based radiotherapy are urgently needed. We reviewed the literature on glioblastoma with a focus on phase III trials for pharmacotherapies and/or innovative concepts until December 2015. In the last decade, phase III trials on novel compounds largely failed to introduce efficacious pharmacotherapies beyond temozolomide in glioblastoma. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Promising strategies of pharmacotherapy currently under evaluation represent targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with biomarker-stratified patient populations and immunotherapeutic concepts including checkpoint inhibition and vaccination. The clinical role of the medical device delivering 'tumor-treating fields' in newly diagnosed glioblastoma which prolonged overall survival in a phase III study has remained controversial. After failure of several phase III trials with previously promising agents, improvement of concepts and novel compounds are urgently needed to expand the still limited therapeutic options for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

Antiangiogenic treatment likely achieves a beneficial impact through multiple mechanisms of action. Ultimately, however, alternative proangiogenic signal transduction pathways are activated, leading to the development of resistance, even in tumors that initially respond. The identification of biomarkers or imaging parameters to predict response and to herald resistance is of high priority. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. However, future studies are warranted. Predictive markers may allow appropriate patient enrichment, combination with chemotherapy may ultimately prove successful in improving overall survival, and novel agents targeting multiple proangiogenic pathways may prove effective.",

First enthusiasm was provoked by promising radiological response rates and an apparent clinical benefit with some of these agents. Major limitations include the modest number of durable responses, the lack of cytotoxic antitumor activity, of synergy when combined with chemotherapy and of an overall survival benefit. We review the rationale as well as preclinical and clinical evidence for the future development of antiangiogenic agents in glioblastoma. The most prominent approach targets VEGF and includes agents such as the VEGF antibody bevacizumab, the VEGF receptor fusion protein aflibercept or the tyrosine kinase inhibitors cediranib and XL-184. Inhibition of angiogenic pathways by small molecules, for example, enzastaurin, or anti-integrin-based approaches, for example, cilengitide, represent alternative strategies. Enzastaurin and cediranib failed in randomized Phase III trials in recurrent glioblastoma, aflibercept in Phase II. By contrast, bevacizumab was conditionally approved in many countries. Recently completed Phase III trials for bevacizumab and cilengitide in the first-line setting will define the future role of these agents.

Patients not on EIAED were treated on the phase II portion of the trial with radiographic response and progression-free survival (PFS) as primary objectives. Patients in phase I received enzastaurin 525-900 mg/d. Phase II patients received 500 or 525 mg/d. One hundred and eighteen patients were accrued to this trial.

Subsequently, phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription that relay Janus kinase signalling and transcription of cytokines in the nucleus will be diminished. Key cytokines in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases are targeted by Janus kinase inhibitors.

Tofacitinib, inhibiting signalling via all Janus kinase family members, was effective in phase 2 and 3 trials in moderate-severe ulcerative colitis. GSK2586184, a Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor, induced clinical and endoscopic response in ulcerative colitis; however, the study was discontinued at an early stage due to liver toxicity observed in systemic lupus patients receiving the drug.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Tofacitinib on atherogenic diet (ATD)-induced atherosclerosis using apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Atherosclerosis-prone apoE-/- mice were fed with ATD and treated with or without Tofacitinib through intragastrical administration (10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) for 8 weeks. Our results showed that Tofacitinib did not change plasma lipids, while significantly reduced the levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. It also significantly attenuated atherosclerotic plaque lesion in the aortic root and macrophages contained in plaque as shown with Mac2 immuno-staining. Peritoneal macrophages (PMC) were separated from apoE-/- mice fed with 8-week ATD, and then subjected to inflammation tests. Flow cytometry analysis of F4/80 and CD206 and mRNA levels of M1 and M2 macrophages markers showed that M1 macrophages decreased while M2 macrophages increased in Tofacitinib treated group. Expressions of other inflammatory genes also indicated an anti-inflammatory status in mice treated with Tofacitinib. Ox-LDL was used to induce foam cell formation from PMC in wild type mice, and the results displayed a reduced formation of foam cells and decreased inflammation in mice with Tofacitinib administration (1 \u03bcM).

They are characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, significantly impacting on patient quality of life and often requiring prolonged treatment. Existing therapies for IBD are not effective for all patients, and an unmet need exists for additional therapies to induce and maintain remission. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinib, for the treatment of IBD and the effect of JAK inhibition on the chronic cycle of inflammation that is characteristic of the disease. The pathogenesis of IBD involves a dysfunctional response from the innate and adaptive immune system, resulting in overexpression of multiple inflammatory cytokines, many of which signal through JAKs. Thus JAK inhibition allows multiple cytokine signaling pathways to be targeted and is expected to modulate the innate and adaptive immune response in IBD, thereby interrupting the cycle of inflammation. Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted immunomodulator for IBD. Clinical development of tofacitinib and other JAK inhibitors is ongoing, with the aspiration of providing new treatment options for IBD that have the potential to deliver prolonged efficacy and clinically meaningful patient benefits.",

In the form of a heterodimer, they drive transcription from E-box enhancer elements in the promoters of responsive genes. We have examined abundance, posttranslational modifications, cellular localization of endogenous and ectopically expressed CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins. Nuclear/cytoplasm distribution of CLOCK was found to be under circadian regulation. Analysis of subcellular localization of CLOCK in embryo fibroblasts of mice carrying different germ-line circadian mutations showed that circadian regulation of nuclear accumulation of CLOCK is BMAL1-dependent. Formation of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex following ectopic coexpression of both proteins is followed by their codependent phosphorylation, which is tightly coupled to CLOCK nuclear translocation and degradation. This binding-dependent coregulation is specific for CLOCK/BMAL1 interaction, as no other PAS domain protein that can form a complex with either CLOCK or BMAL1 was able to induce similar effects. Importantly, all posttranslational events described in our study are coupled with active transactivation complex formation, which argues for their significant functional role. Altogether, these results provide evidence for an additional level of circadian system control, which is based on regulation of transcriptional activity or/and availability of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex.",

Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG). The non-canonical E-boxes or E-box-like sequences have also been reported to be necessary for circadian oscillation. We report a new cis-element required for cell-autonomous circadian transcription of clock genes. This new element consists of a canonical E-box or a non-canonical E-box and an E-box-like sequence in tandem with the latter with a short interval, 6 base pairs, between them. We demonstrate that both E-box or E-box-like sequences are needed to generate cell-autonomous oscillation. We also verify that the spacing nucleotides with constant length between these 2 E-elements are crucial for robust oscillation. Furthermore, by in silico analysis we conclude that several clock and clock-controlled genes possess a direct repeat of the E-box-like elements in their promoter region. We propose a novel possible mechanism regulated by double E-box-like elements, not to a single E-box, for circadian transcriptional oscillation. The direct repeat of the E-box-like elements identified in this study is the minimal required element for the generation of cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation of clock and clock-controlled genes.",

Current models posit that CRY is the dominant repressor, while PER may play an accessory role. In this study, however, constitutive expression of PER, and not CRY1, severely disrupted the clock in fibroblasts and liver. Furthermore, constitutive expression of PER2 in the brain and SCN of transgenic mice caused a complete loss of behavioral circadian rhythms in a conditional and reversible manner. These results demonstrate that rhythmic levels of PER2, rather than CRY1, are critical for circadian oscillations in cells and in the intact organism. Our biochemical evidence supports an elegant mechanism for the disparity: PER2 directly and rhythmically binds to CLOCK:BMAL1, while CRY only interacts indirectly; PER2 bridges CRY and CLOCK:BMAL1 to drive the circadian negative feedback loop.",

Here we show that abrogation of CLOCK:BMAL-dependent transcription in zebrafish cells by the dominant negative zCLOCK3-DeltaC does not affect the circadian oscillation of zCry1a. Moreover, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade modulates the circadian expression of zCry1a gene in constant darkness. Taken together, our data strongly support the notion that circadian oscillation of zCry1a is CLOCK:BMAL-independent and further indicate that mechanisms involving non-canonical clock genes could contribute to the circadian expression of zCry1a gene in a cell autonomous manner.",

The clock proteins PER1 and PER2 play essential roles in a negative limb of the feedback loop that generates the circadian rhythm in mammals. In addition, the proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 (also known as ARNTL) form a heterodimer that drives the Per genes via the E-box consensus sequences within their promoter regions. In the present study, we demonstrate that Id2 is involved in stabilization of the amplitudes of the circadian oscillations by suppressing transcriptional activation of clock genes Clock and Bmal1. Id2 shows dynamic oscillation in the SCN, with a peak in the late subjective night. Under constant dark conditions (DD), Id2(-/-) mice showed no apparent difference in locomotor activity, however, under constant light conditions (LL), Id2(-/-) mice exhibit aberrant locomotor activity, with lower circadian oscillation amplitudes, although the free running periods in Id2(-/-) mice show no differences from those in either wild type or heterozygous mice. Id2(-/-) animals also exhibit upregulation of Per1 in constant light, during both the subjective night and day. In wild type mice, Id2 is upregulated by constant light exposure during the subjective night. We propose that Id2 expression in the SCN contributes to maintenance of dynamic circadian oscillations.",

We report here that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of Bmal1-null mutant mice, unexpectedly, generates stochastic oscillations with periods that overlap the circadian range. Dissociated SCN neurons expressed fluctuating levels of PER2 detected by bioluminescence imaging but could not generate circadian oscillations intrinsically. Inhibition of intercellular communication or cyclic-AMP signaling in SCN slices, which provide a positive feed-forward signal to drive the intracellular negative feedback loop, abolished the stochastic oscillations. Propagation of this feed-forward signal between SCN neurons then promotes quasi-circadian oscillations that arise as an emergent property of the SCN network. Experimental analysis and mathematical modeling argue that both intercellular coupling and molecular noise are required for the stochastic rhythms, providing a novel biological example of noise-induced oscillations. The emergence of stochastic circadian oscillations from the SCN network in the absence of cell-autonomous circadian oscillatory function highlights a previously unrecognized level of circadian organization.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11798163": "Transcriptional regulation appears to be fundamental to circadian oscillations of clock gene expression. These oscillations are believed to control output rhythms. The transcriptional feedback loop and a model of interlocked loops have been proposed as the basis for these oscillations. We characterized the genomic structure of the mouse Bmal1 gene (mBmal1) and defined the mBmal1 promoter region. Transcription of mBmal1 was activated by CRY1, CRY2, and PER2, and was repressed by BMAL1-CLOCK dimers. Therefore, CRY, PER2, and BMAL1-CLOCK play bidirectional roles in transcription when they are at high levels by late day and midnight, respectively. This underlies the opposite phase of BMAL1 compared to CRY and PER. We propose that a BMAL1 negative feedback loop interlocks with the CRY and PER2 negative feedback loop by inter-activation, forming a third positive forward loop. This transcriptional model suggests a molecular basis for the maintenance of stability, persistence, and period of circadian rhythms. The transcriptional potency of CRY is predominant within the mammalian clock, suggesting a clearance mechanism for CRY in period maintenance. (c)2002 Elsevier Science (USA).",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28069295": "One of the key issues pertaining to the control of memory is to respond to a consistently changing environment or microbial niche present in it. Human cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor which plays a crucial role in memory has a homolog in C. elegans, crh-1. crh-1 appears to influence memory processes to certain extent by habituation of the host to a particular environment. The discrimination between the pathogen and a non-pathogen is essential for C. elegans in a microbial niche which determines its survival. Training the nematodes in the presence of a virulent pathogen (S. aureus) and an opportunistic pathogen (P. mirabilis) separately exhibits a different behavioural paradigm. This appears to be dependent on the CREB transcription factor. Here we show that C. elegans homolog crh-1 helps in memory response for a short term against the interacting pathogens. Following conditioning of the nematodes to S. aureus and P. mirabilis, the wild type nematodes exhibited a positive response towards the respective pathogens which diminished slowly after 2h. By contrast, the crh-1 deficient nematodes had a defective memory post conditioning. The molecular data reinforces the importance of crh-1 gene in retaining the memory of nematode. Our results also suggest that involvement of neurotransmitters play a crucial role in modulating the memory of the nematode with the assistance of CREB. Therefore, we elucidate that CREB is responsible for the short term memory response in C. elegans against bacterial pathogens.",

Previous studies have shown the importance of several brain regions for social recognition memories; however, the mechanisms underlying the consolidation of social recognition memory at the molecular and anatomic levels remain unknown. Here, we show a brain network necessary for the generation of social recognition memory in mice. A mouse genetic study showed that cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is required for the formation of social recognition memory. Importantly, significant inductions of the CREB target immediate-early genes c-fos and Arc were observed in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 regions), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala (basolateral region) when social recognition memory was generated. Pharmacological experiments using a microinfusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin showed that protein synthesis in these brain regions is required for the consolidation of social recognition memory. These findings suggested that social recognition memory is consolidated through the activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the hippocampus/mPFC/ACC/amygdala. Network analyses suggested that these four brain regions show functional connectivity with other brain regions and, more importantly, that the hippocampus functions as a hub to integrate brain networks and generate social recognition memory, whereas the ACC and amygdala are important for coordinating brain activity when social interaction is initiated by connecting with other brain regions. We have found that a brain network composed of the hippocampus/mPFC/ACC/amygdala is required for the consolidation of social recognition memory.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we identify brain networks composed of multiple brain regions for the consolidation of social recognition memory. We found that social recognition memory is consolidated through CREB-meditated gene expression in the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala. Importantly, network analyses based on c-fos expression suggest that functional connectivity of these four brain regions with other brain regions is increased with time spent in social investigation toward the generation of brain networks to consolidate social recognition memory. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hippocampus functions as a hub to integrate brain networks and generate social recognition memory, whereas ACC and amygdala are important for coordinating brain activity when social interaction is initiated by connecting with other brain regions.",

Ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent protein degradation affects the upstream signaling pathways which regulate CREB activity. However, the molecular mechanisms of proteasome inhibition on reductive CREB activity are still unclear. The current study demonstrated that MG132-inhibited proteasome activity resulted in a dose dependence of CREB dephosphorylation at Ser133 as well as decreased phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B (Tyr1472) and its tyrosine protein kinase Fyn (Tyr416). These dephosphorylations are probably caused by disturbance of expression and post-translational modifications of tau protein since tau siRNA decreased the activity of Fyn, NR2B, and CREB. To further confirm this perspective, HEK293 cells stably expressing human tau441 protein were treated with MG132 and dephosphorylations of CREB and NR2B were observed. The current research provides an alternative pathway, tau/Fyn/NR2B signaling, regulating CREB activity.",

In the present study, we have focused on the early hippocampal memory-related changes in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, a well-established mouse model of familial AD. It is well known that molecules like cAMP response element binding (CREB) and binding protein (CBP) play a crucial role in memory consolidation. We analyzed CBP on its transcriptional activity and protein levels, finding a significant downregulation of both of them at 3-month-old mice. In addition, the downregulation of this molecule was associated with a decrease on acetylation levels of histone H3 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, the p-CREB levels, which are important for memory acquisition at 3 months in APP/PS1 mice, were downregulated. Furthermore, we suggest that early neuroinflammation, especially due to the Tnf\u03b1 gene increased expression, could also be responsible to this process of memory loss. Given all the previously mentioned results, we propose that an early suitable treatment to prevent the evolution of the disease should include a combination of drugs, including anti-inflammatories, which may decrease glial activation and Tnf\u03b1 levels, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors that increase cAMP levels.",

CREB1\u0394 could also be sumoylated by other PIAS family proteins, but not by the E3 ligases RanBP2 and Pc2 or by the E2 ligase Ubc9. Furthermore, water maze training increased the level of endogenous CREB SUMOylation in rat CA1 neurons determined by in vitro SUMOylation assay, but this effect was not observed in other brain areas. Moreover, transduction of Lenti-CREBWT to rat CA1 area facilitated, whereas transduction of Lenti-CREB double sumo-mutant (CREBK271RK290R) impaired, spatial learning and memory performance. Transduction of Lenti-CREBWT-SUMO1 fusion vector to rat CA1 area showed a more significant effect in enhancing spatial learning and memory and CREB SUMOylation. Lenti-CREBWT transduction increased, whereas Lenti-CREBK271RK290R transduction decreased, CREB DNA binding to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) promoter and decreased bdnf mRNA expression. Knock-down of PIAS1 expression in CA1 area by PIAS1 siRNA transfection impaired spatial learning and memory and decreased endogenous CREB SUMOylation. In addition, CREB SUMOylation was CREB phosphorylation dependent and lasted longer. Therefore, CREB phosphorylation may be responsible for signal transduction during the early phase of long-term memory formation, whereas CREB SUMOylation sustains long-term memory.",

The primary outcome was to determine the changes in expression of proinflammatory innate and T-cell-derived cytokines during ustekinumab therapy. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical and histopathologic phenotype in relation to the mRNA expression profile of proinflammatory cytokines. In lesional PRP skin samples from a single patient, upregulated expression levels were found for most proinflammatory innate cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and IL-1\u03b2.

TNF-\u03b1-antagonists and ustekinumab differentially affected lymphocyte counts (+13% and \u00b10%, respectively). Dynamics were pronounced during the first 180 days of treatment. In 340 treatment-years, 15 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) III-IV\u00b0 LAE were recorded (11 involved liver enzymes). They prompted alteration of the biologic regime in only 2 cases. Age, sex, previous systemic treatments, and psoriatic arthritis did not significantly predict LAE. Liver enzyme and triglyceride screening may be warranted in some instances. Our data suggest that unguided monitoring of other routine laboratory parameters is unnecessary under long-term biologic treatment.",

The efficacy of ustekinumab versus placebo in terms of clinical response and remission of induction has been shown in phase3 clinical trials. When used as subcutaneous maintenance therapy, the therapeutic benefit of ustekinumab over placebo has been confirmed in both clinical response and remission in patients who have responded clinically to induction therapy. In addition, ustekinumab has demonstrated an improvement in mucosal healing parameters. The safety profile of the drug has been good, with low infection rates (without reactivation of tuberculosis) and absence of tumour reporting. The development of drug immunogenicity appears to be rare. In summary, ustekinumab is a promising treatment option in patients with Crohn's disease, as an alternative to anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs.",

Approved for use in treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis in 2009, there has been considerable interest in the long-term safety of ustekinumab. This review discusses the use of ustekinumab in the treatment of psoriasis and its potential to be an effective and well-tolerated therapy. A literature search was performed for articles published through April 2013 to identify any safety concerns. Our results indicate that ustekinumab has demonstrated higher efficacy rates as compared to traditional therapies; and with a favorable dosing schedule and stable safety profile, patients with recalcitrant disease will now have another option for treatment.",

Results from subsequent phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown promising data on the clinical efficacy of induction and remission of moderate to severe CD. These data and the safety profile of ustekinumab will be reviewed. Expert commentary: As a significant proportion of individuals with CD have ongoing symptoms and inflammation despite existing therapies, there is a clinical need for new agents like ustekinumab directed at different targets on the inflammatory pathway. Looking forward, more studies are needed to evaluate dosing escalation or de-escalation in addition to timing of therapy switches. In addition, further data is required to gauge the comparative effectiveness of ustekinumab to the biologic agents that are currently used in the treatment of CD.",

However, the high incidence of immune response against the mouse mAb restricted therapeutic utility. Development of chimeric, \"humanized\" and human mAbs broadened therapeutic application to immune-mediated diseases requiring long-term treatment. Indeed, mAb therapeutics targeting soluble cytokines are highly effective in numerous immune-mediated disorders. A recent example is ustekinumab, a first-in-class therapeutic human immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb that binds to the interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23, cytokines that modulate lymphocyte function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets. Ustekinumab was generated via recombinant human IL-12 immunization of human immunoglobulin (hu-Ig) transgenic mice. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with the IL-12 receptor \u03b21 subunit of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes. Ustekinumab is approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and has demonstrated efficacy in Crohn disease and psoriatic arthritis. The clinical characterization of ustekinumab continues to clarify our understanding of human immune pathologies and may offer a novel therapeutic option for certain immune-mediated diseases.",

Given the well-established role of the immuno-mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, in the past few years several key steps in the pathogenesis of this disease have been elucidated and the increased knowledge led to the development of specific drugs, commonly defined as \"biologics\" targeting one or more of these steps. At present an anti-CD11a antibody (efalizumab), an anti-LFA3/CD2 receptor (alefacept) and 3 antitumor necrosis factor alpha agents (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab) are now commercially available for the treatment of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Recent studies have demonstrated that interleukins (IL) 12 and 23 play an important role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis.

In the present study the ability of IL-12 and IL-23 to suppress multiple P450 enzymes was investigated in vitro using six separate lots of cultured human hepatocytes. Following exposure of 10 ng/ml IL-12 and IL-23 for 48 hours, either alone or in combination, no change in CYP2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 gene expression or functional activity was observed. None of the untreated hepatocyte donors showed appreciable expression of the IL-12 or IL-23 receptors. Similar results were seen with whole human liver samples. Exposure of hepatocytes to IL-12 and/or IL-23, known P450 suppressors (IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) or known P450 inducers (\u03b2-naphthoflavone, phenobarbital, and rifampicin) did not appreciably alter the expression of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptors either. Finally, in contrast to the positive control IL-6, expression of the acute phase C-reactive protein was unaltered following IL-12 and/or IL-23 treatment.

To determine whether HLA gene polymorphisms can predict the response to ustekinumab in Chinese patients with psoriasis. Sixty-six patients with psoriasis treated with ustekinumab were included in the study, and the effectiveness of ustekinumab therapy was evaluated at weeks 0, 16 and 28 by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). More HLA-Cw6-positive patients achieved a PASI 75 response at week 4 compared with HLA-Cw6-negative patients (38% vs. 9%, P = 0\u00b7019). Similarly, at week 16, patients carrying the HLA-Cw6 allele showed a higher likelihood of achieving PASI 50, 75 and 90 than Cw6-negative patients, although this was not statistically significant. At week 28, a significantly higher percentage of HLA-Cw6-positive patients maintained PASI 90 response compared with Cw6-negative patients (63% vs. 26%, P = 0\u00b7035). Further analysis of other HLA allele polymorphisms did not show significant associations with therapeutic response to ustekinumab.

As single anticancer agent, tasquinimod treatment was effective in preventing early stage tumor growth, but did not achieve a clear antitumor effect in advanced tumors. Investigations of this response revealed that tasquinimod induces an increase in the expression of a negative regulator of T cell activation, Programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This markedly weakens its antitumor immunity, yet provokes an \"inflamed\" milieu rendering tumors more prone to T cell-mediated immune attack by PD-L1 blockade.

There are 29 Aux/IAA genes in Arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression [3]. Although some studies have suggested that individual Aux/IAA genes have specialized function, genetic analyses of the family have been limited by the scarcity of loss-of-function phenotypes [4]. Furthermore, with a few exceptions, our knowledge of the factors that regulate Aux/IAA expression is limited [1, 5]. We hypothesize that transcriptional control of Aux/IAA genes plays a central role in the establishment of the auxin-signaling pathways that regulate organogenesis, growth, and environmental response. Here, we describe a screen for transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the Aux/IAA genes. We identify TFs from 38 families, including 26 members of the DREB/CBF family. Several DREB/CBF TFs directly promote transcription of the IAA5 and IAA19 genes in response to abiotic stress. Recessive mutations in these IAA genes result in decreased tolerance to stress conditions, demonstrating a role for auxin in abiotic stress. Our results demonstrate that stress pathways interact with the auxin gene regulatory network (GRN) through transcription of the Aux/IAA genes. We propose that the Aux/IAA genes function as hubs that integrate genetic and environmental information to achieve the appropriate developmental or physiological outcome.",

The modulation of auxin responsiveness through the auxin perception and signaling machinery is believed to be a major regulatory mechanism controlling cambium activity and wood formation. To gain more insights into the roles of key Aux/IAA gene regulators of the auxin response in these processes, we identified and characterized members of the Aux/IAA family in the genome of Eucalyptus grandis, a tree of worldwide economic importance. We found that the gene family in Eucalyptus is slightly smaller than that in Populus and Arabidopsis, but all phylogenetic groups are represented. High-throughput expression profiling of different organs and tissues highlighted several Aux/IAA genes expressed in vascular cambium and/or developing xylem, some showing differential expression in response to developmental (juvenile vs. mature) and/or to environmental (tension stress) cues. Based on the expression profiles, we selected a promising candidate gene, EgrIAA4, for functional characterization. We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor. Overexpressing a stabilized version of EgrIAA4 in Arabidopsis dramatically impeded plant growth and fertility and induced auxin-insensitive phenotypes such as inhibition of primary root elongation, lateral root emergence and agravitropism.

Auxin enhances the binding of Aux/IAA proteins to the receptor TIR1, which is an F-box protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(TIR1). Binding of Aux/IAA proteins leads to degradation via the 26S proteasome, but evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins is lacking. Here we used an Arabidopsis cell suspension-based protoplast system to find evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated ubiquitination of the Aux/IAA proteins SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12. Each of these proteins showed a distinct abundance and repressor activity when expressed in this cell system. Moreover, the amount of endogenous TIR1 protein appeared to be rate-limiting for a proper auxin response measured by the co-transfected DR5::GUS reporter construct. Co-transfection with 35S::TIR1 led to auxin-dependent degradation, and excess of 35S::TIR1 even led to degradation of Aux/IAAs in the absence of auxin treatment. Expression of the mutant tir1-1 protein or the related F-box protein COI1, which is involved in jasmonate signaling, had no effect on Aux/IAA degradation. Our results show that SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12 are poly-ubiquitinated and degraded in response to increased auxin or TIR1 levels. In conclusion, our data provide experimental support for the model that SCF(TIR1)-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins marks these proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome, leading to activation of auxin-responsive gene expression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16126837": "Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins are transcriptional regulators that mediate many aspects of plant responses to auxin. While functions of most Aux/IAAs have been defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana, phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations have been scarce and subtle. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. IAA9-inhibited lines have simple leaves instead of wild-type compound leaves, and fruit development is triggered before fertilization, giving rise to parthenocarpy. This indicates that IAA9 is a key mediator of leaf morphogenesis and fruit set. In addition, antisense plants displayed auxin-related growth alterations, including enhanced hypocotyl/stem elongation, increased leaf vascularization, and reduced apical dominance. Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14742873": "Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that repress expression of primary/early auxin response genes in protoplast transfection assays. Repression is thought to result from Aux/IAA proteins dimerizing with auxin response factor (ARF) transcriptional activators that reside on auxin-responsive promoter elements, referred to as AuxREs. Most Aux/IAA proteins contain four conserved domains, designated domains I, II, III, and IV. Domain II and domains III and IV play roles in protein stability and dimerization, respectively. A clear function for domain I had not been established. Results reported here indicate that domain I in Aux/IAA proteins is an active repression domain that is transferable and dominant over activation domains. An LxLxL motif within domain I is important for conferring repression. The dominance of Aux/IAA repression domains over activation domains in ARF transcriptional activators provides a plausible explanation for the repression of auxin response genes via ARF-Aux/IAA dimerization on auxin-responsive promoters.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11752389": "Aux/IAA genes are early auxin response genes that encode short-lived nuclear proteins with four conserved domains, referred to as I, II, III, and IV. Arabidopsis Aux/IAA proteins repressed transcription on auxin-responsive reporter genes in protoplast transfection assays. Mutations in domain II resulted in increased repression, whereas mutations in domains I and III partially relieved repression. Aux/IAA proteins fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain were targeted to promoters of constitutively expressed reporter genes and actively repressed transcription in an auxin-responsive and dose-dependent manner. In comparison with an unfused luciferase protein, luciferase fused to Aux/IAA proteins displayed less luciferase activity, which further decreased in the presence of auxin in transfected protoplasts. Domain II mutations increased and domain I mutations decreased luciferase activity with the fusion proteins. These results suggested that Aux/IAA proteins function as active repressors by dimerizing with auxin response factors bound to auxin response elements and that early auxin response genes are regulated by auxin-modulated stabilities of Aux/IAA proteins.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409484": "The Aux/IAA genes encode a large family of short-lived proteins known to regulate auxin signalling in plants. Functional characterization of SlIAA15, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Aux/IAA family, shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin-dependent transcription. The physiological significance of SlIAA15 was addressed by a reverse genetics approach, revealing that SlIAA15 plays multiple roles in plant developmental processes. The SlIAA15 down-regulated lines display lower trichome number, reduced apical dominance with associated modified pattern of axillary shoot development, increased lateral root formation and decreased fruit set. Moreover, the leaves of SlIAA15-inhibited plants are dark green and thick, with larger pavement cells, longer palisade cells and larger intercellular space of spongy mesophyll cells. The SlIAA15-suppressed plants exhibit a strong reduction in type I, V and VI trichome formation, suggesting that auxin-dependent transcriptional regulation is required for trichome initiation. Concomitant with reduced trichome formation, the expression of some R2R3 MYB genes, putatively involved in the control of trichome differentiation, is altered. These phenotypes uncover novel and specialized roles for Aux/IAAs in plant developmental processes, clearly indicating that members of the Aux/IAA gene family in tomato perform both overlapping and specific functions.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17077182": "The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development. This largely occurs as a consequence of changes in gene expression. The Aux/IAA genes are best characterized among the early auxin-responsive genes, which encode short-lived transcriptional repressors. In most plants examined, including Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice, the Aux/IAA genes constitute a large gene family. By screening the available databases, at least 15 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been identified from wheat (Triticum aestivum), which exhibit high sequence identity with Aux/IAA homologues in other species. One of these Aux/IAA genes, TaIAA1, harbouring all the four conserved domains characteristic of the Aux/IAA proteins, has been characterized in detail. The expression of TaIAA1 is light-sensitive, tissue-specific, and is induced within 15-30 min of exogenous auxin application. Also, the TaIAA1 transcript levels increase in the presence of a divalent cation, Ca(2+), and this effect is reversed by the calcium-chelating agent, EGTA. The TaIAA1 gene qualifies as the primary response gene because an increase in its transcript levels by auxin is unaffected by cycloheximide. In addition to auxin, the TaIAA1 gene is also induced by brassinosteroid, providing evidence that interplay between hormones is crucial for the regulation of plant growth and development.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27049520": "Auxins are the key players in plant growth development involving leaf formation, phototropism, root, fruit and embryo development. Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) are early auxin response genes noted as transcriptional repressors in plant auxin signaling. However, many studies focus on Aux/ARF gene families and much less is known about the Aux/IAA gene family in Brassica rapa (B. rapa). Here we performed a comprehensive genome-wide analysis and identified 55 Aux/IAA genes in B. rapa using four conserved motifs of Aux/IAA family (PF02309). Chromosomal mapping of the B. rapa Aux/IAA (BrIAA) genes facilitated understanding cluster rearrangement of the crucifer building blocks in the genome. Phylogenetic analysis of BrIAA with Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays identified 51 sister pairs including 15 same species (BrIAA-BrIAA) and 36 cross species (BrIAA-AtIAA) IAA genes. Among the 55 BrIAA genes, expression of 43 and 45 genes were verified using Genebank B. rapa ESTs and in home developed microarray data from mature leaves of Chiifu and RcBr lines. Despite their huge morphological difference, tissue specific expression analysis of BrIAA genes between the parental lines Chiifu and RcBr showed that the genes followed a similar pattern of expression during leaf development and a different pattern during bud, flower and siliqua development stages. The response of the BrIAA genes to abiotic and auxin stress at different time intervals revealed their involvement in stress response. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms between IAA genes of reference genome Chiifu and RcBr were focused and identified. Our study examines the scope of conservation and divergence of Aux/IAA genes and their structures in B. rapa. Analyzing the expression and structural variation between two parental lines will significantly contribute to functional genomics of Brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the Aux/IAA genes in B. rapa.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22368074": "Auxin is a central hormone that exerts pleiotropic effects on plant growth including the development of roots, shoots, flowers and fruit. The perception and signaling of the plant hormone auxin rely on the cooperative action of several components, among which auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins play a pivotal role. In this study, we identified and comprehensively analyzed the entire Aux/IAA gene family in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a reference species for Solanaceae plants, and the model plant for fleshy fruit development. Functional characterization using a dedicated single cell system revealed that tomato Aux/IAA proteins function as active repressors of auxin-dependent gene transcription, with, however, different Aux/IAA members displaying varying levels of repression. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Aux/IAA gene family is slightly contracted in tomato compared with Arabidopsis, with a lower representation of non-canonical proteins. Sl-IAA genes display distinctive expression pattern in different tomato organs and tissues, and some of them display differential responses to auxin and ethylene, suggesting that Aux/IAAs may play a role in linking both hormone signaling pathways. The data presented here shed more light on Sl-IAA genes and provides new leads towards the elucidation of their function during plant development and in mediating hormone cross-talk.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16284307": "Auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development. The AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) genes encode short-lived transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN RECEPTOR F-BOX proteins. The Aux/IAA proteins regulate auxin-mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR protein family. Aux/IAA function is poorly understood; herein, we report the identification and characterization of insertion mutants in 12 of the 29 Aux/IAA family members. The mutants show no visible developmental defects compared with the wild type. Double or triple mutants of closely related Aux/IAA genes, such as iaa8-1 iaa9-1 or iaa5-1 iaa6-1 iaa19-1, also exhibit wild-type phenotypes. Global gene expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of auxin-treated and untreated light-grown seedlings are unaffected in the iaa17-6 and iaa5-1 iaa6-1 iaa19-1 mutants. By contrast, similar analysis with the gain-of-function axr3-1/iaa17-1 mutant seedlings reveals dramatic changes in basal and auxin-induced gene expression compared with the wild type. Expression of several type-A ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and degradation is repressed in axr3-1/iaa17-1. The data suggest extensive functional redundancy among Aux/IAA gene family members and that enhanced stability of the AXR3/IAA17 protein severely alters the molecular phenotype, resulting in developmental defects.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145395": "The regulatory interactions between AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs) and Aux/IAA repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction. Yet, the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established. We generated a steroid-inducible ARF5/MONOPTEROS (MP) transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire Aux/IAA family in Arabidopsis thaliana. Target genes of ARF5/MP identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses. Our study shows that ARF5/MP is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one-half of all Aux/IAA genes, and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades. Further, genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple Aux/IAA targets negatively feed back onto ARF5/MP activity. This work indicates that ARF5/MP broadly influences the expression of the Aux/IAA gene family, and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors. These groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on ARF5. Similar detailed analyses of other Aux/IAA-ARF regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440550": "A well-known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. This study investigated the role of a drought-up-regulated Triticum aestivum NAC69-1 (TaNAC69-1) in the modulation of root growth in wheat. TaNAC69-1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage. Overexpression of TaNAC69-1 in wheat roots using OsRSP3 (essentially root-specific) and OsPIP2;3 (root-predominant) promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass. Competitive growth analysis under water-limited conditions showed that OsRSP3 promoter-driven TaNAC69-1 transgenic lines produced 32% and 35% more above-ground biomass and grains than wild-type plants, respectively. TaNAC69-1 overexpression in the roots down-regulated the expression of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7, which are from the auxin/IAA (Aux/IAA) transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators SHY2/IAA3 and IAA7 in Arabidopsis. The expression of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7 in roots was down-regulated by drought stress and up-regulated by cytokinin treatment, which inhibited root growth. DNA binding and transient expression analyses revealed that TaNAC69-1 bound to the promoters of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7, acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the TaSHY2 or TaIAA7 promoter. These data suggest that TaNAC69-1 is a transcriptional repressor of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7 homologous to Arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16478940": "Auxin mediates numerous plant responses, some of which have been shown to require transcriptional regulation. One auxin response pathway, which depends on the relief of transcriptional repression, is mediated by TIR1 (transport inhibitor response protein 1). TIR1 is an auxin receptor and also a subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase. In the presence of a low concentration of auxin in the nucleus, members of the Aux/IAA family of transcriptional repressors bind to ARF proteins and inhibit the transcription of specific auxin response genes. Increased nuclear concentrations of auxin promote auxin binding to TIR1, causing the Aux/IAA proteins to associate with TIR1 and leading to their degradation by a proteasome-mediated pathway. This decreases the concentration of Aux/IAA proteins in the nucleus and thereby enables the expression of certain auxin response genes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15546359": "Recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins: the auxin (Aux) response factors (ARFs), the Aux/IAAs, and the F-box protein TIR1. The ARF proteins bind DNA and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the Aux/IAA proteins repress ARF function. TIR1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of Arabidopsis called axr5-1. Mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin-related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms. Further, the axr5-1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin-regulated transcription. The molecular cloning of AXR5 revealed that the gene encodes the IAA1 protein, a member of the Aux/IAA family of proteins. AXR5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype. The axr5-1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain II of the protein, similar to gain-of-function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family. Biochemical studies show that IAA1/AXR5 interacts with TIR1 in an auxin-dependent manner. The mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of IAA1/AXR5. Our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the Aux/IAA family are targeted for degradation by SCFTIR1 in response to auxin."
