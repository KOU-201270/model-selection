However, the efficient calculation of EFMs in genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) is still a challenge. We present a novel algorithm that uses a linear programming-based tree search and efficiently enumerates a subset of EFMs in GSMNs. Our approach is compared with the EFMEvolver approach, demonstrating a significant improvement in computation time. We also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the Escherichia coli bacteria. To do so, we computed 1 million EFMs for each energetic amino acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino acid based on gene/protein expression data and the obtained EFMs. We found good agreement between previous experiments and the conclusions reached using EFMs. Finally, we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large GSMNs. The stand-alone software TreeEFM is implemented in C++ and interacts with the open-source linear solver COIN-OR Linear program Solver (CLP).",

Among them, those based on solving linear programming (LP) problems are known to be very efficient if the main interest lies in computing large enough sets of EFMs. Here, we propose a new method called EFM-Ta that boosts the efficiency rate by analyzing the information provided by the LP solver. We base our method on a further study of the final tableau of the simplex method. By performing additional elementary steps and avoiding trivial solutions consisting of two cycles, we obtain many more EFMs for each LP problem posed, improving the efficiency rate of previously proposed methods by more than one order of magnitude.

TransCon CNP is in clinical development for the treatment of comorbidities associated with achondroplasia. In both mice and cynomolgus monkeys, sustained exposure to CNP via TransCon CNP was more efficacious in stimulating bone growth than intermittent CNP exposure. TransCon CNP was well tolerated with no adverse cardiovascular effects observed at exposure levels exceeding the expected clinical therapeutic exposure. At equivalent dose levels, reductions in blood pressure and/or an increase in heart rate were seen following single subcutaneous injections of the unconjugated CNP-38 molecule or a daily CNP-39 molecule (same amino acid sequence as Vosoritide, USAN:INN). The half-life of the daily CNP-39 molecule in cynomolgus monkey was estimated to be 20 minutes, compared with 90 hours for CNP-38, released from TransCon CNP. <i>C</i> <sub>max</sub> for the CNP-39 molecule (20 <i>\u00b5</i>g/kg) was approximately 100-fold higher, compared with the peak CNP level associated with administration of 100 <i>\u00b5</i>g/kg CNP as TransCon CNP. Furthermore, CNP exposure for the daily CNP-39 molecule was only evident for up to 2 hours postdose (lower limit of quantification 37 pmol/l), whereas TransCon CNP gave rise to systemic exposure to CNP-38 for at least 7 days postdose. The prolonged CNP exposure and associated hemodynamically safe peak serum concentrations associated with TransCon CNP administration are suggested to improve efficacy, compared with short-lived CNP molecules, due to better therapeutic drug coverage and decreased risk of hypotension. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The hormone C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is in clinical development for the treatment of comorbidities associated with achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism. The TransCon Technology was used to design TransCon CNP, a prodrug that slowly releases active CNP in the body over several days. Preclinical data show great promise for TransCon CNP to be an effective and well-tolerated drug that provides sustained levels of CNP in a convenient once-weekly dose, while avoiding high systemic CNP bolus concentrations that can induce cardiovascular side effects.",

Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 \u03bcg per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 \u03bcg per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 \u03bcg per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 \u03bcg per kilogram and then to 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 \u03bcg per kilogram for up to 42 months. In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

In the hematopoietic system, the ANS regulates stem cell niche homeostasis and regeneration and fine-tunes the inflammatory response. Additionally, emerging data suggest that cancer cells take advantage of innervating neural circuitry to promote their progression.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17615391": "The brain is the key organ of the response to stress because it determines what is threatening and, therefore, potentially stressful, as well as the physiological and behavioral responses which can be either adaptive or damaging. Stress involves two-way communication between the brain and the cardiovascular, immune, and other systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms. Beyond the \"flight-or-fight\" response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body (\"allostatic load\"). Yet, hormones associated with stress protect the body in the short-run and promote adaptation (\"allostasis\"). The brain is a target of stress, and the hippocampus was the first brain region, besides the hypothalamus, to be recognized as a target of glucocorticoids. Stress and stress hormones produce both adaptive and maladaptive effects on this brain region throughout the life course. Early life events influence life-long patterns of emotionality and stress responsiveness and alter the rate of brain and body aging. The hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex undergo stress-induced structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses. As an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy, social and behavioral interventions such as regular physical activity and social support reduce the chronic stress burden and benefit brain and body health and resilience.",

Although it is not known whether invertebrates possess an autonomic nervous system identical to that of vertebrates, evidence shows invertebrates have a sympathetic-like response to regulate the internal environment and ready the organism to act behaviorally to a given stimuli. Furthermore, this physiological response can be feasibly measured and it acts as a biological index for the animal's internal state. Measurements of the physiological response can be directly related to internal and external stressors through changes in the central nervous system controlled coordination of the cardio-vascular and respiratory systems. More specifically, monitoring heart and ventilation rates provide quantifiable measures of the stress response not always behaviorally observed. Crayfish are good model organisms for heart and ventilatory rate measurements due to the feasibility of recording, as well as the rich history known of the morphology of the crayfish, dating back to Huxley in 1888, and the well-studied typical behaviors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704321": "In the complex microcosm of a cell, information security and its faithful transmission are critical for maintaining internal stability. To achieve a coordinated response of all its parts to any stimulus the cell must protect the information received from potentially confounding signals. Physical segregation of the information transmission chain ensures that only the entities able to perform the encoded task have access to the relevant information. The cAMP intracellular signaling pathway is an important system for signal transmission responsible for the ancestral 'flight or fight' response and involved in the control of critical functions including frequency and strength of heart contraction, energy metabolism and gene transcription. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the cAMP signaling pathway uses compartmentalization as a strategy for coordinating the large number of key cellular functions under its control. Spatial confinement allows the formation of cAMP signaling \"hot spots\" at discrete subcellular domains in response to specific stimuli, bringing the information in proximity to the relevant effectors and their recipients, thus achieving specificity of action. In this report we discuss how the different constituents of the cAMP pathway are targeted and participate in the formation of cAMP compartmentalized signaling events. We illustrate a few examples of localized cAMP signaling, with a particular focus on the nucleus, the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of interventions designed to perturb specific cAMP cascades locally.",

To estimate the minimal clinically important difference for the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey in generalized or segmental dystonia. A total of 898 paired examinations of 198 consecutive patients, aged &gt;18 years, with idiopathic and inherited (torsin family 1 member A positive) segmental and generalized isolated dystonia were analyzed. To calculate the minimal clinically important difference thresholds, both anchor- and distribution-based methods were used simultaneously. Any improvement &gt;16.6% or worsening larger than 21.5% on the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale indicates a minimal, yet clinically relevant, change. Threshold values for the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Disability Scale were 0.5 points for both decline and improvement. Cut-off scores for the Physical Component Summary, the Mental Component Summary, and the Global (Total or Overall) Score of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were 5.5 and 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5, and 7.5 and 8.5 points for clinically meaningful improvement and deterioration, respectively. The minimal clinically important difference represents the smallest change in an outcome measure that is meaningful to patients. Our estimates for the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey may allow more reliable judgment of the clinical relevance of different treatments for segmental and generalized isolated dystonia. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Dystonic pain was assessed in a cohort of 140 children, 71 males and 69 females, median age 11 years 11 months (range 3y-19y 1mo), undergoing DBS in our centre over a period of 10 years. The cohort was divided into aetiological dystonia groups: 1a, inherited; 1b, heredodegenerative; 2, acquired; and 3, idiopathic. Motor responses were measured with the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). Dystonic pain was identified in 63 (45%) patients, 38% of whom had a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP). Dystonic pain improved in 90% of children and in all aetiological subgroups 1 year after DBS, while the BFMDRS motor score improved in 70%. Statistically significant improvement (p&lt;0.01) was noted for the whole cohort on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (n=27), Paediatric Pain Profile (n=17), and Caregivers Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities questionnaire (n=48). There was reduction of pain severity, frequency, and analgesia requirement. Findings were similar for the whole cohort and aetiological subgroups other than the inherited heredodegenerative group where the improvement did not reach statistical significance. Dystonic pain is frequent in children with dystonia, including those with CP, who undergo DBS; this can be an important, realizable goal of surgery irrespective of aetiology. We encourage the use of multimodal approach in pain research to reduce the risk of bias.",

Using a longitudinal retrospective design, we assessed the clinical outcomes of nine patients who underwent STN-DBS for treatment-refractory pediatric isolated dystonia one decade ago (mean age at surgery: 15.9 \u00b1 4.5 years). The primary clinical outcome used was assessed by retrospective video analyses of patients' dystonia symptoms using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 1-year follow-up (1-yr FU), and 10-year follow-up (10-yr FU). Adverse side effects, including surgery-related, device-related, and stimulation-related effects, were also documented. After STN-DBS surgery, the mean improvement in the BFMDRS motor score was 77.1 \u00b1 26.6% at 1-yr FU and 90.4 \u00b1 10.4% at 10-yr FU. Similarly, the mean BFMDRS disability score was improved by 69.5 \u00b1 13.6% at 1-yr FU and by 86.5 \u00b1 13.9% at 10-yr FU. The clinical improvements gained at 10-yr FU were significantly larger than those observed at 1-yr FU. Negative correlations were found between the duration of disease to age at surgery ratio (DD/AS) and the improvements in the BFMDRS motor score and total score at 1-yr FU and 10-yr FU. To our knowledge, this study provides the first clinical evidence for the short- and long-term effectiveness and safety of STN-DBS for pediatric isolated dystonia.

The patients were assessed with Frankfurt Body Concept Scale, Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey, Hamilton Depression Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Social Phobia Inventory and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale. The disease severity was evaluated with Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale. Patients with dystonia had a significantly impaired body concept in eight out of nine subscales in comparison to healthy controls. The differences were most pronounced for the subscales general health, body care, physical efficacy, sexuality and physical appearance (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, all eight subscales of SF-36 exhibited significantly lower values in patients with dystonia compared to controls. We also found significant positive correlations between SF-36 and body concept subscales. Impairment of body concept was not associated with disease severity or levels of social anxiety symptoms. However, there was a significant association between self-rated depression and disease severity. Our patients suffered from increased depression and social anxiety symptoms except social interaction anxiety. We conclude that patients with dystonia have significant body concept impairment that interferes with quality of life in both physical and emotional domains.

In healthy young children, we aimed to determine whether physiologically immature movements and postures can induce an age-related effect on Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement and disability scale scores. Nine assessors specializied in movement disorders (3 adult neurologists, 3 pediatric neurologists, and 3 MD/PhD students) independently scored the Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement scale in 52 healthy children (4-16 years of age; 2 boys and 2 girls per year of age). Independent of that, parents scored their children's functional motor development according to the Burke-Fahn-Marsden disability scale in another 52 healthy children (4-16 years of age; 2 boys and 2 girls per year of age).

More variable results are reported in secondary dystonias and its efficacy in this heterogeneous group has not been fully elucidated. Deep brain stimulation outcomes are typically reported using impairment-focused measures, such as the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, which provide little information about function and participation outcomes or changes in non-motor areas. The aim is to demonstrate that in some cases of secondary dystonia, the sole use of impairment level measures, such as the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, may be insufficient to fully evaluate outcome following deep brain stimulation. Six paediatric cases who underwent deep brain stimulation surgery with a minimum of one year follow up were selected on the basis of apparent non-response to deep brain stimulation, defined as a clinically insignificant change in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Movement Scale (&lt;20%), but where other evaluation measures demonstrated clinical efficacy across several domains. Despite no significant change in Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale scores following deep brain stimulation, parallel outcome measures demonstrated significant benefit in a range of child and family-centred goal areas including: pain and comfort, school attendance, seating tolerance, access to assistive technology and in some cases carer burden. Sole use of impairment-focused measures, are limited in scope to evaluate outcome following deep brain stimulation, particularly in secondary dystonias. Systematic study of effects across multiple dimensions of disability is needed to determine what deep brain stimulation offers patients in terms of function, participation, care, comfort and quality of life.

Children with HMDs (n=161; median age 10y 3mo, range 2y 6mo-21y) were assessed using the BFM-M, GMFCS, MACS, and CFCS from 2007 to 2013. This cross-sectional study contrasts the information provided by these scales. All four scales were strongly associated (all Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rs &gt;0.72, p&lt;0.001), with worse dystonia severity implying worse function. Secondary dystonias had worse dystonia and less function than primary dystonias (p&lt;0.001). A longer proportion of life lived with dystonia is associated with more severe dystonia (rs =0.42, p&lt;0.001). The BFM-M is strongly linked with the GMFCS, MACS, and CFCS, irrespective of aetiology. Each scale offers interrelated but complementary information and is applicable to all aetiologies. Movement disorders including cerebral palsy can be effectively evaluated using these scales.",

However, assessments of its efficacy and safety have been limited to several case reports and small studies. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in 15 patients with primary Meige syndrome who responded poorly to medical treatments or botulinum toxin injections. Using the movement and disability subscores of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, the authors evaluated the severity of patients' dystonia and related before surgery and at final follow-up during neurostimulation. The movement scale was assessed based on preoperative and postoperative video documentation by an independent rater who was unaware of each patient's neurostimulation status. Quality of life was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey. RESULTS The dystonia movement subscores in 14 consecutive patients improved from 19.3 \u00b1 7.6 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) before surgery to 5.5 \u00b1 4.5 at final follow-up (28.5 \u00b1 16.5 months), with a mean improvement of 74% (p &lt; 0.05). The disability subscore improved from 15.6 \u00b1 4.9 before surgery to 6.1 \u00b1 3.5 at final follow-up (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the postoperative SF-36 scores increased markedly over those at baseline. The authors also found that bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus immediately improved patient symptoms after stimulation and required lower stimulation parameters than those needed for pallidal deep brain stimulation for primary Meige syndrome. Four adverse events occurred in 3 patients; all of these events resolved without permanent sequelae. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide further evidence to support the long-term efficacy and safety of subthalamic nucleus stimulation as an alternative treatment for patients with medically intractable Meige syndrome.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15264773": "Object. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is a promising new procedure for the treatment of dystonia. The authors present their technical approach for placement of electrodes into the GPi in awake patients with dystonia, including the methodology used for electrophysiological mapping of the GPi in the dystonic state, clinical outcomes and complications, and the location of electrodes associated with optimal benefit. Methods. Twenty-three adult and pediatric patients who had various forms of dystonia were included in this study. Baseline neurological status and improvement in motor function resulting from DBS were measured using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). Implantation of the DBS lead was performed using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based stereotaxy, single-cell microelectrode recording, and intraoperative test stimulation to determine thresholds for stimulation-induced adverse effects. Electrode locations were measured on computationally reformatted postoperative MR images according to a prospective protocol. Conclusions. Physiologically guided implantation of DBS electrodes in patients with dystonia is technically feasible in the awake state in most cases, with low morbidity rates. Spontaneous discharge rates of GPi neurons in dystonia are similar to those of globus pallidus externus neurons, such that the two nuclei must be distinguished by neuronal discharge patterns rather than by rates. Active electrode locations associated with robust improvement (&gt; 50% decrease in BFMDRS score) were located near the intercommissural plane, at a mean distance of 3.7 mm from the pallidocapsular border. Patients with juvenile-onset primary dystonia and those with the tardive form benefited greatly from this procedure, whereas benefits for most secondary dystonias and the adult-onset craniocervical form of this disorder were more modest.",

Video rating was performed at three time points: pre-operative, 1-year short-term follow-up (1y-FU) and long-term last FU (LT-FU, up to 13 years). Symptom severity and disability were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). Disability scores were obtained from clinical charts and during the last FU. The mean improvement in BFMDRS motor score was 54.4 \u00b1 8.9 % at 1y-FU and 42.9 \u00b1 11.6 % at LT-FU; the disability scores improved by 59.8 \u00b1 10.3 and 63.3 \u00b1 7.8 %, respectively. Electrode dislocation was noted in one patient and implantable pulse generator dislocation in another, both requiring surgical intervention; no further serious adverse events occurred. Our study presents the first blinded video rating assessment of the short- and long-term effects of pallidal DBS in children with idiopathic or hereditary isolated dystonia.

A 27-year-old woman with a 22-year history of DRD underwent GPi DBS. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) were used to regularly assess changes in the patient's condition after DBS treatment.

In addition, the MMSE, MOCA, HAMA, and HAMD scores of the patient were 30, 30, 1, and 2, respectively. Intelligence and cognitive levels of the patient did not change significantly compared with the preoperative baseline level, whereas anxiety and depression status of the patient improved compared with the preoperative status. GPi DBS treatment can significantly improve the symptoms of systemic dystonia in patients with DRD, and to a certain extent improve the anxiety and depression status of these patients. Therefore, we conclude that GPi DBS is an alternative safe and effective treatment for patients with DRD.",

Lesioning or stimulation of the pallidothalamic tract has ameliorating effects on dyskinesia and dystonia in patients with Parkinson disease. However, the effect of the procedure on dystonia due to other etiologies has not been reported. We retrospectively analyzed patients with dystonia who underwent unilateral pallidothalamic tractotomy between July 2017 and October 2018 at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-Movement Scale was used to evaluate the severity of dystonia at three time points (before surgery, 3 months postoperatively, and the last available follow-up). Adverse events were also evaluated. Eleven patients underwent unilateral pallidothalamic tractotomy, including 5 with generalized dystonia, 4 with segmental dystonia, and 2 with focal (cervical) dystonia. All patients had undergone unilateral pallidotomy before contralateral pallidothalamic tractotomy. The mean interval between the previous surgery (pallidotomy) and pallidothalamic tractotomy was 9.5 \u00b1 3.1 months. The mean follow-up period was 11.5 \u00b1 4.2 months.

All groups demonstrated significant improvement in individualised goal attainment, measured with the COPM, at 1-year post-DBS. The secondary dystonia-CP group also achieved significant improvement at 6 months for performance and satisfaction scores. In the majority of secondary dystonias, the BFMDRS failed to demonstrate significant improvement. A linear correlation between change in BFMDRS and COPM scores was observed when the entire cohort was analysed. DBS improved functional performance, independently of the dystonic phenotype.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20207700": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation encompasses a heterogeneous group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by iron accumulation in the brain. Severe generalized dystonia is frequently a prominent symptom and can be very disabling, causing gait impairment, difficulty with speech and swallowing, pain and respiratory distress. Several case reports and one case series have been published concerning therapeutic outcome of pallidal deep brain stimulation in dystonia caused by neurodegeneration with brain iron degeneration, reporting mostly favourable outcomes. However, with case studies, there may be a reporting bias towards favourable outcome. Thus, we undertook this multi-centre retrospective study to gather worldwide experiences with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation in patients with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. A total of 16 centres contributed 23 patients with confirmed neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. Patient details including gender, age at onset, age at operation, genetic status, magnetic resonance imaging status, history and clinical findings were requested. Data on severity of dystonia (Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-Motor Scale, Barry Albright Dystonia Scale), disability (Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-Disability Scale), quality of life (subjective global rating from 1 to 10 obtained retrospectively from patient and caregiver) as well as data on supportive therapy, concurrent pharmacotherapy, stimulation settings, adverse events and side effects were collected. Data were collected once preoperatively and at 2-6 and 9-15 months postoperatively. The primary outcome measure was change in severity of dystonia. The mean improvement in severity of dystonia was 28.5% at 2-6 months and 25.7% at 9-15 months. At 9-15 months postoperatively, 66.7% of patients showed an improvement of 20% or more in severity of dystonia, and 31.3% showed an improvement of 20% or more in disability. Global quality of life ratings showed a median improvement of 83.3% at 9-15 months. Severity of dystonia preoperatively and disease duration predicted improvement in severity of dystonia at 2-6 months; this failed to reach significance at 9-15 months. The study confirms that dystonia in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation improves with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation, although this improvement is not as great as the benefit reported in patients with primary generalized dystonias or some other secondary dystonias. The patients with more severe dystonia seem to benefit more.

Statistically significant positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) were observed between dystonia severity and increasing HD disease stage and motor disease duration. Deterioration in functional capacity also correlated with increasing dystonia severity. No significant relationship was observed with age at motor symptom onset or CAG repeat length. We report a high prevalence of dystonia in adult patients with HD, with worsening dystonia severity with increasing HD disease stage and motor disease duration.

To evaluate the concordance between three unblinded clinical raters and one single-blinded rater for 10 prospective series of ratings on the BFM scale in 22 dystonic patients of the SPIDY study. Ten assessments on the BFM scale were performed under various stimulation conditions at different time points (before surgery and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months afterwards). Patients were first evaluated by three unblinded clinical raters (one per center). All assessments were videotaped and sent to a blinded rater. Intra- and inter-rater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. The intra-rater reliability at inclusion was better for the blinded rater than for the clinical raters. The inter-rater reliability (comparing the blinded rater with each clinical rater) was \"very good\" at inclusion, \"fair\" at month 1 and was \"good\" at month 3, month 6, and month 12. Blinding (rather than video) is probably the key factor in better intra-rater reliability and can produce more accurate rating than clinical rating. Consequently, a blind procedure should be performed systematically in multicenter studies.

Review of the international literature on the clinical use of MTX in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. MTX has emerged as a relatively safe and effective treatment for RA that compares favorably with other therapies, particularly because of its considerably longer median drug survival. The toxicity profile of MTX is well established and includes serious and sometimes fatal liver disease, pneumonitis, and cytopenias. Hence, regular and careful monitoring of patients taking MTX is essential, particularly when MTX is combined with other DMARDs. Folate supplementation can reduce some of the most common side effects of MTX, but it has not yet been established whether this translates into a reduced risk of serious disease. Another potential approach to reducing the toxicity of MTX is therapeutic drug monitoring and dose individualization. However, correlations between pharmacokinetics and clinical response have been addressed in only a few studies and with conflicting results. MTX is an effective DMARD with a relatively safe profile compared with other therapies. Folate supplementation can significantly reduce the risk of MTX toxicity.

These include folate antagonism, adenosine signaling, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease in adhesion molecules, alteration of cytokine profiles, and polyamine inhibition amongst some others. Currently, adenosine signaling is probably the most widely accepted explanation for the methotrexate mechanism in RA given that methotrexate increases adenosine levels and on engagement of adenosine with its extracellular receptors an intracellular cascade is activated promoting an overall anti-inflammatory state. In addition to these hypotheses, we examine the mechanism of methotrexate in RA from the perspective of its adverse effects and consider some of the newer genetic markers of methotrexate efficacy and toxicity in RA. Lastly, we briefly discuss the mechanism of additive methotrexate in the setting of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor treatment of RA.

Electronic databases and registries were searched for recommendations on MTX use in RA, duplicates were eliminated, and the most updated version adopted when there were several versions on the same recommendation. Reviewers used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument for study quality assessment. Similarities and discrepancies of recommendations are reported. After deduplication, 1693 unique citations were found; 25 full texts were screened and 12 included in the narrative synthesis. Average scores for the AGREE II domains ranged from 33.3 to 83.3%. Recommendations targeted rheumatologists and health care providers involved in RA care. Most covered some but not all of the following areas: baseline \"pre-MTX\" assessment (7/12;58%), prescription of MTX (10/12;83.3%), management of MTX side effects (6/12;50%), and special considerations (e.g., peri-operative management) (8/12; 66.7%). Recommendations agreed on baseline tests prior to starting MTX, monitoring, and need for folic acid supplementation. These aspects can serve as the foundation for the development of MTX recommendations relevant to LDCs. Recommendations disagreed on the MTX starting dose, optimal route, titration, and intervals to monitor toxicity. Existing recommendations do not uniformly address all aspects related to the use of MTX and disagree in relevant aspects of MTX use. Adaptations to these recommendations are needed to facilitate their implementation in LDCs. Key Points \u2022 This paper summarizes current recommendations on the use of methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. \u2022 Areas of agreement between recommendations include the following: pre-methotrexate patient assessment, need for folic acid supplementation, and toxicity monitoring. \u2022 Areas of disagreement relate to methotrexate starting and maximal dose, titration, and frequency of assessments.",

With the increased use of MTX, reports of opportunistic infections associated with MTX therapy have appeared. Fourteen cases of pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia in patients receiving low dose MTX have been previously reported. Yet, no case of PC pneumonia associated with low dose MTX has so far been reported in Japan. We report the first case in Japan of PC pneumonia occurring in a patient with rheumatoid vasculitis who was receiving low dose MTX. A 70-year old woman with 13 year history of RA presented with 3-day history of rapidly aggravating dyspnea, dry cough and fever. She had been receiving MTX 7.5 mg/week for 2.5 months because of her vasculitis symptoms. She had also been receiving prednisolone 7.5 mg/day which had been successfully tapered from an initial dose of 15 mg/day. At the time of her presentation with respiratory symptoms, all of her vasculitis symptoms had been alleviated. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse interstitial shadowing bilaterally and bilateral hilar and right lower lung field infiltrates. Her arterial blood gas showed severe hypoxemia (PaO2 27.7 torr). Polymerase chain reaction assay of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed PC. Although the patient required ventilatory support for 9 days, she was successfully treated with trimethoprime-sulphamethoxazole and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Eight months later, the patient was well with no evidence of vasculitis or respiratory symptoms.",

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate, during a 6 yr period, the prevalence and severity of bronchopulmonary side-effects in RA patients treated with MTX. A cohort of 130 RA in-patients (106 women, 24 men) treated with MTX was studied for the occurrence of respiratory adverse events. Adverse bronchopulmonary side-effects were observed in 12 patients (two men, 10 women), with a mean disease duration of 15 yr. Only three patients had previously suffered from pulmonary disease. MTX treatment duration was between 1 month and 4.5 yr. The diagnosis was that of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP) in four cases, non-HSP pneumonitis in five patients with one case of Pneumocystis carinii infection, and bronchitis in three cases. The initial respiratory symptoms were not discriminatory between the different conditions. Risk factors were not identified for the occurrence of HSP. HSP always occurred in the first 5 months of treatment. Two patients with HSP died, and another patient with opportunistic infection underwent tracheostomy. HSP represents a potentially lethal side-effect in RA patients treated with MTX. Improved education of patients and physicians should certainly lead to a reduction of both the prevalence and severity of pulmonary side-effects during MTX therapy in RA.",

Herein, we report the case of a 64-year-old Japanese woman with RA who showed complications of EBV-positive MTX-associated LPD. This case is exceedingly rare in that the LPD was confined to the lungs and its subclassification was extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Only four cases of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma in the setting of MTX-associated LPD have ever been reported in the English language literature, only one of which was an extranasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, similar to our case. Extranasal NK/T-cell lymphomas show more aggressive behavior than nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas, possibly reflected by the considerable re-exacerbation of the lesions in only two months after the cessation of MTX in our case. However, the SMILE regimen (steroid, methotrexate, ifosfamide, l-asparaginase, and etoposide) was able to suppress tumor growth in this case.",

Although SASP and MTX are commonly used, the mechanism(s) by which these drugs control the inflammation that characterizes RA have remained obscure. Results from my laboratory indicate that these agents share a mode of action; the anti-inflammatory effects of both SASP and MTX are due, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, to their capacity to enhance adenosine release at inflamed sites. This mode of action suggests that the development of agents that directly alter adenosine metabolism may lead to new, more effective and safer antirheumatic drugs than those currently available.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14963199": " The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) has become established as the most commonly used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but is commonly discontinued due to adverse effects. Adverse effects are thought to be mediated via folate antagonism. In this paper we summarize the current data on the use of folates as a supplement to MTX use in RA for the prevention of adverse effects and as a potential modulator of cardiovascular risk, and propose guidelines for standard practice. A Medline search was performed using the search terms \"methotrexate\", \"folic acid\", \"folinic acid\", \"folate\" and \"homocysteine\". Literature relevant to the use of folates as a supplement to MTX in the treatment of RA was reviewed and other papers referred to as references were explored. The use of supplemental folates, including folic and folinic acid, in RA patients treated with MTX has been shown to improve continuation rates by reducing the incidence of liver function test abnormalities and gastrointestinal intolerance. Folate supplements do not appear to significantly reduce the effectiveness of MTX in the treatment of RA. Furthermore, supplemental folic acid offsets the elevation in plasma homocysteine associated with the use of MTX. This may in turn reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is over-represented amongst patients with RA, and for which hyperhomocysteinaemia is now recognized as an independent risk factor. We propose that folic acid supplements be prescribed routinely to all patients receiving MTX for the treatment of RA. We recommend a pragmatic dosing schedule of 5 mg of oral folic acid given on the morning following the day of MTX administration.",

The mechanisms by which MTX exerts these effects in RA are unknown. We aimed to evaluate whether MTX reduces vaccine-specific serum Ig levels and their functionality in RA patients following vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and if numbers of antigen-specific circulating plasmablasts are affected. Ten patients with RA on MTX and 10 RA patients without disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) were immunized with a dose 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar13). Circulating plasmablasts producing total IgG and IgA as well as specific IgG and IgA against two pneumococcal capsular serotypes (6B and 23F) were enumerated using ELISPOT 6days after vaccination. IgG levels against both these serotypes were determined with ELISA before and 4-6weeks after vaccination. Positive antibody response was defined as \u2a7e2-fold increase of pre-vaccination antibody levels. The functionality of vaccine specific antibodies to serotype 23F was evaluated by measuring their ability to opsonize bacteria using opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) in 4 randomly chosen RA patients on MTX and 4 RA patients without DMARD. After vaccination, RA patients on MTX showed significant increase in pre- to postvaccination antibody levels for 6B (p&lt;0.05), while patients without DMARD had significant increases for both 6B and 23F (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively). Only 10% of RA on MTX and 40% of RA patients without DMARD showed positive post-vaccination antibody responses for both serotypes. Increased opsonizing ability after vaccination was detected in 1 of 4 RA patients on MTX and 3 of 4 patients on RA without DMARD. However, numbers of circulating total and vaccine-specific IgG- or IgA-producing plasmablasts did not differ between RA patients with or without MTX. MTX treatment in RA leads to reduced vaccine-specific antibody responses and their functionality compared to untreated RA following pneumococcal vaccination using polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine. However, since there was no reduction in numbers of circulating total or vaccine-specific antibody-producing plasmablasts after vaccination this effect is probably not due to reduced activation of B cells in lymphoid tissue. <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02240888\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02240888</a>.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26474779": "Methotrexate is the most common disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Current evidence supports its efficacy in the treatment of RA, resulting in improved short-term disease control and long-term outcomes in terms of radiographic progression. Oral methotrexate has traditionally been used first-line due to various reasons, including ease of administration, low cost and easy availability. A methotrexate dose of &gt;15 mg/week is generally required for disease control but oral methotrexate may be only partially effective or poorly tolerated in some patients. The rationale for using subcutaneous (SC) methotrexate is based on its improved bioavailability at higher doses and better tolerability in some patients who have side effects when receiving oral methotrexate. Current guidance advocates 'treating to target', with the aim of inducing remission in RA patients. In some patients, this can be achieved using methotrexate alone or in combination with other traditional DMARDs. Patients who have not responded to two DMARDs, including methotrexate, are eligible for biological therapy as per current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in the UK. Biological treatments are expensive and using SC methotrexate can improve disease control in RA patients, thus potentially avoiding or delaying the requirement for future biological treatment.",

For the low doses used in RA (less than 15 mg/week), MTX is completely and rapidly absorbed with an active process membrane transport. The frequent toxic effects of this drug (hepatotoxicity, hematologic or possible long-term oncogenicity) limit its widespread use. MTX is as effective in treating RA as the other second line drugs and always more rapidly effective, perhaps because of anti-inflammatory properties. MTX must at the present time be used only in severe RA, refractory to more than one classical slow acting drug. Despite this, it is an extremely promising new agent in the therapy of rheumatic diseases.",

Here, we report an RA case that also had ITP, which did not decrease in platelet count after methotrexate therapy. A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in 1990, RA in 1995, and ITP in 2000. She had received hydroxychloroquine for more than 5 years. She was treated with prednisolone 16 mg/daily between 2006 and 2007, but she discontinued this therapy because of weight gain. Laboratory findings were not remarkable, except for thrombocytopenia. We started methotrexate therapy 10 mg per week for treatment of RA, and hydroxychloroquine therapy was stopped due to nonresponse. The methotrexate dose was increased up to 15 mg/week. Her complete blood cell count was monitored frequently. We did not observe any decrease in platelet count, while active arthritis symptoms of the patient were relieved.

Historically, oral (PO) preparations of MTX have been used in the USA with minimal parenteral (subcutaneous, SC, and intramuscular, IM) administration.

Methotrexate is generally the first-line drug for the treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, and it enhances the effect of most biologic agents in RA. Understanding the mechanism of action of methotrexate could be instructive in the appropriate use of the drug and in the design of new regimens for the treatment of RA. Although methotrexate is one of the first examples of intelligent drug design, multiple mechanisms potentially contribute to the anti-inflammatory actions of methotrexate, including the inhibition of purine and pyrimidine synthesis, transmethylation reactions, translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to the nucleus, signalling via the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and nitric oxide production, as well as the promotion of adenosine release and expression of certain long non-coding RNAs.",

However, is there any reason to single this drug out for early RA? Mechanistically, it probably works differently in RA than in cancer, at least in part. Thus, in addition to dihydrofolate reductase-related effects, MTX inhibits aminoimidazocarboxamide transformylase, decreases leukotriene B4 production, and increases adenosine release at concentrations achieved with low-dose MTX regimens. Clinically, it is well tolerated over relatively long periods. Further, a recent meta-analysis of radiology studies shows that MTX compares favorably with intramuscular gold and is better than azathioprine. Toxicity remains a concern in treating early RA, particularly as pulmonary \"hypersensitivity reactions\" continue (1% to 7.6%), infections (both fungal and perioperative) are documented, and more cirrhosis is found. With all of the above in mind, the use of MTX seems reasonable but not necessarily uniformly appropriate and not yet proved for early RA.

The drug had been synthesized in 1948 and first tests to treat patients with psoriasis and RA were published in 1951. However, until the 1980s there was only limited use of MTX in the treatment of RA. Since the 1990s MTX is the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) of first choice for the treatment of RA in most countries worldwide. By definition, DMARDs in RA are those compounds for which an inhibiting effect on radiographic progression has been demonstrated. Several combinations of DMARDs have been tested, most commonly with MTX as the anchor drug. Regarding the route of administration of MTX there is some evidence that the parenteral route, most often performed subcutaneously, has some additional benefits over the oral route. In MTX monotherapy, dosages up to 30 mg/week are now used. There are now three main combinations that are playing an important role: MTX + sulfasalazine (SSZ) + hydroxychloroquine, MTX + leflunomide (LEF), and MTX + biologics such as antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and other new compounds which block the interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor or T-cell activation and delete B cells. Regarding clinical efficacy, MTX monotherapy has performed almost similarly well in comparison with biologic mono-therapy, both usually combined with glucocorticoids. However, structural damage is usually inhibited to a significantly greater degree with the biologics. The combination of MTX with biologics has proven superior to either agent alone in all aspects. Current strategic regimens which concentrate on systematic ways to bring patients into remission all include MTX as first choice.",

The importance of MTX in earlier and more aggressive management of RA patients cannot be overstated. MTX courses show some of the longest continuation rates reported in clinical medicine, due to both effectiveness and safety. The safety profile of MTX indicates that it is among the safest of any mediation used for the treatment of any arthritis.

Novel transcript discovery enabled by joint analysis of large collections of RNA-seq data sets has emerged as one such analysis. Current methods for transcript discovery rely on a '2-Step' approach where the first step encompasses building transcripts from individual data sets, followed by the second step that merges predicted transcripts across data sets. To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collections of RNA-seq data sets, we developed a novel '1-Step' approach named Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM) that builds transcript models from pooled RNA-seq data sets. We demonstrate in a computational benchmark that 1-Step outperforms 2-Step approaches in predicting overall transcript structures and individual splice junctions, while performing competitively in detecting exonic nucleotides. Applying PRAM to 30 human ENCODE RNA-seq data sets identified unannotated transcripts with epigenetic and RAMPAGE signatures similar to those of recently annotated transcripts. In a case study, we discovered and experimentally validated new transcripts through the application of PRAM to mouse hematopoietic RNA-seq data sets. We uncovered new transcripts that share a differential expression pattern with a neighboring gene <i>Pik3cg</i> implicated in human hematopoietic phenotypes, and we provided evidence for the conservation of this relationship in human.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190064": " Despite intensive treatment protocols and recent advances, neuroblastomas still account for approximately 15% of all childhood cancer deaths. In contrast with adult cancers, p53 pathway inactivation in neuroblastomas is rarely caused by p53 mutation but rather by altered MDM2 or p14ARF expression. Moreover, neuroblastomas are characterised by high proliferation rates, frequently triggered by pRb pathway dysfunction due to aberrant expression of cyclin D1, CDK4 or p16INK4a. Simultaneous disturbance of these pathways can occur via co-amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, which encodes both p14ARF and p16INK4a. We examined whether both single and combined inhibition of MDM2 and CDK4/6 is effective in reducing neuroblastoma cell viability. In our panel of ten cell lines with a spectrum of aberrations in the p53 and pRb pathway, idasanutlin and abemaciclib were the most potent MDM2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors, respectively. No correlation was observed between the genetic background and response to the single inhibitors. We confirmed this lack of correlation in isogenic systems overexpressing MDM2 and/or CDK4. In addition, combined inhibition did not result in synergistic effects. Instead, abemaciclib diminished the pro-apoptotic effect of idasanutlin, leading to slightly antagonistic effects. In vivo treatment with idasanutlin and abemaciclib led to reduced tumour growth compared with single drug treatment, but no synergistic response was observed. We conclude that p53 and pRb pathway aberrations cannot be used as predictive biomarkers for neuroblastoma sensitivity to MDM2 and/or CDK4/6 inhibitors. Moreover, we advise to be cautious with combining these inhibitors in neuroblastomas.",

Primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) and characterize the safety profile of idasanutlin monotherapy and combination therapy. Clinical activity and pharmacokinetics were secondary objectives. Two idasanutlin formulations were investigated: a microprecipitate bulk powder (MBP) and optimized spray-dried powder (SDP).

The major clearance enzyme for idasanutlin, UGT1A3, has no association with idasanutlin clearance. Further single-locus and multi-locus association analyses also suggest that no significant UGT polymorphism association with idasanutlin clearance can be detected with the current datasets.

Our understanding of the molecular mechanism whereby SAHA and RG7388 can induce cell cycle arrest and trigger cell death is still evolving. In this study, we performed experiments to measure the cell cycle arrest effects of SAHA and RG7388 using MCF-7 and LNCaP cells. The cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis/necroptosis effects of the SAHA and RG7388 treatments were assessed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion (TBDE) method, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, fluorescence assay with DEVD-amc substrate, and immunoblotting methods. The RG7388 treatment was able to induce cell death by elevating p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> through inhibition of MDM2 in LNCaP, but not in MCF-7 cells, even though there was evidence of p53 elevation. Hence, we suspect that there is some level of uncoupling of p53-mediated transcriptional induction of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> in MCF-7 cells. Our results from MCF-7 and LNCaP cells confirmed that SAHA and RG7388 treatments were able to induce cell death via a combination of cell cycle arrest and cytotoxic mechanisms. We speculate that our findings could lead to the development of newer treatments for breast and prostate cancers with drug combinations including HDACi.",

RO6839921 is an inactive pegylated prodrug of idasanutlin, an MDM2 antagonist, developed for intravenous administration. On cleavage by plasma esterases, the active principle (AP = idasanutlin) is released. This phase 1 study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RO6839921 in patients with advanced solid tumors (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02098967\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02098967</a>). Methods Patients were evaluated on a 5-day dosing schedule every 28 days. Dose escalation used the Bayesian new continual reassessment model. Accelerated dose titration was permitted until grade \u22652 drug-related AEs were observed. The target DLT rate to define the MTD was 16-25%. p53 activation was assessed by measuring macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1). Results Forty-one patients received 14-120 mg AP; 39 were DLT evaluable. The MTD was 110-mg AP (8% DLT rate), whereas 120-mg AP had a 44% DLT rate. DLTs were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and stridor. The most common treatment-related AEs (\u226530%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and thrombocytopenia. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated rapid conversion of prodrug to AP and an approximately linear and dose-proportional dose-exposure relationship, with a 2-fold increase in exposure between Days 1 and 5 of AP. MIC-1 increases were exposure dependent. Stable disease was observed in 14 patients (34%). Conclusions RO6839921 showed reduced pharmacokinetic exposure variability and a safety profile comparable with that of oral idasanutlin. Although this study indicated that RO6839921 could be administered to patients, the results did not provide sufficient differentiation or improvement in the biologic or safety profile compared with oral idasanutlin to support continued development.",

Virtually all cancers inactivate p53 either by mutations/deletions of the <i>TP53</i> gene or by boosting negative regulation of p53 activity. The overexpression of MDM2 protein is one of the most common mechanisms utilized by p53<sup>wt</sup> cancers to keep p53 inactive. Inhibition of MDM2 action by its antagonists has proved its anticancer potential in vitro and is now tested in clinical trials. However, the prolonged treatment of p53<sup>wt</sup> cells with MDM2 antagonists leads to the development of secondary resistance, as shown first for Nutlin-3a, and later for three other small molecules. In the present study, we show that secondary resistance occurs also after treatment of p53<sup>wt</sup> cells with idasanutlin (RG7388, RO5503781), which is the only MDM2 antagonist that has passed phase II and entered phase III clinical trials, so far. Idasanutlin strongly activates p53, as evidenced by the induction of p21 expression and potent cell cycle arrest in all the three cell lines tested, i.e., MCF-7, U-2 OS, and SJSA-1. Notably, apoptosis was induced only in SJSA-1 cells, while MCF-7 and U-2 OS cells were able to restore the proliferation upon the removal of idasanutlin. Moreover, idasanutlin-treated U-2 OS cells could be cultured for long time periods in the presence of the drug. This prolonged treatment led to the generation of p53-mutated resistant cell populations. This resistance was generated de novo, as evidenced by the utilization of monoclonal U-2 OS subpopulations. Thus, although idasanutlin presents much improved activities compared to its precursor, it displays the similar weaknesses, which are limited elimination of cancer cells and the generation of p53-mutated drug-resistant subpopulations.",

In this study, we deliver the rationale and molecular basis for the combination of idasanutlin and venetoclax for treatment of p53 wild-type AML. The effect of idasanutlin and venetoclax combination on cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression was investigated in vitro using established AML cell lines. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models generated in female nude or non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. Mode-of-action analyses were performed by means of cell cycle kinetic studies, RNA sequencing as well as western blotting experiments. Combination treatment with venetoclax and idasanutlin results in synergistic anti-tumor activity compared with the respective single-agent treatments in vitro, in p53 wild-type AML cell lines, and leads to strongly superior efficacy in vivo, in subcutaneous and orthotopic AML models. The inhibitory effects of idasanutlin were cell-cycle dependent, with cells arresting in G1 in consecutive cycles and the induction of apoptosis only evident after cells had gone through at least two cell cycles. Combination treatment with venetoclax removed this dependency, resulting in an acceleration of cell death kinetics. As expected, gene expression studies using RNA sequencing showed significant alterations to pathways associated with p53 signaling and cell cycle arrest (CCND1 pathway) in response to idasanutlin treatment. Only few gene expression changes were observed for venetoclax treatment and combination treatment, indicating that their effects are mediated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Protein expression studies demonstrated that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 contributed to the activity of venetoclax and idasanutlin, with earlier inhibition of Mcl-1 in response to combination treatment contributing to the superior combined activity. The role of Mcl-1 was confirmed by small hairpin RNA gene knockdown studies. Our findings provide functional and molecular insight on the superior anti-tumor activity of combined idasanutlin and venetoclax treatment in AML and support its further exploration in clinical studies.",

Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is an important, multi-functional oncogenic protein and it has been well recognized for its negative regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. We discovered a novel mechanism of action of DIM, that it directly inhibits MDM2 in multiple colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. Treatment with DIM decreased MDM2 at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, inhibited cancer cell proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. DIM-induced decrease of MDM2 is p53-independent and is partly mediated by proteasome degradation of MDM2, as blocking of the proteasome activity reversed MDM2 protein inhibition. Overexpression of MDM2 blocked DIM's effects in growth suppression and apoptosis induction. When combined with imidazoline MDM2 inhibitors (Nutlin-3a and Idasanutlin/RG-7388), synergism was observed in cancer cell growth inhibition. In summary, our data support a new mechanism of action for DIM in direct inhibition of MDM2. The identification of MDM2 as a novel DIM target may help develop a new strategy in CRC prevention.",

The experiments here tested whether chronic stress enhances fear memory formation in female rats and whether the sensitized CORT response in chronic stress rats contributes to their enhanced fear memory. Studies first examined CORT responses to contextual fear conditioning in male and female rats and examined whether chronic stress enhanced the formation of contextual fear memories 24 h later. Studies then used metyrapone, a CORT synthesis inhibitor, to investigate whether blockade of plasma CORT would eliminate the chronic stress-induced enhancement in contextual fear memory. Results show that female rats have greater CORT responses than males, and chronic stress sensitizes the CORT response to fear conditioning in both sexes. However, female rats do not show enhanced contextual fear memory following chronic stress. Chronically stressed male rats show greater memory acquisition and show greater contextual fear memory 24 h later following fear conditioning.

Y1 mouse adrenocortical cells were treated with ACTH for up to 60 min to establish a cell model of corticosterone secretion. After treatment with different concentrations of GSE or ginsenoside monomers for 24 h prior to the addition of ACTH, analyses of cAMP content, PKA activity, and the levels of steroidogenesis regulators, melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R), and melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) in ACTH-induced Y1 cells were performed. We demonstrated that GSE inhibits ACTH-stimulated corticosterone production in Y1 cells by inhibiting factors critical for steroid synthesis. Ginsenoside Rd, an active ingredient of GSE, inhibits corticosterone secretion in the cells and impedes ACTH-induced corticosterone biosynthesis through down-regulation of proteins in the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. In addition, Western blot and qPCR analyses showed that ginsenoside Rd attenuated the induction of MC2R and MRAP by ACTH. Our findings indicate that ginsenoside Rd inhibits ACTH-induced corticosterone production through blockading the MC2R-cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in adrenocortical cells. Overall, this mechanism may represent an important therapeutic option for the treatment of stress-related disorders, further supporting the pharmacological benefits of ginseng.",

Using the same sampling design, paired, full-term, arterial, and venous umbilical cord samples and intrapartum chart records were obtained at the time of vaginal delivery (N = 167, 85 male) or emergency C-section (N = 38, 22 male). Eight steroids were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (adrenal glucocorticoids [cortisol, corticosterone], sequential cortisol precursor steroids [17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol], cortisol and corticosterone metabolites [cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone], and gonadal steroids [androstenedione, testosterone]). Fetal sex was not significant in any analytic models. Going through both phase 1 and phase 2 labor increased fetal adrenal steroidogenesis and decreased male testosterone relative to emergency C-sections that do not reach stage 2 of labor (ie, head compressions) and elective C-sections with no labor. Sum adrenal steroid molarity arriving in venous serum was almost double the equivalent metric for deliveries without labor. No effects of operative vaginal delivery were noted. Maternal regional anesthetic suppressed venous concentrations, and fetal synthesis replaced that steroid. Approximate molar equivalence between substrate pool depletion and net glucocorticoid synthesis was seen. Paired venous and arterial umbilical cord serum has the potential to identify sex differences that underlie antenatal programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in later life. However, stage 2 labor before the collection of serum, and regional anesthetic for the mother, mask those sex differences.",

In view of the finding that senescence is typically increased post\u2011irradiation, the present study examined whether ionizing radiation may cause kidney injury by enhancing premature senescence. The present study explored the relevance of the aging suppressor, Klotho, which has anti\u2011aging activity and is highly expressed in murine renal cells/kidney tissues, under irradiation conditions. Firstly, the effects of radiation on mouse inner medullary collecting duct\u20113 (mIMCD\u20113) cells and kidney tissues of mice were assessed. Subsequently, the mRNA expression levels of Klotho, TNF\u2011\u03b1 and ADAM metallopeptidase domain (ADAM)9/10/17 were analyzed by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR following exposure to radiation. In addition, the levels of these proteins were measured by western blotting or ELISA. The results revealed that irradiation of mIMCD\u20113 cells clearly triggered cellular senescence. Notably, Klotho gene expression was considerably decreased in radiation\u2011exposed mIMCD\u20113 cells and in the kidney tissues of irradiated BALB/c mice, and the corresponding translated protein was consistently expressed following radiation exposure. Moreover, expression of TNF\u2011\u03b1, a negative regulator of Klotho, was significantly increased, whereas ADAM9/10/17, an ectodomain shedding enzyme of Klotho, was decreased in irradiated mIMCD\u20113 cells and in the kidney tissues of BALB/c mice. Collectively, these data suggested that TNF\u2011\u03b1\u2011mediated inhibition of Klotho expression and blockage of soluble Klotho formation via decreased ADAM expression following irradiation may contribute to the development of renal dysfunction through acceleration of radiation\u2011induced cellular senescence.",

Renal expression of klotho is diminished in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In the present study, the effects of klotho supplementation on PKD were assessed. Recombinant human klotho protein (10 \u03bcg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>) or a vehicle was administered daily by subcutaneous injection to 6-wk-old mice with PKD (DBA/2-pcy). Blood pressure was measured using tail-cuff methods. After 2 mo, mice were killed, and the kidneys were harvested for analysis. Exogenous klotho protein supplementation reduced kidney weight, cystic area, systolic blood pressure, renal angiotensin II levels, and 8-epi-PGF<sub>2\u03b1</sub> excretion (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Klotho protein supplementation enhanced glomerular filtration rate, renal expression of superoxide dismutase, and klotho itself (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Klotho supplementation attenuated renal expressions of TGF-\u03b2 and collagen type I and diminished renal abundance of Twist, phosphorylated Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Pathological examination revealed that klotho decreased the fibrosis index and nuclear staining of Smad in PKD kidneys (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Our data indicate that klotho protein supplementation ameliorates the renin-angiotensin system, reducing blood pressure in PKD mice. Furthermore, the present results implicate klotho supplementation in the suppression of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, slowing cystic expansion. Finally, our findings suggest that klotho protein supplementation attenuated fibrosis at least partly by inhibiting epithelial mesenchymal transition in PKD.",

One of the crucial symptoms is pulmonary emphysema, although \u03b1-Klotho is not expressed in the lungs. \u03b1-Klotho secreted from the kidneys is probably involved in the pathology of emphysema because kidney-specific knockout mice exhibit emphysematous structural changes. We examined whether any glycan changes in \u03b1-Klotho mouse lungs were observed, because \u03b1-Klotho is reported to have glycosidase activity. Here, we found the accumulation of heparan sulphate in the microsomal fraction of \u03b1-Klotho mouse lungs. Meanwhile, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) expression was decreased in \u03b1-Klotho mice. From these results, it is thought that the increase in heparan sulphate is due to insufficient cleavage of the core protein by ADAM17. Additionally, a reduction in \u03b1-Klotho and a decline of ADAM17 were also observed both in normal aged mice and in senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) knockout mice, a mouse model of premature ageing. Thus, the decrease in ADAM17 is caused by the reduction in \u03b1-Klotho. These may be involved in the deterioration of lung function during ageing and may be associated with the pathology of pulmonary emphysema.",

Klotho functions as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) signaling, whereas its shed extracellular domain, soluble Klotho (sKlotho), carrying glycosidase activity, is a humoral factor that regulates renal health. Low sKlotho in CKD is associated with disease progression, and sKlotho supplementation has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for managing CKD. Here, we explored the structure-function relationship and post-translational modifications of sKlotho variants to guide the future design of sKlotho-based therapeutics. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)- and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-derived WT sKlotho proteins had varied activities in FGF23 co-receptor and \u03b2-glucuronidase assays <i>in vitro</i> and distinct properties <i>in vivo</i> Sialidase treatment of heavily sialylated CHO-sKlotho increased its co-receptor activity 3-fold, yet it remained less active than hyposialylated HEK-sKlotho.

Moreover, the introduction of two catalytic glutamate residues conserved across glycosidases into sKlotho enhanced its glucuronidase activity but decreased its FGF23 co-receptor activity, suggesting that these two functions might be structurally divergent. These findings open up opportunities for rational engineering of pharmacologically enhanced sKlotho therapeutics for managing kidney disease.",

Can short-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) contribute to the reduction of ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury by enhancing the levels of Klotho and its related axes, including myocardial TRPC6 expression, and antioxidant defence as novel possible mechanisms of exercise-induced cadioprotection (EICP) against IR injury? What is the main finding and its importance? The increase of plasma and myocardial levels of Klotho as a result of preconditioning with HIIT and prevention of a significant reduction of Klotho during IR injury can promote cardioprotection and reduce damage by attenuating myocardial TRPC6 expression and increasing antioxidant defence. The present findings may provide a new mechanism in EICP and IR injury, and provide the knowledge to develop preventive and therapeutic approaches. Cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery disease, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, and ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) insult is the main pathological cause leading to death. Exercise training is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and the development of cardioprotection against IR injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of preconditioning with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on myocardial and plasma levels of Klotho and its related axes as novel mechanisms of exercise-induced cardioprotection against IR injury. Seventy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of control, HIIT, sham, IR and HIIT group that underwent IR injury (H-IR). The training group performed five sessions of HIIT on the treadmill. The cardiac IR injury was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 24 h reperfusion. Infarct size and histopathological assessment of cardiac tissues were determined through Evans Blue-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and haematoxylin-eosin staining, respectively. We investigated lipid peroxidation and markers of cardiac injury, antioxidant enzymes and the plasma levels of Klotho using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Also, myocardial levels of Klotho and TRPC6 expression were determined by western blot assays. The results demonstrated a significant increase in myocardial and plasma levels of Klotho following HIIT and a significant decrease during IR injury. Myocardial TRPC6 channel expression increased following IR. HIIT also prevented a significant reduction of Klotho during IR and consequently reduced the expression of the TRPC6 channel in the H-IR group compared with the IR group. Furthermore, HIIT decreased the infarct size, cardiac injury, lipid peroxidation, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase myocardial band and cardiac troponin-I, and improved total antioxidant capacity and catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities following IR injury. The findings of the present study suggest that HIIT improves cardioprotection against IR injury and reduces cardiac damages through an increase in myocardial and plasma levels of Klotho and its related axes (TRPC6 and antioxidant defence). These findings can help to develop preventive and therapeutic approaches.",

Klotho is an anti-aging protein expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Klotho protects against the development of several neurodegenerative diseases. Simvastatin is a lipophilic statin that can enhance klotho expression. This study was designed to investigate cerebellar structural changes in diabetes, klotho expression in the cerebellum of diabetic rats and the neuroprotective effect of simvastatin. 24 adult albino rats were divided into 4 groups; control, simvastatin, diabetic (induced by single intraperitoneal injection of STZ 45 mg/kg) and diabetic treated by simvastatin (10 mg/kg once daily) after confirmation of diabetes. Rotarod test was performed for evaluation of motor coordination. Blood glucose and insulin levels were estimated for confirmation of diabetes. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and malonaldehyde (MDA) in cerebellar tissues were evaluated. The cerebellar samples were prepared for histological and immunohistochemical staining. The latency time on the rotarod was reduced in diabetic rats. Cerebellar structure was disturbed in diabetic group. Oxidative stress was evidenced by increased MDA and reduced GSH. Klotho expression was downregulated and caspase-3 was increased in diabetes. Simvastatin increased the latency time. Simvastatin diminished the changes in oxidative stress markers and succeeded to ameliorate the diabetic induced cerebellar changes. Simvastatin enhanced Klotho and diminished Caspase-3 expression. Simvastatin can ameliorate diabetic induced cerebellar changes through minimizing oxidative stress, enhancement of Klotho expression and reduction of apoptosis.",

Klotho, known as an anti-ageing protein, has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Klotho is expressed in limited tissues including the lens. Here we examined whether klotho expression is decreased in diabetic lens and, if so, whether klotho treatment can prevent diabetic cataract formation. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and age-matched control rats were treated with vehicle or klotho protein, starting at 1 week after STZ injection. Twelve weeks after treatment, cataract formation was observed in diabetic rats but not control rats. Cataract formation and scores were significantly less in klotho-treated diabetic rats than vehicle-treated diabetic rats. Levels of klotho in plasma, aqueous humor and lens were significantly decreased in vehicle-treated diabetic rats, compared with control rats, but were restored in klotho-treated diabetic rats. Additionally, vehicle-treated diabetic rats had increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the lens, which were associated with decreased antioxidant transcriptional master regulator Nrf2 activity and increased transcription factor NF-\u03baB activity. All of these findings were ameliorated in klotho-treated diabetic rats. Notably, klotho treatment did not alter blood glucose in diabetic rats. These results indicate that klotho reduction may increase susceptibility of the lens to oxidative and inflammatory insults, promoting cataract formation under diabetic conditions. Klotho treatment can ameliorate the onset and progression of diabetic cataract via enhancing Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defense and suppressing NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses. Klotho in the lens may be a novel therapeutic target for prevention of cataract formation in diabetes.",

The antiaging, life-extending, and cognition-enhancing protein Klotho is neuroprotective due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and pro-myelinating effects. In addition, Klotho is also a tumor suppressor and has beneficial roles in multiple organs. Klotho is downregulated as part of the aging process. Thus, upregulating Klotho in the brain may lead to novel therapeutics to people suffering or at risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. We attempted to upregulate Klotho for its beneficial effects in the brain and elsewhere. Here, we describe a method to specifically activate Klotho gene expression. To accomplish this task, we designed zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) targeting within -300 bps of the human Klotho promoter. We designed the ZPF constructs either de novo from modular building blocks, or modified sequences from the natural endogenous Egr1 transcription factor backbone structure. Egr1 is known to upregulate Klotho expression. We tested the transcriptional activation effects of these ZFPs in a dual luciferase coincidence reporter system under the control of 4-kb promoter of human Klotho in stable HEK293 cells and in HK-2 cells that express Klotho protein endogenously. We found that the best ZFPs are the de novo designed ones targeting -250 bps of Klotho promoter and one of the Egr1-binding sites. We further enhanced Klotho's activation using p65-Rta transcriptional activation domains in addition to VP64. These upregulation approaches could be useful for studying Klotho's protective effects and designing Klotho boosting therapeutics for future in vivo experiments.",

The relationships among key regulators of phosphate metabolism are still being investigated. FGF-23, the humoral factor involved in phosphate metabolism, is strongly associated with serum phosphorus level. Klotho, a transmembrane protein expressed primarily in renal tubules, functions as an obligatory co-receptor for FGF-23. The soluble form of Klotho, produced by the shedding of the transmembrane protein, is detectable in body fluids. The purpose of the study was to assess if serum soluble alpha-Klotho level was related to phosphate metabolism parameters and residual renal function (RRF) in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Thirty-five clinically stable patients 4 to 6 weeks after the onset of PD were included in the study. For each patient, clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Serum phosphorus concentration, urinary and peritoneal phosphate clearance, serum FGF-23 and soluble Klotho protein concentrations were determined. Serum soluble alpha-Klotho was strongly negatively correlated with 24-hour diuresis (Rs = -0.55, p = 0.004) and renal phosphate clearance (Rs = -0.40, p = 0.049), but not with RRF.

Thus, we hypothesized that Klotho expressed in BMSCs could increase the renal protective effects of BMSCs. To verify the hypothesis, we isolated BMSCs from C57BL/6 mice, transfected them with Klotho-GFP-adenovirus and investigated the change in BMSC proliferation. We then transplanted Klotho-GFP-BMSCs into mice with AKI and investigated the therapeutic effect compared with that of sham-treated mice and GFP-BMSC-transplanted mice. Kidney fibrosis after ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) was relieved by BMSC transplantation, and the antifibrotic effect of BMSCs was significantly enhanced by overexpressing the Klotho gene. Mechanistic studies showed that Klotho increased pluripotency gene expression in BMSCs. Klotho produced by Klotho-GFP-BMSCs inhibited the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Klotho-GFP-BMSCs showed increased proliferative ability and more potent immuno-regulation ability than did GFP-BMSCs.

We evaluated serial changes in serum Klotho levels among living donors before and after retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy as well as in their renal transplant recipients. The levels of soluble Klotho in serum obtained from 10 living donors and their renal transplant recipients were determined using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. Serum soluble Klotho was detectable in all subjects. The baseline serum Klotho concentrations in the living donors ranged from 726.4 to 1417.1 pg/mL (median, 909.8 pg/mL; interquartile ranges [IR], 754.8-1132.4), whereas that in the concomitant renal transplant recipients ranged from 397.5 to 1047.2 pg/mL (median, 613.0 pg/mL; IR, 445.9-750.8; P = .003). The levels of soluble serum Klotho measured 5 days after retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (median, 619.0 pg/mL; IR, 544.6-688.5; P = .001) were significantly lower than the baseline values. Among the renal transplant recipients, no significant changes in serum Klotho levels were observed during the observation period. Our data regarding soluble serum Klotho levels obtained from living donors support the idea that the kidneys are a major source of soluble serum Klotho in human subjects without a deterioration of renal function. In recipients, concomitant acute kidney injuries and immunosuppressive protocols might modulate the release of soluble Klotho from the grafts into the circulation.",

To this end, cRNA encoding KCNQ1/KCNE1 was injected in Xenopus oocytes with or without additional injection of cRNA encoding Klotho. KCNQ1/KCNE1 expressing oocytes were treated with human recombinant Klotho protein (30 ng/mL) for 24 h. Moreover, oocytes which express both KCNQ1/KCNE1 and Klotho were treated with 10 \u03bcM DSA L (D-saccharic acid-1,4-lactone), a \u03b2-glucuronidase inhibitor. The KCNQ1/KCNE1 depolarization-induced current (I(Ks)) was determined utilizing dual electrode voltage clamp, while KCNQ1/KCNE1 protein abundance in the cell membrane was visualized utilizing specific antibody binding and quantified by chemiluminescence.

The present study aimed to investigate the putative roles of klotho in angiotensin (Ang) II-induced damage of renal tubular epithelial cells. NRK-52E rat cells were treated with various combinations of Ang II, the Ang-converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril (Fos) and the Ang II receptor antagonist valsartan (Val). The levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, soluble klotho, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and E-cadherin in NRK-52E culture supernatants were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-\u03b21, klotho, \u03b1-SMA and E-cadherin was detected using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that Ang II inhibited the expression of klotho and E-cadherin, while it upregulated the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA, in NRK52E cells. Fos and/or Val were revealed to enhance klotho and E-cadherin expression, and suppress the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA, compared with the Ang II-only group. Furthermore, a positive linear correlation was detected between the expression of klotho and E-cadherin, while negative linear correlations with klotho expression were detected for TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA expression.

At 40 weeks old, the survival rate was approximately 30% in ICGN mice, and approximately 70% in the ICGN/klTG group. This improvement was associated with dramatic improvement in renal functions, morphological lesions, and cytochrome c oxidase activity but a reduction in beta-galactosidase activity (a senescence-associated protein), mitochondrial DNA fragmentation, superoxide anion generation, lipid peroxidation, and Bax protein expression and apoptosis.

The present study explored the putative impact of Klotho on eryptosis. According to Fluo3 fluorescence, cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration was significantly larger in klotho(-/-) erythrocytes as compared to klotho(+/+) erythrocytes.

In order to induce acidosis, acetazolamide was added to drinking water (0.8 g/l) of kl/kl and wild-type mice. As a result, acetazolamide treatment of kl/kl mice partially reversed the growth deficit, tripled the life span, almost completely reversed the calcifications in trachea, lung, kidney, stomach, intestine, and vascular tissues, the excessive aortic alkaline phosphatase mRNA levels and the plasma concentrations of osteoprotegerin, osteopontin as well as fetuin-A, without significantly decreasing FGF23, 1,25(OH)2D3, Ca(2+), and phosphate plasma concentrations. In primary human aortic smooth muscle cells, acidotic environment prevented phosphate-induced alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression. The present study reveals a completely novel effect of acetazolamide, i.e., interference with osteoinductive signaling and tissue calcification in kl/kl mice. Klotho deficient (kl/kl) mice suffer from hyperphosphatemia with dramatic tissue calcification. Acetazolamide (ACM) treatment partially reversed the growth deficit of kl/kl mice. In kl/kl mice, ACM reversed tissue calcification despite continued hyperphosphatemia. ACM tripled the life span of kl/kl mice. In human aortic smooth muscle cells, low extracellular pH prevented osteogenic signaling.",

Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone that controls sodium-phosphate transporter and 1-alpha 25(OH) vitamin D hydroxylase expression in the renal proximal tubule. FGF23 is synthesized by bone cells in response to an increase in serum phosphate or calcitriol concentrations. The binding of FGF23 to a FGF receptor requires a protein named Klotho that is expressed in the kidney in the distal but not in the proximal tubule. The mechanism by which FGF23 controls proximal tubule function remains to be established. The alteration of the FGF23-Klotho axis in animal models and various human disorders is associated with abnormal control of body phosphate content confirming the major role played by these protein in phosphate homeostasis. This review details FGF23 and Klotho functions in normal conditions and in genetics or acquired disorders.",

Klotho, an anti-aging gene, is mainly expressed in the brain and kidney. The roles of Klotho in the brain and kidney during aerobic exercise remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to determine whether aerobic exercise could influence the expression of Klotho, decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prolong life span. Sprague Dawley rats were exercised on a motor treadmill. Klotho mRNA and protein expression levels in rat brain and kidney tissues were examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. ROS production was detected following intermittent aerobic exercise (IAE) or continuous aerobic exercise (CAE). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that aerobic exercise significantly improved rat survival (P&lt;0.001). The ROS levels in rat brain and kidney tissues were decreased in the aerobic exercise groups compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05). In addition, Klotho mRNA and protein expression levels were increased significantly following aerobic exercise compared with controls (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between the IAE and CAE groups in any experiments (P&gt;0.05). These results suggest that aerobic exercise-stimulated Klotho upregulation extends the life span by attenuating the excess production of ROS in the brain and kidney. As Klotho exhibits a potential anti-aging effect, promoting Klotho expression through aerobic exercise may be a novel approach for the prevention and treatment of aging and aging-related diseases.",

In its shed form, Klotho exerts anti-fibrotic effects in several tissues. Klotho-deficient mice spontaneously develop fibrosis and Klotho deficiency exacerbates the disease progression in fibrotic animal models. Furthermore, Klotho overexpression or supplementation protects against fibrosis in various models of renal and cardiac fibrotic disease. These effects are mediated at least partially by the direct inhibitory effects of soluble Klotho on TGF\u03b21 signaling, Wnt signaling, and FGF2 signaling. Soluble Klotho, as present in the circulation, appears to be the primary mediator of anti-fibrotic effects. Similarly, through inhibition of the TGF\u03b21, Wnt, FGF2, and IGF1 signaling pathways, Klotho also inhibits tumorigenesis. The Klotho promoter gene is generally hypermethylated in cancer, and overexpression or supplementation of Klotho has been found to inhibit tumor growth in various animal models. This review focuses on the protective effects of soluble Klotho in inhibiting renal fibrosis and fibrosis in distant organs secondary to renal Klotho deficiency. We also discuss the structure-function relationships of Klotho domains and biological effects in the context of potential targeted treatment strategies.",

We used this model to investigate sensorineural hearing loss from the point of view that it may be considered an issue of aging. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, we were able to confirm klotho gene transcription and protein synthesis in the kidney and inner ear. Klotho protein was mainly expressed in the stria vascularis and spiral ligament of the inner ear and in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, likely serving a common function in the two organs, i.e., modulating ion transport. The threshold for the auditory brainstem response was significantly higher in Klotho mice than in wild-type mice, and wave I latencies were prolonged. On the other hand, Klotho mice exhibited a normal distribution of I-IV interpeak intervals. No obvious morphological abnormalities were detected in Klotho mice, although no expression of Klotho protein was detected, and there was an apparent hearing disorder. Taken together, these findings suggest that by contributing to the maintenance ion homeostasis in the endolymph, Klotho protein serves as a key mediator of auditory function.",

The Klotho protein exists in two forms, a full-length membrane form and a soluble secreted form. The extracellular domain of Klotho can be enzymatically cleaved off and released into the systemic circulation where it acts as \u03b2-glucuronidase and a hormone. Soluble Klotho can be found in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and the urine of mammals. Klotho deficiency results in early appearance of multiple age-related disorders and premature death, whereas overexpression of Klotho exerts the opposite effect. Klotho may influence cellular transport processes across the cell membrane by inhibiting calcitriol (1,25(OH) (2)D(3)), formation or by directly affecting transporter proteins, including ion channels, carriers and pumps. Accordingly, Klotho protein is a powerful regulator of transport mechanisms across the cell membrane. Klotho regulates diverse calcium and potassium ion channels, as well as several carriers including the Na(+)-coupled excitatory amino acid transporters EAAT3 and EAAT4, the Na(+)-coupled phosphate cotransporters, NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIb, and a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. All those cellular transport regulations contribute in the aging suppressor role of Klotho. Future studies will help to determine if the Klotho protein regulates cell-surface expression of other transport proteins and is affecting underlying mechanisms.",

Plasma klotho was measured in 774 participants aged \u226565 years enrolled in InCHIANTI, a prospective cohort study comprising Italian adults. Frailty status was assessed at 3 and 6 years after enrollment. Frailty was defined as presence of at least three out of five criteria of unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, sedentariness, muscle weakness, and slow walking speed; prefrailty was defined as presence of one or two criteria; and robustness was defined as zero criteria. We assessed whether plasma klotho concentrations measured at the 3-year visit related to frailty. Each additional natural logarithm of klotho (pg/mL) was associated with lower odds of frailty versus robustness after adjustment for covariates (odds ratio [OR] 0.46; 95% confidence interval 0.21, 0.98; p-value = .045). Higher klotho was particularly associated with lower odds of exhaustion (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.36, 0.89; p-value = .014). Participants with higher klotho also had lower estimated odds of weight loss and weakness, but these findings were not statistically significant. Higher plasma klotho concentrations were associated with lower likelihoods of frailty and particularly exhaustion. Future studies should investigate modifiable mechanisms through which klotho may affect the frailty syndrome.",

In humans, the klotho level decreases with age whereas the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases with age. Diabetic nephropathy is the most common form of CKD, which leads to end-stage renal disease. A decrease in klotho has been found in kidneys of patients with diabetic nephropathy. The purpose of this study is to assess whether klotho gene deficiency affects early diabetic nephropathy in a mouse of model of type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Male KL(+/-) mutant and wild-type mice (6-8 weeks) were injected with multiple low doses of STZ. Renal functions and renal blood flow were assessed. Kidneys were collected for histological examination and molecular assays of TGF\u03b21 and mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Klotho deficiency in KL(+/-) mutant mice exacerbated STZ-induced increases in urine albumin, blood urea nitrogen, expansion of mesangial matrix in renal glomeruli, and kidney hypertrophy, suggesting a protective role of klotho in kidney function and structure. Klotho deficiency did not affect renal blood flow. Notably, klotho deficiency significantly increased phosphorylation of Smad2, indicating enhanced TGF\u03b21 signaling in kidneys. Klotho deficiency also increased phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 (a downstream effector of mTOR), indicating enhanced mTOR signaling in kidneys of early diabetic mice. Thus, klotho gene deficiency may make kidneys more susceptible to diabetic injury. Klotho gene deficiency exacerbated early diabetic nephropathy via enhancing both TGF\u03b21 and mTOR signaling in kidneys.",

Conversely, overexpression of klotho extends mouse lifespan. Klotho is most abundant in kidney and expressed in a limited number of other organs, including the brain, where klotho levels are highest in choroid plexus. Reports vary on where klotho is expressed within the brain parenchyma, and no data is available as to whether klotho levels change across postnatal development. We used in situ hybridization to map klotho mRNA expression in the developing and adult rat brain and report moderate, widespread expression across grey matter regions. mRNA expression levels in cortex, hippocampus, caudate putamen, and amygdala decreased during the second week of life and then gradually rose to adult levels by postnatal day 21. Immunohistochemistry revealed a protein expression pattern similar to the mRNA results, with klotho protein expressed widely throughout the brain. Klotho protein co-localized with both the neuronal marker NeuN, as well as, oligodendrocyte marker olig2.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21496980": "The klotho gene (KL) was identified first as a putative aging-suppressor gene that extended life span when overexpressed and accelerated aging-like phenotypes when disrupted in mice. It encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein and is expressed predominantly in kidney, where it functions as an obligate coreceptor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). FGF-23 is a bone-derived hormone that suppresses phosphate reabsorption and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (vitamin D) synthesis in the kidney. Klotho also is expressed in the parathyroid gland, where FGF-23 decreases parathyroid hormone expression and secretion, further suppressing vitamin D synthesis in kidney. Thus, FGF-23 functions as a phosphaturic hormone and a counter-regulatory hormone for vitamin D, thereby inducing negative phosphate balance. Mice lacking either FGF-23 or Klotho show hyperphosphatemia in addition to developing multiple aging-like phenotypes, which can be rescued by resolving phosphate retention. These findings have unveiled an unexpected link between aging and phosphate. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), phosphate retention is seen universally and has been associated with increased mortality risk. Patients with CKD have high serum FGF-23 levels with decreased klotho expression in the kidney and parathyroid, rendering FGF-23 and Klotho as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CKD. The Klotho protein not only serves as a coreceptor for FGF-23, but also functions as a humoral factor. Klotho's extracellular domain is released into blood and urine by ectodomain shedding and exerts various functions independently of FGF-23, including regulation of multiple ion channels and transporters. Decreased urinary Klotho protein level has been identified as one of the earliest biomarkers of CKD progression. This review focuses on the current understanding of Klotho protein function, with emphasis on its potential involvement in the pathophysiologic process of CKD.",

Klotho mRNA, however, is expressed only in brain, kidney, reproductive organs, pituitary gland, and parathyroid gland. Therefore it remains to be elucidated how lack of Klotho protein in these limited organs leads to the variety of phenotypes. To shed light on mechanisms by which Klotho protein acts on distant targets, we examined localization of Klotho protein in brain, kidney, and reproductive organs, and analyzed brain and kidney in kl-/- mice searching for changes in target regions in these organs. In brain, Klotho proteins were localized at choroid plexus, where the proteins were dominantly localized at the apical plasma membrane of ependymal cells. In kl-/- brain, reduction of synapses was evident in hippocampus, suggesting a role of Klotho as a humoral factor in cerebrospinal fluid. Klotho proteins in kidney localized at distal renal tubules. Interestingly, in kl-/-mice, type IIa Na/phosphate (Pi) cotransporters, which function at the proximal renal tubules in reabsorption of phosphate ions, were translocated. This suggests that Klotho protein in kidney is implicated in calcium homeostasis which regulates localization of type IIa Na/Pi cotransporters via parathyroid hormone (PTH). Klotho proteins in reproductive organs were expressed only in mature germ cells, although in kl-/- mice germ cell maturation was arrested at earlier stages. Thus, Klotho proteins not only function as a humoral factor, but also are implicated in hormonal regulation, which may explain why mutation of klotho gene results in a variety of phenotypes.",

Exhaustive exercise has been reported to result in tissue damage, which is induced by inflammation, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism disturbance. However, little is known about the effects of exhaustive exercise on the expression of \u03b1-klotho in various tissues. To determine the effects, the treadmill exhaustion test in mice was performed and the mice were sacrificed at different time points following exhaustive exercise. Our results confirmed that the full-length (130 kDa) and shorter-form (65 kDa) \u03b1-klotho were primarily expressed in the kidneys. Moreover, we found that, except for the kidneys and brain, other tissues primarily expressed the shorter-form \u03b1-klotho, including liver, which was in contrast to previous reports. Furthermore, the shorter-form \u03b1-klotho was decreased immediately following the acute exhaustive exercise and was then restored to the pre-exercise level or even higher levels in the next few days.

However, our knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms of aging has been limited. We recently developed a unique short lifespan mouse strain in which a single gene mutation caused multiple aging-related disorders and identified the responsible gene as klotho. The most characteristic phenotypes seem to be caused by abnormalities in calcium metabolism. Furthermore, the klotho gene is expressed principally in the important tissues for calcium homeostasis such as distal tubule cells of the kidney, choroid plexus in the brain, and the main cells of the parathyroid gland. Klotho plays a critical role for the regulation of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis by negatively regulating the synthesis of active Vitamin D. The deficiency of the klotho gene results in degradation of cells by the activation of calcium-dependent proteolysis in kidney, lung and heart. Importantly, the increased activation of calcium-dependent proteolysis occurs in the tissues of old mice together with the down regulation of klotho gene expression. What is Klotho protein required for and how does it act? In this review, I will discuss our working hypotheses on the biological roles and molecular functions of Klotho protein.",

Perplexing and difficult problems remain unresolved, e.g. whether the variability in manifestations is due to variable expressions of steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 or to effects of testosterone itself. It is also imperative to establish whether defects in steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2, perhaps in the heterozygous state, are responsible for a portion of cases of sporadic hypospadias, to determine whether 5 alpha-reductase plays a role in progesterone action in women, and to elucidate the relation between androgen action and gender role behavior.",

Mediation of the effects of both testosterone and DHT requires a functional androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasmic compartment of target cells. DHT (or testosterone) binding induces a conformational change which facilitates AR nuclear transport, phosphorylation and dimerization, ultimately regulating of the rate of transcription of androgen-dependent genes. Any event which impairs DHT formation (mutation within the 5alphaR-2 gene or 5alphaR-2 inhibitors) or normal function of the AR (mutation in the AR gene, antiandrogens) may result in insufficient androgen action in the male fetus and in subsequent undervirilization in the newborn. Hypospadias may be due to a defect in androgen action due to mutation of the 5alphaR-2 or of the AR gene. Mutation of unidentified genes is likely to underlie this displacement of the urethral meatus from the tip to the ventral side of the phallus. An aetiological role for environmental chemical products has been postulated, since ethnic as well as geographical differences in the incidence of hypospadias have been noted. Increasing evidence has been gathered indicating that widely used industrial and agricultural chemicals have deleterious effects on normal male sexual differentiation. Cryptorchidism and micropenis may represent an intersex phenotype, even if they are isolated. Aetiological factors include 5alphaR-2 gene mutation, AR gene mutation or environmental hormonal disruptors. In conclusion, several phenotypes have been attributed to insufficient androgen action during fetal life. Whereas mutations in the 5alphaR-2 gene and AR gene are natural, attention should be focused on environmental endocrine disruptors that are able to mimic steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.",

T/DHT-ratios were highly increased ( &gt; 50) in the classical syndrome (SRD type 5), but variable in the less severe affected patients (SRD types 1-4) (14-35). Mutations in the SRD5A2 gene had been characterized using PCR-SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing. A small deletion was encountered in two patients, while all other patients had single base mutations which result in amino acid substitutions. We conclude that phenotypes may vary widely in patients with SRD5A2 gene mutations spanning the whole range from completely female to normal male without distinctive clinical signs of the disease. Hence, steroid 5 alpha-reductase deficiency should be considered not only in sex reversed patients with female or ambiguous phenotypes, but also in those with mild symptoms of undermasculinization as encountered in patients with hypospadias and/or micropenis. A classification based on the severity of the masculinization defect may be used for correlation of phenotypes with enzyme activities and genotypes, and for comparisons of phenotypes between different patients as the basis for clinical decisions to be made in patients with pseudohermaphroditism due to steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency.",

Molecular studies of the SRD5A2 revealed a new heterozygous gene variant within the coding region that results in phenotypic expression. A c.92C&gt;T transition changing serine to phenylalanine at codon 31 of exon 1 (p.Ser31Phe) was identified in a patient with 46,XY disorder of sexual development who displayed glandular hypospadias with micropenis and bilateral cryptorchidism. The restoration of the p.Ser31Phe mutation by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays using cultured HEK-293 cells showed that this novel substitution does not abolish but does deregulate the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Thus, the maximum velocity (V max) value was higher for the mutant enzyme (22.5 \u00b1 6.9 nmol DHT mg protein(-1) h(-1)) than for the wild-type enzyme (9.8 \u00b1 2.0 nmol DHT mg protein(-1) h(-1)). Increased in vitro activity of the p.Ser31Phe mutant suggested an activating effect. This case provides evidence that heterozygous missense mutations in SRD5A2 may induce the abnormal development of male external genitalia.",

Dispensing data on drug combinations involving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants could help to identify areas for intensified medical education. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of individual dispensing data regarding all individuals &gt; or =15 years old in Sweden. The study analysed the prescribing and dispensing of CYP2D6 drugs (metoprolol, donepezil, galantamine, codeine, tamoxifen) together with CYP2D6-blocking SSRIs (paroxetine/fluoxetine) or SSRIs without significant CYP2D6 inhibition (citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline), and the related prescribing of CYP2D6-independent comparator drugs (atenolol, rivastigmine, propoxyphene, anastrozole). Odds were calculated between each CYP2D6 drug and the corresponding comparator drug in patients on fluoxetine/paroxetine and citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated by dividing the obtained odds in patients on fluoxetine/paroxetine by the corresponding odds in patients on citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline. Compared with patients that were dispensed citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline, patients dispensed fluoxetine/paroxetine had lower prescribing rates of metoprolol (adjusted OR 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.76, 0.85), donepezil (0.65; 0.49, 0.86) and galantamine (0.58; 0.41, 0.81). In contrast, the use of prodrugs codeine (compared woth propoxyphene) or tamoxifen (compared with anastrozole) was similar among patients on fluoxetine/paroxetine and citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline (adjusted OR 1.03; 0.94, 1.12 and 1.29; 0.96, 1.73, respectively).

Accurately differentiating between breast cancer sub-types is an important part of clinical decision-making. Although this problem has been addressed using machine learning methods in the past, there remains unexplained heterogeneity within the established sub-types that cannot be resolved by the commonly used classification algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, called DeepTRIAGE (Deep learning for the TRactable Individualised Analysis of Gene Expression), which uses an attention mechanism to obtain personalised biomarker scores that describe how important each gene is in predicting the cancer sub-type for each sample. We then perform a principal component analysis of these biomarker scores to visualise the sample heterogeneity, and use a linear model to test whether the major principal axes associate with known clinical phenotypes. Our model not only classifies cancer sub-types with good accuracy, but simultaneously assigns each patient their own set of interpretable and individualised biomarker scores. These personalised scores describe how important each feature is in the classification of any patient, and can be analysed post-hoc to generate new hypotheses about latent heterogeneity. We apply the DeepTRIAGE framework to classify the gene expression signatures of luminal A and luminal B breast cancer sub-types, and illustrate its use for genes as well as the GO and KEGG gene sets. Using DeepTRIAGE, we calculate personalised biomarker scores that describe the most important features for classifying an individual patient as luminal A or luminal B. In doing so, DeepTRIAGE simultaneously reveals heterogeneity within the luminal A biomarker scores that significantly associate with tumour stage, placing all luminal samples along a continuum of severity.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31776270": "An important site for bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) latency is sensory neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG). The synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone consistently induces BoHV-1 reactivation from latency. Expression of four Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factors (KLF), i.e., KLF4, KLF6, PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger), and KLF15, are induced in TG neurons early during dexamethasone-induced reactivation. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and KLF15 form a feed-forward transcription loop that cooperatively transactivates the BoHV-1 immediate early transcription unit 1 (IEtu1) promoter that drives bovine infected cell protein 0 (bICP0) and bICP4 expression. Since the bICP0 gene also contains a separate early (E) promoter, we tested the hypothesis that GR and KLF family members transactivate the bICP0 E promoter. GR and KLF4, both pioneer transcription factors, cooperated to stimulate bICP0 E promoter activity in a ligand-independent manner in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2A). Furthermore, GR and KLF4 stimulated productive infection. Mutating both half GR binding sites did not significantly reduce GR- and KLF4-mediated transactivation of the bICP0 E promoter, suggesting that a novel mechanism exists for transactivation. GR and KLF15 cooperatively stimulated bICP0 activity less efficiently than GR and KL4: however, KLF6, PLZF, and GR had little effect on the bICP0 E promoter. GR, KLF4, and KLF15 occupied bICP0 E promoter sequences in transfected Neuro-2A cells. GR and KLF15, but not KLF4, occupied the bICP0 E promoter at late times during productive infection of bovine cells. Collectively, these studies suggest that cooperative transactivation of the bICP0 E promoter by two pioneer transcription factors (GR and KLF4) correlates with stimulating lytic cycle viral gene expression following stressful stimuli.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), an important bovine pathogen, establishes lifelong latency in sensory neurons. Reactivation from latency is consistently induced by the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone. We predict that increased corticosteroid levels activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Consequently, viral gene expression is stimulated by the activated GR. The immediate early transcription unit 1 promoter (IEtu1) drives expression of two viral transcriptional regulatory proteins, bovine infected cell protein 0 (bICP0) and bICP4. Interestingly, a separate early promoter also drives bICP0 expression. Two pioneer transcription factors, GR and Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factor 4 (KLF4), cooperatively transactivate the bICP0 early (E) promoter. GR and KLF15 cooperate to stimulate bICP0 E promoter activity but significantly less than GR and KLF4. The bICP0 E promoter contains enhancer-like domains necessary for GR- and KLF4-mediated transactivation that are distinct from those for GR and KLF15. Stress-induced pioneer transcription factors are proposed to activate key viral promoters, including the bICP0 E promoter, during early stages of reactivation from latency.",

Structurally, its ligand binding domain (LBD) harbors the region for the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function 2 (AF-2), a majorly hydrophobic groove formed by residues from helices H3, H4, and H12, where the H12 position plays a critical role in AF-2 spatial conformation and GR function as a whole. However, the exact mechanisms underlying how regulatory ligands control the H12 structure and dynamics are yet to be elucidated. In this work, we have explored the correlation between ligand identity and GR LBD H12 behavior through different molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After building diverse GR LBD systems in agonist and nonagonist states, we studied each system's response in the absence or the presence of an agonist ligand (dexamethasone) or an antagonist ligand (RU486) using classical MD simulations. We complemented them with steered MD for assessing the transition between those states and with the Umbrella Sampling method for free-energy evaluation. On the one hand, successfully obtaining fully folded nonagonist GR LBD states from the partially unfolded crystal GR LBD/RU486 underlines the role of the H1 in the GR LBD folding pathway. On the other hand, our results describe the H12 as a dynamic ensemble of conformations whose relative population is in the end determined by the interacting ligand: while dexamethasone privileges only a few poses (determined by a potential energy surface with a deep minimum), RU486 favors a wider H12 conformational amplitude, as indicated by a flatter potential landscape. By characterizing the H12 conformation in different conditions, we provide novel GR LBD models that represent potential targets for rational glucocorticoid drugs design, with the aim of accurately modulating GR activity.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32487073": " Functional compartmentalization has emerged as an important factor modulating the kinetics and specificity of biochemical reactions in the nucleus, including those involved in transcriptional regulation. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus upon hormone stimulation and distributes between the nucleoplasm and membraneless compartments named nuclear foci. While a liquid-liquid phase separation process has been recently proposed to drive the formation of many nuclear compartments, the mechanisms governing the heterogeneous organization of GR in the nucleus and the functional relevance of foci formation remain elusive. We dissected some of the molecular interactions involved in the formation of GR condensates and analyzed the GR structural determinants relevant to this process. We show that GR foci present properties consistent with those expected for biomolecular condensates formed by a liquid-liquid phase separation process in living human cells. Their formation requires an initial interaction of GR with certain chromatin regions at specific locations within the nucleus. Surprisingly, the intrinsically disordered region of GR is not essential for condensate formation, in contrast to many nuclear proteins that require disordered regions to phase separate, while the ligand-binding domain seems essential for that process. We finally show that GR condensates include Mediator, a protein complex involved in transcription regulation. We show that GR foci have properties of liquid condensates and propose that active GR molecules interact with chromatin and recruit multivalent cofactors whose interactions with additional molecules lead to the formation of a focus. The biological relevance of the interactions occurring in GR condensates supports their involvement in transcription regulation.",

This review aims to explore this bidirectional correlation by discussing the impact of metabolic syndrome on skeletal muscle tissue in general and will also discuss ways in which skeletal muscle alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Literature searches were conducted with key words (e.g. metabolic syndrome, skeletal muscle, hyperglycemia) using PubMed, EBSCOhost, Science Direct and Google Scholar. All article types were included in the search. The pathological mechanisms associated with metabolic syndrome, such as hyperglycemia and inflammation, have been associated with changes in skeletal muscle fiber composition, metabolism, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, and strength. Additionally, some skeletal muscle alterations, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance, are suggested to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. For example, the suggested underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia development are also contributors to metabolic syndrome pathogenesis.

The ability to incorporate multiple correlated traits into a joint analysis may also allow increased detection of associated genes. Therefore, to demonstrate the utility of both univariate and multivariate family-based association analysis and to identify possible genetic variants associated with metabolic syndrome, we performed a scan of the Affymetrix 50 k Human Gene Panel data using 1) each of the traits comprising metabolic syndrome: triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, and body mass index, and 2) a composite trait including all of the above, jointly.

Despite the high prevalence of obesity and its related conditions, their etiologies and pathophysiology remains unknown. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of obesity and NAFLD. Previous genetic analysis of high-fat, diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J male mice using a panel of B6-Chr(A/J)/NaJ chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) demonstrated that 17 CSSs conferred resistance to high-fat, diet-induced obesity. One of these CSS strains, CSS-17, which is homosomic for A/J-derived chromosome 17, was analyzed further and found to be resistant to diet-induced steatosis. In the current study we generated seven congenic strains derived from CCS-17, fed them either a high-fat, simple-carbohydrate (HFSC) or low-fat, simple-carbohydrate (LFSC) diet for 16 weeks and then analyzed body weight and related traits. From this study we identified several quantitative trait loci (QTLs). On a HFSC diet, Obrq13 protects against diet-induced obesity, steatosis, and elevated fasting insulin and glucose levels. On the LFSC diet, Obrq13 confers lower hepatic triglycerides, suggesting that this QTL regulates liver triglycerides regardless of diet. Obrq15 protects against diet-induced obesity and steatosis on the HFSC diet, and Obrq14 confers increased final body weight and results in steatosis and insulin resistance on the HFSC diet.

Insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia are consistently linked with a clustering of multiple clinical and subclinical metabolic risk factors. It is now widely recognised that obesity (especially abdominal fat accumulation), hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension are common metabolic traits that, concurrently, constitute the distinctive insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Cross-sectional and prospective data provide an emerging picture of associations of both physical activity habits and cardiorespiratory fitness with the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome, is a disorder that requires aggressive multi-factorial intervention. Recent treatment guidelines have emphasised the clinical utility of diagnosis and an important treatment role for 'therapeutic lifestyle change', incorporating moderate physical activity. Several previous narrative reviews have considered exercise training as an effective treatment for insulin resistance and other components of the syndrome. However, the evidence cited has been less consistent for exercise training effects on several metabolic syndrome variables, unless combined with appropriate dietary modifications to achieve weight loss. Recently published randomised controlled trial data concerning the effects of exercise training on separate metabolic syndrome traits are evaluated within this review. Novel systematic review and meta-analysis evidence is presented indicating that supervised, long-term, moderate to moderately vigorous intensity exercise training, in the absence of therapeutic weight loss, improves the dyslipidaemic profile by raising high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and lowering triglycerides in overweight and obese adults with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle interventions, including exercise and dietary-induced weight loss may improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in obesity states and are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose regulation. Randomised controlled trial evidence also indicates that exercise training decreases blood pressure in overweight/obese individuals with high normal blood pressure and hypertension. These evidence-based findings continue to support recommendations that supervised or partially supervised exercise training is an important initial adjunctive step in the treatment of individuals with the metabolic syndrome. Exercise training should be considered an essential part of 'therapeutic lifestyle change' and may concurrently improve insulin resistance and the entire cluster of metabolic risk factors.",

The (dys)metabolic syndrome is a common cluster of five pre-morbid metabolic-vascular risk factors or diseases associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity, fatty liver disease and risk of cancer. The risk for major complications such as cardiovascular diseases, NASH and some cancers develops along a continuum of risk factors into clinical diseases. Therefore we still include hyperglycemia, visceral obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension as diagnostic traits in the definition according to the term 'deadly quartet'. From the beginning elevated blood pressure and hyperglycemia were core traits of the metabolic syndrome associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus metabolic and vascular abnormalities are in extricable linked. Therefore it seems reasonable to extend the term to metabolic-vascular syndrome (MVS) to signal the clinical relevance and related risk of multimorbidity. This has important implications for integrated diagnostics and therapeutic approach. According to the definition of a syndrome the rapid global rise in the prevalence of all traits and comorbidities of the MVS is mainly caused by rapid changes in life-style and sociocultural transition resp. with over- and malnutrition, low physical activity and social stress as a common soil.",

However, there is variability in the phenotypic expression of metabolic syndrome under distinct physical activity conditions. In the present study we applied a Genotype X Environment interaction method to examine the presence of GxEE interaction in the phenotypic expression of metabolic syndrome. A total of 958 subjects, from 294 families of The Portuguese Healthy Family study, were included in the analysis. Total daily energy expenditure was assessed using a 3 day physical activity diary. Six metabolic syndrome related traits, including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, glucose, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides, were measured and adjusted for age and sex. GxEE examination was performed on SOLAR 4.3.1. All metabolic syndrome indicators were significantly heritable. The GxEE interaction model fitted the data better than the polygenic model (p&lt;0.001) for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides. For waist circumference, glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides, the significant GxEE interaction was due to rejection of the variance homogeneity hypothesis. For waist circumference and glucose, GxEE was also significant by the rejection of the genetic correlation hypothesis. The results showed that metabolic syndrome traits expression is significantly influenced by the interaction established between total daily energy expenditure and genotypes. Physical activity may be considered an environmental variable that promotes metabolic differences between individuals that are distinctively active.",

We investigated the association between the prevalence of MetS and a score of adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommendations for the prevention of cancer in a cross-sectional study of BC patients. The DIet and ANdrogen-5 study (DIANA-5) for the prevention of BC recurrences recruited 2092 early stage BC survivors aged 35-70.

Using these diaries we created a score of adherence to five relevant WCRF/AICR recommendations. The prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MetS associated with the number of recommendations met were estimated using a binomial regression model. The adjusted PRs of MetS decreased with increasing number of recommendations met (p &lt; 0.001). Meeting all the five recommendations versus meeting none or only one was significantly associated with a 57% lower MetS prevalence (95% CI 0.35-0.73).

Both IGT and IFG are associated with increased risk of developing T2DM, but recent analyses found that the thresholds of risk vary among different populations and an even lower diagnostic threshold of IFG may be appropriate. IGT has been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and some analyses have demonstrated an increased mortality risk compared with patients with normal glucose tolerance. In contrast, a continuum of increased risk of microvascular manifestations of T2DM has been demonstrated with IFG but an association of IFG with cardiovascular events has not been well established. Although both IGT and IFG are associated with resistance to insulin and increased insulin secretion, they do not identify the identical patient populations and are not equivalent in predicting development of T2DM or cardiovascular events. IFG and IGT have been associated with other features of insulin resistance, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, abdominal obesity, microalbuminuria, endothelial dysfunction, and markers of inflammation and hypercoagulability, traits collectively referred to as the metabolic syndrome. Analyses of combinations of these components have also been associated with progression to T2DM, cardiovascular disease and increased mortality. The foundation of treatment for IGT, IFG, and the metabolic syndrome is lifestyle modification, including both dietary change and routine exercise. To date, several clinical trials have found that lifestyle modification is the most efficacious strategy to prevent progression to T2DM. Alternative treatments include pharmacotherapy with metformin or acarbose, both of which have been demonstrated to decrease the development of T2DM. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating newer pharmacotherapies, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, metglitinides and thiazolidinediones, to prevent both T2DM and cardiovascular events. In combination with lifestyle modification, these therapies offer hope for effective prevention of T2DM and its consequences in high-risk patients.",

This may have prognostic implications for BC survivors. 2,092 early stage BC survivors aged 35-70, recruited in eleven Italian centres 0-5 years after surgical treatment (1.74 years on average), were followed-up over 2.8 years on average for additional BC-related events, including BC-specific mortality, distant metastasis, local recurrences and contralateral BC. At recruitment, 20 % of the patients had MS. Logistic regression models were carried out to generate OR and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for new BC events associated with MS, adjusting for baseline pathological prognostic factors. New BC events occurred in 164 patients, including 89 distant metastases. The adjusted ORs for women with MS versus women without any MS traits were 2.17 (CI 1.31-3.60) overall, and 2.45 (CI 1.24-4.82) for distant metastasis. The OR of new BC events for women with only one or two MS traits was 1.40 (CI 0.91-2.16). All MS traits were positively associated with new BC events, and significantly so for low HDL and high triglycerides. MS is an important prognostic factor in BC. As MS is reversible through lifestyle changes, interventions to decrease MS traits in BC patients should be implemented in BC clinics.",

Obesity is often associated with the clustering of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to metabolic syndrome or syndrome X. Likewise, metabolic syndrome and its associated traits are major contributing factors to the increase in nephropathy and end stage renal disease. The specific factors that link the metabolic syndrome traits to the progression of nephropathy remain largely unexplored. Recent studies have demonstrated that an imbalance between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) arachidonic acid metabolizing enzymes in the kidney may contribute to the renal damage associated with obesity. Along these lines, COX-2 inhibition decreases renal cytokine levels and glomerular injury in obese rats. Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that also contribute to chronic kidney disease in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Intriguingly, interactions between PPARs and arachidonic acid metabolites could be key determinants of renal damage in metabolic syndrome patients. Therefore, there is a promising future for pharmacological agents that manipulate COX-2 and CYP450 metabolites and PPARs to treat obesity related nephropathy.",

A number of studies have demonstrated that hundreds of non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, are involved in metabolic syndrome-related diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. However, these research results are distributed in a large number of literature, which is not conducive to analysis and use. There is an urgent need to integrate these relationship data between metabolic syndrome and non-coding RNA into a specialized database. To address this need, we developed a metabolic syndrome-associated non-coding RNA database (ncRNA2MetS) to curate the associations between metabolic syndrome and non-coding RNA. Currently, ncRNA2MetS contains 1,068 associations between five metabolic syndrome traits and 627 non-coding RNAs (543 miRNAs and 84 lncRNAs) in four species. Each record in ncRNA2MetS database represents a pair of disease-miRNA (lncRNA) association consisting of non-coding RNA category, miRNA (lncRNA) name, name of metabolic syndrome trait, expressive patterns of non-coding RNA, method for validation, specie involved, a brief introduction to the association, the article referenced, etc. We also developed a user-friendly website so that users can easily access and download all data. In short, ncRNA2MetS is a complete and high-quality data resource for exploring the role of non-coding RNA in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and seeking new treatment options.

Thirty-two SARC survivors (predominantly Ewings; median age 36.5; median age at MMT 15) underwent body composition, activity, and psychosocial analysis. Serum endocrine and inflammatory parameters and urine beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated. The prevalence of MST was compared to age- and gender-matched U.S. population data. SARC survivors were more likely to have two or more MST (OR 2.38 95% CI: [1.14, 5.04]). Analysis of individual MST demonstrated higher prevalence of hypertension (OR 2.61 95% CI: [1.20, 5.59]), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 3.63 95% CI: [1.75, 7.60]), and male visceral abdominal obesity (20-39 years old OR 4.63 95% CI: [0.91, 21.63], 40-59 years old OR infinity). Survivors 18-39 years old had a higher prevalence of the MS (OR 4.29 95% CI: [1.50, 11.21]), defined as three or more MST.

In Stage 1, approximately 317,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 2700 individuals, from which 1500 SNPs were selected to be genotyped in a further 2300 individuals. Selection for inclusion in Stage 1 was based on four metabolic syndrome component traits: HDL-cholesterol, plasma glucose and Type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity measured by waist to hip ratio, and diastolic blood pressure. Association was tested with these four traits and a composite metabolic syndrome phenotype. Four SNPs reaching significance level p&lt;5x10(-7) and with posterior probability of association &gt;0.8 were found in genes CETP and LPL, associated with HDL-cholesterol. These associations have already been reported in Indian Asians and in Europeans. Five additional loci harboured SNPs significant at p&lt;10(-6) and posterior probability &gt;0.5 for HDL-cholesterol, type 2 diabetes or diastolic blood pressure.

To describe the epidemiology of the insulin resistance syndrome, also known as the metabolic syndrome. Overall obesity, central obesity, dyslipidemia characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hyperglycemia, and hypertension are common traits that, when they occur together, constitute the metabolic syndrome. The World Health Organization and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III have proposed working definitions for the syndrome based on these traits. Cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies provide an emerging picture of the prevalence and outcomes of the syndrome. National survey data suggest the metabolic syndrome is very common, affecting about 24% of US adults who are 20 to 70 years of age and older. The syndrome is more common in older people and in Mexican Americans. People with the syndrome are about twice as likely to develop CVD and over 4 times as likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with subjects who do not have metabolic syndrome. While this syndrome may have a genetic basis, environmental factors are important modifiable risk factors for the condition. The metabolic syndrome is very common and will become even more common as populations age and become more obese. Treatment for component traits is known to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes and CVD; whether risk is reduced by treatment of the syndrome, specifically, remains uncertain. Primary care physicians must recognize that the co-occurrence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes and CVD represents an extremely adverse metabolic state warranting aggressive risk factor intervention.",

In this paper, we report a Saudi Arabian family with Liebenberg syndrome. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a 275-kb deletion within the cytogenetic band 5q31.1 which contains the H2AFY gene and 190,428bp of its downstream region. The deleted region is upstream to the PITX1 gene. The radiological features in the upper limbs of all affected members of the family were almost identical to the phenotype in the mouse model with ectopic expression of Pitx1 in the forelimbs. We therefore re-define the phenotype of Liebenberg syndrome as a transformation of the upper limbs to reflect lower limb characteristics and speculate that the area of deletion contains a regulatory sequence that suppresses the expression of PITX1 in the upper limb buds.",

Yet, the functional interpretation of these non-coding variants remains challenging. The human Liebenberg syndrome is characterised by a partial transformation of the arms into legs and has been shown to be caused by SVs at the <i>PITX1</i> locus leading to its misregulation in the forelimb by its native enhancer element Pen. This study aims to elucidate the genetic cause of an unsolved family with a mild form of Liebenberg syndrome and investigate the role of promoters in long-range gene regulation. Here, we identify SVs by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in transgenic mice to assign pathogenicity to the SVs. In this study, we used WGS in a family with three mildly affected individuals with Liebenberg syndrome and identified the smallest deletion described so far including the first non-coding exon of <i>H2AFY</i>. To functionally characterise the variant, we re-engineered the 8.5 kb deletion using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the mouse and showed that the promoter of the housekeeping gene <i>H2afy</i> insulates the Pen enhancer from <i>Pitx1</i> in forelimbs; its loss leads to misexpression of <i>Pitx1</i> by the pan-limb activity of the Pen enhancer causing Liebenberg syndrome. Our data indicate that housekeeping promoters may titrate promiscuous enhancer activity to ensure normal morphogenesis. The deletion of the <i>H2AFY</i> promoter as a cause of Liebenberg syndrome highlights this new mutational mechanism and its role in congenital disease.",

Three randomized phase III trials were identified comparing combination chemotherapy regimens containing ifosfamide with regimens without ifosfamide. Two randomized trials demonstrated that the addition of ifosfamide to either doxorubicin or to a regimen of doxorubicin and dacarbazine, significantly improved response rates. One randomized trial reported a significant improvement in overall survival for patients receiving doxorubicin and dacarbazine compared to those receiving a combination of doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and ifosfamide (MAID). A meta-analysis of these studies revealed that the addition of ifosfamide to a chemotherapy regimen significantly improves the tumour response rate (RR, 1.52, p=0.009) but does not produce a significant difference in 1-year survival (RR, 0.98, p=0.76).

Of those who received neoadjuvant treatment, 56.2% had NACRT, while 25.0% and 18.7% of patients had chemotherapy and radiotherapy respectively. Mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine (MAID) was the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment while ifosfamide (93.7%) was the most commonly used chemotherapy drug in any setting. There was no reported case of disease progression in group of patients who received NACRT apart from one patient who had oligometastatic disease at diagnosis. Median OS of the whole cohort was 38 months while median PFS was 24 months. Bone marrow toxicity was the most commonly reported high grade toxicity in NACRT group (55.5%) but there were no treatment related deaths. NACRT is not widely adopted and treatment is based on institutional preferences, however our data shows that NACRT is a feasible therapy option. NACRT should be evaluated prospectively in a randomized trial.",

There is no consensus on a chemotherapy regimen for PC, and conventional platinum-based chemotherapy has been associated with disappointing response rates and PFS. In searches for a new regimen, the sarcomatoid (spindle or giant cell) component has been assumed to be susceptible to chemotherapy used for soft tissue sarcoma. The medical records of 17 patients who received mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine (MAID) for advanced PC between January 2010 and February 2017 were retrospectively analyzed for clinicopathological features and outcomes. The median age was 59 years. Sixteen patients were male, and only one patient had never smoked. Six patients achieved partial response to MAID, leading to an objective response rate of 35%. The median PFS was 2.8 months, and the median OS was 8.7 months. Hematologic toxicity-related adverse events were the most frequent, which comprised grade 3-4 anemia in 35% of patients, neutropenia in 47%, thrombocytopenia in 24%, and febrile neutropenia in 29%. No febrile neutropenia was reported in patients who received 5-day granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis. Most adverse events resolved without complications, except for one death due to sepsis. MAID is an effective, and possibly important, regimen for PC. MAID could be more safely used in clinical practice with appropriate dose modifications and G-CSF primary prophylaxis according to patients' status.",

A regimen of pre-operative chemotherapy consisting of mesna, adriamycin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine (MAID), interdigitated with radiotherapy (RT), followed by resection and post-operative chemotherapy with or without RT, has demonstrated high rates of local and distant control. The goal of this study is to assess outcomes in a recent cohort of patients treated on this regimen. We retrospectively reviewed records of 66 consecutive patients with STS of the extremity or trunk who were treated with the aforementioned regimen from May 2000 to April 2011. Clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcomes were analysed. Sixty-six patients were analysed and were equally divided between grade 2 and 3 tumours. Margins were negative in 57 (89%) patients and positive in seven (11%) patients. At a median follow-up of 46 months, there were six (9%) locoregional and 20 (30%) distant recurrences. The locoregional and distant 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 91% and 64%, respectively. The 5-year overall (OS) and disease-specific survival rates were 86% and 89%, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths or secondary myelodysplasias. Thirty-four (52%) patients had grade 3 or 4 acute haematologic chemotherapy-related toxicity. There were no statistically significant predictors of OS or RFS. For a contemporary cohort of patients with high-risk extremity and truncal STS, a regimen of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery continues to result in high rates of survival with tolerable short- and long-term toxicity.",

However, the role of chemotherapy remains controversial. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy, feasibility and adverse effects of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with modified mesna, adriamycin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine (MAID) regimen for NSRCSTSs. We conducted a retrospective review of 40 consecutive patients (29 men, 11 women; median age 47 years) with high-grade NSRCSTSs treated in two referral centers between 2004 and 2009 (median follow-up 38.5 months). Patients with distant or nodal metastases at diagnosis were excluded. The regimen consisted of ifosfamide 2,500 mg/m(2)/6 h (days 1-3), mesna 2,500 mg/m(2)/6 h (days 1-3), tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin 20 mg/m(2)/0.5 h (days 1-3), and dacarbazine 300 mg/m(2)/1 h (days 1-3). Among the 26 evaluable patients, there were 8 with a partial response, 15 with stable disease, and 3 with progressive disease. Two- and 5-year overall survival rates were 92 and 86%, respectively, and corresponding disease-free survival rates were 80 and 77%. All relapses were metastases without local recurrence. Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 38, 18, and 21 patients, respectively. No serious infectious complications occurred due to the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and prophylactic antibiotics. No other life-threatening serious adverse events were observed. The modified MAID regimen achieved a better outcome with less serious adverse events than previously reported and is a potential option in the management of NSRCSTSs. Further evaluation with long-term follow-up is required.",

The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of MAID regimen (mesna/ifosfamide + Adriamycin + dacarbazine) in the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Twenty-two patients with advanced STS were treated by MAID(Adriamycin 60 mg/m2, ifosfamide 6,000 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 1,000 mg/m2). These drugs were administered as continuous intravenous infusion for 72 hours while mesna was infused continuously for 96 hours. Partial response rate was 36.4% without complete remission. The duration of response ranged from 2-10 months with median of 4.6 months. Main toxicities were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia. Percentage of leucopenia, nausea/vomiting, and alopecia in WHO grade III and IV were 63.6%, 27.3%, and 50%, respectively.

Adjuvant chemotherapy is used routinely based on data from randomized trials. Although a percentage of children with locally advanced or metastatic tumors remain curable, few data exist regarding the tumor's natural history or response and survival in adults. This Phase II study evaluated doxorubicin, dacarbazine, ifosfamide, and mesna (MAID) in adults with inoperable or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or osteosarcoma. Between 1987-1991, 81 patients were entered; 69 patients were eligible. One patient died of neutropenic infection. Ten patients (14%) responded completely and 34 patients (49%) had a complete or partial response. Response rates were significantly higher for patients with Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma than for those with osteosarcoma (77%, 64%, and 26%, respectively; P &lt; 0.005). Although there were no significant differences in progression free survival by histology, survival for patients with Ewing's sarcoma was significantly longer than for patients with osteosarcoma (P = 0.004.) At the time of last follow-up, 7 patients (10%) were alive without progression: 3 with Ewing's sarcoma, 1 with osteosarcoma, and 3 with rhabdomyosarcoma. MAID chemotherapy is an active regimen in adults with advanced or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Although there was no direct comparison with a doxorubicin and cisplatin-based regimen, the response rate and survival in patients with osteosarcoma suggest that doxorubicin and cisplatin-based chemotherapy would remain the accepted initial chemotherapy regimen. For patients with rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma, 10-20% of patients remained disease free at 5 years.",

The results of treatment with MAID were disappointing. Overall, the response rate was 9% with one complete response and one partial response (both in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma). We did not observe any responses among the patients with carcinosarcomas of either ovarian or uterine origin. The median progression-free interval and survival were 11 months and 29 months, respectively. This regimen was associated with substantial toxicity (including a death from neutropenic sepsis) as well as high cost and inconvenience due to the requirement for inpatient administration.

Forty-eight patients with metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma were, following the first cycle of a combination with doxorubicin 60 mg/m2, ifosfamide 7.5 g/m2, and dacarbazine 900 mg/m2, ifosfamide 7.5 g/m2, and dacarbazine 900 mg/m2 given on days 1 to 3, randomized to receive either lenograstim 5 micrograms/kg/d by once-daily injection from day 4 to day 13, or its vehicle. For subsequent cycles, 28 patients continued on the same chemotherapy and lenograstim was systematically given as prophylactic treatment in an open manner. Following the first cycle of MAID, the duration of neutropenia was reduced in patients who received lenograstim as compared with those who received placebo, with a median duration of neutropenia ( &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils) of 0 days (range, 0 to 3) and 5 days (range, 0 to 10), respectively (P &lt; .001). All patients who received lenograstim had recovered at least 1 x 10(9)/L neutrophils (polymorphonuclear lymphocytes [PMN]) on day 14, compared with only one of 26 in the placebo group (P &lt; .001). The median time to recover this neutrophil level was 12 days (range, 10 to 13) and 17 days (range, 14 to 21), respectively (P &lt; .001). Neutropenic fever occurred in five (23%) and 15 (58%) patients respectively (P = .02). Twenty-eight patients received at least two cycles (median, four) of MAID at the same dose.

A progressive increase in thrombocytopenia was noted, with median platelet nadirs of 102 x 10(9)/L at cycle 2 and 19.5 x 10(9)/L at cycle 6, but did not result in significant treatment modifications. Consequently, median relative dose-intensities remained greater than 0.95 for up to six consecutive MAID cycles. Lenograstim significantly improved hematologic tolerance in patients treated with the MAID chemotherapy regimen and, therefore, allowed optimal adhesion to the theoretic doses planned for up to six cycles. Whether such an optimization in relative dose-intensity will result in an improvement of treatment efficacy remains to be determined.",

Myelosuppression was dose limiting, causing the only toxic death (sepsis). Nonhematologic toxicity consisted predominantly of anorexia and vomiting. Severe mucositis, macroscopic hematuria, renal tubular acidosis, renal failure, and CNS toxicity occurred in less than 5% of cycles. No cardiotoxicity was detected. The overall response rate (10% complete response [CR]) was 47% (95% confidence intervals, 5% to 18% and 37% to 57%, respectively). Most responses (approximately 70%) were observed within two cycles. Median times to progression were 10 and 9 months, respectively. Histologic high tumor grade, lesions less than 5 cm, and less than 1 year from diagnosis to study entry correlated with the probability of response. The median survival was 16 months. Time from diagnosis to study entry, performance status, and extent of disease, but not histologic grade, correlated with survival. Following CR, two patients remain disease-free at 32 and 16 months. Of the 15 additional patients rendered disease-free with surgery, two remain disease-free at 30 and 18 months with no further therapy. While most relapses occurred in sites of prior involvement, death from CNS metastases occurred in 11 of the 80 patients with high-grade sarcomas, of whom seven were still responding systematically (three complete responders).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31995340": "Glucocorticoids (GC) such as cortisol regulate multiple physiological functions, notably those involved in development, metabolism, inflammatory processes and stress, and exert their effects upon binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, encoded by NR3C1 gene in humans). GC signaling follows several consecutive steps leading to target gene transactivation, including ligand binding, nuclear translocation of ligand-activated GR complexes, DNA binding, and recruitment of functional transcriptional machinery. Generalized glucocorticoid resistance syndrome, due to GR loss-of-function mutations, may be related to the impairment of one of the GC signaling steps. To date, 31 NR3C1 loss-of-function mutations have been reported in patients presenting with various clinical signs such as hypertension, adrenal hyperplasia, hirsutism or metabolic disorders associated with biological hypercortisolism but without Cushing syndrome signs and no negative regulatory feedback loop on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Functional characterization of GR loss-of-function mutations often demonstrates GR haploinsufficiency and a decrease of GR target gene induction in relevant cell types. The main signs at presentation are very variable from resistant hypertension, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia likely related to increased ACTH levels but not exclusively, hirsutism to isolated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system abnormalities in a context of 11\u03b2HSD2 deficiency. Some mutated GR patients are obese or overweight together with a healthier metabolic profile that remains to be further explored in future studies. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms altered by GR mutations should enhance our knowledge on GR signaling and ultimately facilitate management of GC-resistant patients. This review also focuses on the criteria facilitating identification of novel NR3C1 mutations in selected patients.",

Upon ligand binding, activated GR mediates cellular effects by regulating gene expression, but some GR effects can occur rapidly without new transcription. Here, we show that GCs rapidly inhibit cell migration, in response to both GR agonist and antagonist ligand binding. The inhibitory effect on migration is prevented by GR knockdown with siRNA, confirming GR specificity, but not by actinomycin D treatment, suggesting a non-transcriptional mechanism. We identified a rapid onset increase in microtubule polymerisation following GC treatment, identifying cytoskeletal stabilisation as the likely mechanism of action. HDAC6 overexpression, but not knockdown of \u03b1TAT1, rescued the GC effect, implicating HDAC6 as the GR effector. Consistent with this hypothesis, ligand-dependent cytoplasmic interaction between GR and HDAC6 was demonstrated by quantitative imaging. Taken together, we propose that activated GR inhibits HDAC6 function, and thereby increases the stability of the microtubule network to reduce cell motility. We therefore report a novel, non-transcriptional mechanism whereby GCs impair cell motility through inhibition of HDAC6 and rapid reorganization of the cell architecture.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528419": "A decline in normal physiological functions characterizes the aging process. While some of these changes are benign, the decrease in the function of the cardiovascular system that occurs during aging leads to the activation of pathological processes associated with an increased risk for heart disease and its complications. Imbalances in endocrine function are also common occurrences during the aging process. Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones and are critical regulators of energy metabolism, inflammation, and cardiac function. Glucocorticoids exert their actions by binding the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, in some instances, to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). GR and MR are members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. There is strong evidence that imbalances in GR and MR signaling in the heart have a causal role in cardiac disease. The extent to which glucocorticoids play a role in the aging heart, however, remains unclear. This review will summarize the positive and negative direct and indirect effects of glucocorticoids on the heart and the latest molecular and physiological evidence on how alterations in glucocorticoid signaling lead to changes in cardiac structure and function. We also briefly discuss the effects of other hormones systems such as estrogens and GH/IGF-1 on different cardiovascular cells during aging. We will also review the link between imbalances in glucocorticoid levels and the molecular processes responsible for promoting cardiomyocyte dysfunction in aging.

The index case was an Italian 31-year-old woman with a history of chronic fatigue, anxiety, hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, and infertility, but no clinical manifestations suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. Standard clinical methods were used to assess the patient's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Molecular analysis of the NR3C1 gene was performed by Sanger sequencing. In addition, we perform an extensive survey of all clinical pathogenic variants modifying the whole sequence of the NR3C1 gene. Endocrinologic evaluation revealed elevated serum cortisol, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, and androstenedione concentration and increased urinary free cortisol excretion. Morning serum cortisol levels remained elevated and were not suppressed during a 2-day, 2-mg dexamethasone suppression test. The identification of the novel p.(Glu123Ter) NR3C1 variant confirmed the diagnosis of glucocorticoid resistance. Our findings improve the understanding of NR3C1 mutational spectrum in patients affected by glucocorticoid resistance syndrome and contribute to precise diagnosis and genetic counseling.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078801": "Super-enhancers comprise of clusters of enhancers that are typically defined by the ChIP-seq analysis for active histone marks. Although the biological significance of super-enhancers is still controversial, this concept is gaining prominence as useful characteristics of genes that play crucial roles in normal development and pathogenesis of cancer. In various cancer cells, super-enhancers are often associated with genes involved in carcinogenesis. For example, in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1 and MYB) are regulated by super-enhancers; these genes are sensitive to transcriptional inhibition, for example, via the pharmacological approach using a small-molecule CDK7 inhibitor. This preferential inhibition of cancer genes can also be observed for other types of cancer. Based on these findings, we recently performed super-enhancer profiling combined with gene expression analysis in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which is a genetically complicated hematological malignancy, to identify critical genes responsible for the pathogenesis. This review article aims to discuss the concept of super-enhancers, their significance in biomedical research, and their potential utility in elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of cancer.",

In a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, we found that heterozygous somatic mutations are acquired that introduce binding motifs for the MYB transcription factor in a precise noncoding site, which creates a super-enhancer upstream of the TAL1 oncogene. MYB binds to this new site and recruits its H3K27 acetylase-binding partner CBP, as well as core components of a major leukemogenic transcriptional complex that contains RUNX1, GATA-3, and TAL1 itself. Additionally, most endogenous super-enhancers found in T-ALL cells are occupied by MYB and CBP, which suggests a general role for MYB in super-enhancer initiation. Thus, this study identifies a genetic mechanism responsible for the generation of oncogenic super-enhancers in malignant cells.",

Recent advances in pancreatic cancer research uncovered various molecular subtypes with tumors expressing a squamous/basal-like gene expression signature displaying a worse prognosis. Through unbiased epigenome mapping, we identified deltaNp63 as a major driver of a gene signature in pancreatic cancer cell lines, which we report to faithfully represent the highly aggressive pancreatic squamous subtype observed in vivo, and display the specific epigenetic marking of genes associated with decreased survival. Importantly, depletion of deltaNp63 in these systems significantly decreased cell proliferation and gene expression patterns associated with a squamous subtype and transcriptionally mimicked a subtype switch. Using genomic localization data of deltaNp63 in pancreatic cancer cell lines coupled with epigenome mapping data from patient-derived xenografts, we uncovered that deltaNp63 mainly exerts its effects by activating subtype-specific super enhancers. Furthermore, we identified a group of 45 subtype-specific super enhancers that are associated with poorer prognosis and are highly dependent on deltaNp63. Genes associated with these enhancers included a network of transcription factors, including HIF1A, BHLHE40, and RXRA, which form a highly intertwined transcriptional regulatory network with deltaNp63 to further activate downstream genes associated with poor survival.",

Recent studies suggest that key genes regulating cell type-specific functions reside in enhancer-dense genomic regions (i.e., super enhancers, stretch enhancers). Here we report that enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) identified by global nuclear run-on sequencing are extensively transcribed within super enhancers and are dynamically regulated in response to cellular signaling. Using Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in macrophages as a model system, we find that transcription of super enhancer-associated eRNAs is dynamically induced at most of the key genes driving innate immunity and inflammation. Unexpectedly, genes repressed by TLR4 signaling are also associated with super enhancer domains and accompanied by massive repression of eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we find each super enhancer acts as a single regulatory unit within which eRNA and genic transcripts are coordinately regulated. The key regulatory activity of these domains is further supported by the finding that super enhancer-associated transcription factor binding is twice as likely to be conserved between human and mouse than typical enhancer sites. Our study suggests that transcriptional activities at super enhancers are critical components to understand the dynamic gene regulatory network.",

The oncogenically activated pancreatic epithelium and its associated stroma are obligatorily interdependent, with the resulting inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment contributing greatly to the evolution and maintenance of PDAC. The peculiar pancreas-specific tumor phenotype is a consequence of oncogenes hacking the resident pancreas regenerative program, a tissue-specific repair mechanism regulated by discrete super enhancer networks. Defined as genomic regions containing clusters of multiple enhancers, super enhancers play pivotal roles in cell/tissue specification, identity, and maintenance. Hence, interfering with such super enhancer-driven repair networks should exert a disproportionately disruptive effect on tumor versus normal pancreatic tissue. Novel drugs that directly or indirectly inhibit processes regulating epigenetic status and integrity, including those driven by histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferase and hydroxylases, DNA methyltransferases, various metabolic enzymes, and bromodomain and extraterminal motif proteins, have shown the feasibility of disrupting super enhancer-dependent transcription in treating multiple tumor types, including PDAC.

A super-enhancer region highly occupied by the BET family member BRD4 was identified for the PGC-1\u03b1 gene. BET inhibitor treatment prevented this interaction, leading to a dramatic reduction of PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Accordingly, BET inhibition diminished respiration and mitochondrial function in cells. In vivo, melanoma models with high PGC-1\u03b1 expression strongly responded to BET inhibition by reduction of PGC-1\u03b1 and impaired tumor growth.

Broad trimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) often defines active tumor suppressor genes. However, how these epigenomic signatures are regulated for tumor suppression is little understood. Here we show that brain-specific knockout of the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL4 (a COMPASS-like enzyme, also known as KMT2D) in mice spontaneously induces medulloblastoma. Mll4 loss upregulates oncogenic Ras and Notch pathways while downregulating neuronal gene expression programs. MLL4 enhances DNMT3A-catalyzed DNA methylation and SIRT1/BCL6-mediated H4K16 deacetylation, which antagonize expression of Ras activators and Notch pathway components, respectively. Notably, Mll4 loss downregulates tumor suppressor genes (e.g., Dnmt3a and Bcl6) by diminishing broad H3K4me3 and super-enhancers and also causes widespread impairment of these epigenomic signatures during medulloblastoma genesis.

We addressed these issues by developing an unsupervised machine learning approach termed clustering of genomic regions analysis method (CREAM). CREAM automates CORE detection from chromatin accessibility profiles that are enriched in CREs strongly bound by master transcription regulators, proximal to highly expressed and essential genes, and discriminating cell identity. Although COREs share similarities with super-enhancers, we highlight differences in terms of the genomic distribution and structure of these <i>cis</i>-regulatory units. We further show the enhanced value of COREs over super-enhancers to identify master transcription regulators, highly expressed and essential genes defining cell identity. COREs enrich at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries. They are also preferentially bound by the chromatin looping factors CTCF and cohesin, in contrast to super-enhancers, forming clusters of CTCF and cohesin binding regions and defining homotypic clusters of transcription regulator binding regions (HCTs).

Several studies have characterized these regulatory regions in numerous cell types and tissues to decipher their functional importance. However, the differences and similarities between these regulatory regions have not been fully assessed. We integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from ten human cell types to perform a comparative analysis of super and stretch enhancers with respect to their chromatin profiles, cell type-specificity, and ability to control gene expression. We found that stretch enhancers are more abundant, more distal to transcription start sites, cover twice as much the genome, and are significantly less conserved than super-enhancers. In contrast, super-enhancers are significantly more enriched for active chromatin marks and cohesin complex, and more transcriptionally active than stretch enhancers. Importantly, a vast majority of super-enhancers (85%) overlap with only a small subset of stretch enhancers (13%), which are enriched for cell type-specific biological functions, and control cell identity genes. These results suggest that super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell type-specific than stretch enhancers, and importantly, most of the stretch enhancers that are distinct from super-enhancers do not show an association with cell identity genes, are less active, and more likely to be poised enhancers.",

It is therefore plausible that with an increasing number of drugs the risk of drug interactions increases. Such interactions can be either pharmacodynamic (and are due to the mechanism of the administered drugs) or they can be pharmacokinetic (resulting in a reduction or enhancement of drug elimination). Pharmacokinetic interactions can be either due to interactions at the level of drug metabolizing enzymes (most important cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes) or interactions at the level of drug transporter proteins (for example P-glycoprotein (MDR1)). It is important to distinguish between both mechanisms because interactions at transporter proteins can be attributed to those drugs that are not enzymatically metabolized. The scope of this article is to give an overview on clinically relevant interactions of the four beta-blockers widely used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases namely atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7), bisoprolol (CAS 66722-44-9), metoprolol (CAS 37350-58-6) (each beta-1 selective), and carvedilol (CAS 72956-09-3) (beta-1 and beta-2 nonselective). Among these beta-blockers atenolol is mainly eliminated by renal excretion, bisoprolol is in part excreted as parent compound via the renal route (50%), the other 50% are hepatically metabolised, whereas metoprolol and carvedilol are metabolised by CYP2D6. In addition, evidence is accumulating that carvedilol is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. For these four beta-blockers various pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions have been demonstrated. Such interactions that result in an altered pharmacokinetics are mainly observed with those beta-blockers that are excreted via metabolism (metoprolol and carvedilol). Accordingly these drugs have a higher potential for drug interactions. However, it should be emphasized that, in general, beta-blockers are well tolerated safe drugs with a large therapeutic index.",

The incidence of medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 70.1% lower (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.3 to 81.2) with nirsevimab prophylaxis than with placebo (2.6% [25 infants] vs. 9.5% [46 infants]; P&lt;0.001) and the incidence of hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 78.4% lower (95% CI, 51.9 to 90.3) with nirsevimab than with placebo (0.8% [8 infants] vs. 4.1% [20 infants]; P&lt;0.001). These differences were consistent throughout the 150-day period after the dose was administered and across geographic locations and RSV subtypes. Adverse events were similar in the two trial groups, with no notable hypersensitivity reactions. A single injection of nirsevimab resulted in fewer medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations than placebo throughout the RSV season in healthy preterm infants.

There is no approved treatment for HMPV and only one prophylactic treatment against RSV, palivizumab, for high-risk infants. Better understanding of the viral lifecycles in a more relevant model system may help identify novel therapeutic targets. By utilizing three-dimensional (3-D) human airway tissues to examine viral infection in a physiologically relevant model system, we showed that RSV infects and spreads more efficiently than HMPV, with the latter requiring higher multiplicities of infection (MOIs) to yield similar levels of infection. Apical ciliated cells were the target for both viruses, but RSV apical release was significantly more efficient than HMPV. In RSV- or HMPV-infected cells, cytosolic inclusion bodies containing the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and respective viral genomic RNA were clearly observed in human airway epithelial (HAE) culture. In HMPV-infected cells, actin-based filamentous extensions were more common (35.8%) than those found in RSV-infected cells (4.4%). Interestingly, neither RSV nor HMPV formed syncytia in HAE tissues. Palivizumab and nirsevimab effectively inhibited entry and spread of RSV in HAE tissues, with nirsevimab displaying significantly higher potency than palivizumab. In contrast, 54G10 completely inhibited HMPV entry but only modestly reduced viral spread, suggesting HMPV may use alternative mechanisms for spread. These results represent the first comparative analysis of infection by the two pneumoviruses in a physiologically relevant model, demonstrating an interesting dichotomy in the mechanisms of infection, spread, and consequent inhibition of the viral lifecycles by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus are leading causes of respiratory illness worldwide, but limited treatment options are available. To better target these viruses, we examined key aspects of the viral life cycle in three-dimensional (3-D) human airway tissues. Both viruses establish efficient infection through the apical surface, but efficient spread and apical release were seen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but not human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Both viruses form inclusion bodies, minimally composed of nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and viral RNA (vRNA), indicating that these structures are critical for replication in this more physiological model. HMPV formed significantly more long, filamentous actin-based extensions in human airway epithelial (HAE) tissues than RSV, suggesting HMPV may promote cell-to-cell spread via these extensions. Lastly, RSV entry and spread were fully inhibited by neutralizing antibodies palivizumab and the novel nirsevimab. In contrast, while HMPV entry was fully inhibited by 54G10, a neutralizing antibody, spread was only modestly reduced, further supporting a cell-to-cell spread mechanism.",

However, the role of TSK in cancer remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological significance of TSK in lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry of lung cancer tissues and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of lung cancer cell lines were carried out to detect TSK. Then, RNA sequence analysis, Gene Ontology analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, cell counting assay, invasion assays, and xenograft studies were done in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, H1975 with modification of TSK expression levels, in order to investigate its biological roles, in particular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proliferation. TSK was found to be highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. Modification of TSK expression levels in H1975 resulted in changes in molecules related to EMT, including cadherin-1, snail family transcriptional repressor 1, snail family transcriptional repressor 2, and vimentin. The results of cell counting and xenograft assays showed that TSK promotes cell proliferation. In lung cancer cells, TSK is expressed more highly than the other SLRPs family members, and regulates the EMT and proliferation. Thus, TSK may be a key coordinator of multiple pathways and an important structural element in the lung cancer microenvironment.",

Using microarray analysis, we identified novel SXR target genes that were activated by vitamin K2 in osteoblastic cells. Among them, a small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan, tsukushi, has been shown to contribute to collagen accumulation, and the protein may interact with another vitamin K2-inducible SXR target, matrilin-2, a member of the matrilin family that functions as collagen adaptors.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11849819": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, that includes also gamma-amino-butiric-acid(A), glycine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) receptors. Functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors result from the association of five subunits each contributing to the pore lining. The major neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are heterologous pentamers of alpha4beta2 subunits (brain), or alpha3beta4 subunits (autonomic ganglia). Another class of neuronal receptors that are found both in the central and peripheral nervous system is the homomeric alpha7 receptor. The muscle receptor subtypes comprise of alphabetadeltagamma (embryonal) or alphabetadeltaepsilon (adult) subunits. Although nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are not directly involved in the hypnotic component of anesthesia, it is possible that modulation of central nicotinic transmission by volatile agents contributes to analgesia. The main effect of anesthetic agents on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is inhibitory. Volatile anesthetics and ketamine are the most potent inhibitors both at alpha4beta2 and alpha3beta4 receptors with clinically relevant IC(50) values. Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are more sensitive to anesthetics than their muscle counterparts, with the exception of the alpha7 receptor. Several intravenous anesthetics such as barbiturates, etomidate, and propofol exert also an inhibitory effect on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, but only at concentrations higher than those necessary for anesthesia. Usual clinical concentrations of curare cause competitive inhibition of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors while higher concentrations may induce open channel blockade. Neuronal nAChRs like alpha4beta2 and alpha3beta4 are inhibited by atracurium, a curare derivative, but at low concentrations the alpha4beta2 receptor is activated. Inhibition of sympathetic transmission by clinically relevant concentrations of some anesthetic agents is probably one of the factors involved in arterial hypotension during anesthesia.",

Chronic treatment of embryos during this period with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-blocking agents [e.g., curare or alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX)] prevents the death of MNs. Although this rescue effect has been attributed previously to a peripheral site of action of the nAChR-blocking agents at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), because nAChRs are expressed in both muscle and spinal cord, it has been suggested that the rescue effect may, in fact, be mediated by a direct central action of nAChR antagonists. By using a variety of different nAChR-blocking agents that target specific muscle or neuronal nAChR subunits, we find that only those agents that act on muscle-type receptors block neuromuscular activity and rescue MNs. However, paralytic, muscular dysgenic mutant chick embryos also exhibit significant increases in MN survival that can be further enhanced by treatment with curare or alpha-BTX, suggesting that muscle paralysis may not be the sole factor involved in MN survival. Taken together, the data presented here support the argument that, in vivo, nAChR antagonists promote the survival of spinal MNs primarily by acting peripherally at the NMJ to inhibit synaptic transmission and reduce or block muscle activity. Although a central action of these agents involving direct perturbations of MN activity may also play a contributory role, further studies are needed to determine more precisely the relative roles of central versus peripheral sites of action in MN rescue.",

The short neurotoxins to which erabutoxins belong act by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the post synaptic membrane in a manner similar to that of curare. X-ray crystallography and NMR analyses showed that the toxins have a three-finger structure, in which three fingers made of three loops emerging from a dense core make a gently concave surface of the protein. The sequence comparison and the location of essential residues on the protein suggested the mechanism of binding of the toxin to the acetylcholine receptor.

Anatomically, the eel UES muscle consists of striated fibers. The EFS-induced contraction of the UES was completely blocked by tetrodotoxin and curare, and abolished in Ca2+ -free Ringer solution. These results suggest that the EFS stimulates nerve fibers specifically and releases acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. In fact, acetylcholine and carbachol constricted the UES in a concentration-dependent manner. Even after blocking neuronal firing with tetrodotoxin, acetylcholine constricted the UES muscle, suggesting the existence of acetylcholine receptors on the UES muscle cells. Both EFS- and carbachol-evoked contractions of the UES were blocked by curare at a lower concentration than by atropine or hexamethonium, suggesting that the acetylcholine receptor is nicotinic. Even in Ca2+ -free Ringer solution, a direct current stimulus (2 s duration) constricted the UES muscle to an extent similar to that in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that the muscle contraction itself does not need extracellular Ca2+, i.e., the muscle can be constricted by a release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.",

We used the brainstem-spinal cord preparation in the split-bath configuration, and applied drugs to the brainstem compartment while measuring the burst frequency and amplitude of the fourth cervical ventral nerve roots (C4VR), which contain the axons of phrenic motoneurons. We applied ACh alone; the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist curare, either alone or in the presence of ACh; and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist atropine, either alone or in the presence of ACh. The main findings include: (1) atropine reduced frequency similarly in controls and DNE animals, while curare caused modest slowing in controls but no consistent change in DNE animals; (2) DNE greatly attenuated the increase in C4VR frequency mediated by exogenous ACh; (3) stimulation of nAChRs with ACh in the presence of atropine increased frequency markedly in controls, but not DNE animals; (4) stimulation of mAChRs with ACh in the presence of curare caused a modest increase in frequency, with no treatment group differences.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2479422": "The curare-induced subconductance state of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of mouse skeletal muscle was examined using the patch-clamp technique. Two mechanisms for the generation of subconductance states were considered. One of these mechanisms entails allosteric induction of a distinct channel conformation through the binding of curare to the agonist binding site. The other mechanism entails the binding of curare to a different site on the protein. Occupation of this site would then limit the flow of ions through the channel. The voltage dependence and concentration dependence of subconductance state kinetics are consistent with curare binding to a site within the channel. The first order rate constant for binding is 1.2 X 10(6) M-1s-1 at 0 mV, and increases e-fold per 118 mV of membrane hyperpolarization. The rate of curare dissociation from this site is 1.9 X 10(2)s-1 at 0 mV, and decreases e-fold per 95 mV hyperpolarization. The equilibrium constant is 1.4 X 10(-4) M at 0 mV, and decreases e-fold per 55 mV hyperpolarization. This voltage dependence suggests that the fraction of the transmembrane potential traversed by curare in binding to this site is 0.46 or 0.23, depending on whether one assumes that one or both charges of curare sense the electric field. Successive reduction and alkylation of the AChR agonist binding sites with dithiothreitol (DTT) and N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), a treatment which results in the loss of responsiveness of the AChR to agonists, produced no change in curare-induced subconductance events, despite the fact that after this treatment most of the channel openings occurred spontaneously. Mixtures of high concentrations of carbamylcholine (CCh) with a low concentration of curare, which produce channel openings gated predominantly by CCH, resulted in subconductance state kinetics similar to those seen in curare alone at the same concentration. Thus displacement by CCh of curare from the agonist binding sites does not prevent curare from inducing subconductances. The results presented here support the hypothesis that curare induces subconductance states by binding to a site on the receptor other than the agonist binding sites, possibly within the channel pore. It is the occupation of this site by curare that limits the flow of ions through an otherwise fully opened channel.",

Several conserved tyrosine residues in the large extracellular amino terminus of the alpha subunit of the receptor have been implicated by both chemical labeling and mutagenesis studies as playing an important role in the interaction of acetylcholine with the receptor. We and others have previously shown that substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at position 198 of the alpha subunit (alpha Y198F) leads to a rightward shift in the dose-response curve for acetylcholine-elicited currents. We have further investigated this particular mutation by examining the interaction of the competitive antagonist d-tubocurarine (curare) with the receptor. In contrast to the effect on the interaction of agonists with the receptor, this mutation leads to a marked increase in the affinity of the receptor for curare. Furthermore, this enhancement in affinity is selective for curare and is not seen with other competitive antagonists (pancuronium, beta-erythroidine, and gallamine). Examination of the structures of these competitive antagonists leads to the proposal that this enhancement is due to the formation of an aromatic-aromatic interaction between the phenylalanine ring at position alpha 198 in the mutant and one of the aromatic rings of curare and that this can provide information about the spatial arrangement of this residue in the binding site.",

We have examined the role of several highly conserved residues of the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subunits in the interaction of curare with the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Curare inhibition of wild-type receptors is consistent with curare binding to a single high-affinity binding site [inhibitor constant (Ki) = 20 nM]. Phenylalanine substitutions for two tyrosine residues implicated as being in the ligand binding site (alpha Y93F, alpha Y190F) reduce curare affinity, indicating that these residues are also important for high-affinity curare binding. Phenylalanine substitution for alpha Y198 [alpha Y198F (notation used here: subunit/amino acid in wild-type/residue number/substitution)] causes a 10-fold increase in curare affinity (Ki = 3.1 nM), and measurement of the recovery from curare inhibition indicates that this increase in affinity is due to a reduction in the rate of curare dissociation from the receptor. In addition to the alpha-subunits, portions of the ligand binding sites also reside on the gamma- and delta-subunits, and photoaffinity studies have implicated two residues (gamma W55 and delta W57) as forming part of the curare sites. The gamma W55L mutation results in an eightfold decrease in curare affinity (Ki = 170 nM), whereas the delta W57L mutation has no effect.

Here we describe the weak agonist action of 10(-5) M curare on the murine skeletal muscle cell line, G8. Although curare induces no depolarization in G8 cells, single-channel recordings reveal short-lived curare-induced currents. A feature of these brief events is the multiplicity of conductance levels (of the four levels with conductances of 48, 37, 14, and 6 pS, none had a lifetime greater than 1.5 ms). Most well-resolved events (about 17% of which are to a subconductance) last less than 0.5 ms, with activation occurring predominantly as isolated events rather than in bursts. Agonism is not, however, a high probability action for curare: calculations based on the frequency of events at half-saturating conditions suggest that curare-induced channel openings occur during less than 1% of acetylcholine receptor-curare binding episodes. The outcome is (a) an agonist action too feeble to perturb the membrane voltage and (b) a powerful competitive antagonist action.",

In adult rat muscle, the partial agonist activity of curare can also be demonstrated, though it is much weaker than in embryonic muscle.

The effect of bungarotoxin is partially reversible. These electrophysiological results, together with the effects of perhydrohistrionicotoxin and/or d-tubocurarine on the binding of [(3)H]monoacetyl-alpha-bungarotoxin at endplates of murine diaphragm muscle and on the bungarotoxin-elicited irreversible blockade of neuromuscular transmission, suggest that at least two types of sites participate in the synaptic excitation by acetylcholine. One site, competitively blocked by bungarotoxin and by curare, is presumably the acetylcholine receptor. Binding of bungarotoxin at this site is responsible for an irreversible blockade of neuromuscular transmission. The second site, competitively blocked by bungarotoxin and perhydrohistrionicotoxin, is proposed to be part of the cholinergic ion conductance modulator.

Each of these substances may on different specific neurons elicit at least three types of response, caused by a fast depolarizing Na+, a fast hyperpolarizing Cl-, or a slow hyperpolarizing K+ conductance increase. All responses resulting from either Na+ or Cl- conductance increases, irrespective of which putative transmitter activated the response, were sensitive to curare. Most were totally blocked by less than or equal to 10-4 M curare. GABA responses were less sensitive and were often only depressed by 10-3 M curare. K+ conductance responses, irrespective of the transmitter, were not curare sensitive. These results are consistent with a model of receptor organization in which one neurotransmitter receptor may be associated with any of at least three ionophores, mediating conductance increase responses to Na+, Cl-, and K+, respectively.

We aimed to assess BEL's effects on these severe, potentially life-threatening manifestations. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective observational cohort study using routine clinical data in a case series of patients with SLE receiving BEL. <b>Results:</b> Sixteen patients received BEL therapy for active SLE. Nine were excluded because they had no LN or NPSLE. Six suffered from LN, and one patient had NPSLE. All LN patients received BEL in addition to standard therapy including glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, and mycophenolate mofetil in five cases, and tacrolimus in one case. Three patients with proteinuria &gt;1,000 mg/g creatinine responded well (one complete, two partial renal responses); all other patients had decreasing proteinuria and a reduction in anti-dsDNA levels. The patient with NPSLE who had failed previous therapies had persistent clinical improvement of cutaneous and neuropsychiatric manifestations. There was one mild allergic reaction and one lower respiratory tract infection, but no other adverse events. One patient discontinued therapy due to a lack of improvement in clinical symptoms, another because of clinical remission. <b>Conclusions:</b> In our series, BEL led to a decrease of proteinuria in patients with proteinuria of more than 1,000 mg/g creatinine despite standard of care treatment, and led to a marked clinical improvement in one patient with NPSLE. No adverse events were observed. Routinely administered BEL shows clinical efficacy on non-approved manifestations, but careful patient selection is warranted.",

In a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial, 43 patients with recurrent or refractory LN were treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide (CYC), and glucocorticoids followed by weekly belimumab infusions until week 48 (RCB group), or treated with rituximab and CYC but no belimumab infusions (RC group). Patients were followed up until week 96. Percentages of total and autoreactive B cell subsets in the patients' peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. Treatment with belimumab did not increase the incidence of adverse events in patients with refractory LN. At week 48, a complete or partial renal response occurred in 11 (52%) of 21 patients receiving belimumab, compared to 9 (41%) of 22 patients in the RC group who did not receive belimumab (P = 0.452). Lack of improvement in or worsening of LN was the major reason for treatment failure. B cell depletion occurred in both groups, but the percentage of B cells remained lower in those receiving belimumab (geometric mean number of B cells at week 60, 53 cells/\u03bcl in the RCB group versus 11 cells/\u03bcl in the RC group; P = 0.0012). Percentages of total and autoreactive transitional B cells increased from baseline to week 48 in both groups. However, percentages of total and autoreactive naive B cells decreased from baseline to week 48 in the belimumab group compared to the no belimumab RC group (P = 0.0349), a finding that is consistent with the observed impaired maturation of naive B cells and enhanced censoring of autoreactive B cells. The addition of belimumab to a treatment regimen with rituximab and CYC was safe in patients with refractory LN. This regimen diminished maturation of transitional to naive B cells during B cell reconstitution, and enhanced the negative selection of autoreactive B cells. Clinical efficacy was not improved with rituximab and CYC in combination with belimumab when compared to a therapeutic strategy of B cell depletion alone in patients with LN.",

On the other hand, gut microbiota produce both isomers, which can then flow into the body. Although both d-lactate and l-lactate can contribute to energy metabolism, their potential roles in adipocyte differentiation remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of l-lactate and d-lactate on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Both lactate enantiomers were demonstrated to enhance triglyceride accumulation by stimulating the early phase of adipocyte differentiation. Notably, d-lactate was more potent than l-lactate in inducing triglyceride accumulation. The degree of triglyceride accumulation induced by l-lactate was similar to that induced by pyruvate. d-Lactate was more potent than l-lactate in increasing the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Both lactate enantiomers did not affect cell viability. Moreover, both enantiomers upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) \u03b1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, and fatty acid synthase, with d-lactate exerting stronger effects than l-lactate. By contrast, lactate did not influence the expression of C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4. d-Lactate significantly increased and l-lactate tended to increase p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 inhibited the stimulation of adipocyte differentiation by d-lactate and l-lactate. These findings showed that both lactate enantiomers stimulate preadipocyte differentiation, with d-lactate showing more potent effects than l-lactate.

Interestingly, the d-lactate isomer, exclusively produced locally by gut or cervicovaginal microbiota, was found to be more potent than the l-isomer. Interestingly, neither of the strong histone deacetylase inhibitors [structurally similar butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)] was as effective in the stimulation of IL-13 production as d-lactate. Lactate transport through monocarboxylate transporters was required for lactate-enhanced IL-13 production in a manner that was not hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1-dependent. Furthermore, lactate treatment increased the acetylation of GATA-3, a critical regulator of Th1/Th2 differentiation and resulted in H3 and H4 histone hyperacetylation state, which is a characteristic feature of transcriptionally active chromatin. Both lactate isomers also enhanced IL4 and IL13 promoter-driven activity of reporter constructs in murine and human cells.

We mapped the developmental origin of four key CX subtypes and found that neurons with similar origin have similar axon/dendrite targeting. Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless loss simultaneously produces ectopic P-EN neurons with normal axon/dendrite projections, and reduces the number of E-PG neurons. Furthermore, transient loss of Eyeless during development impairs adult flies' capacity to perform celestial navigation.

Ey promoter binding was correlated with the active transcription of genes involved in development and transcription regulation. An integrative analysis revealed that Ey directly regulated a broad and highly connected genetic network, including many essential patterning pathways, and known and novel eye genes. Interestingly, we observed that Ey could target multiple components of the same pathway, which might enhance its control of these pathways during eye development. In addition to protein-coding genes, we discovered Ey also targeted non-coding RNAs, which represents a new regulatory mechanism employed by Ey. These findings suggest that Ey could use multiple molecular mechanisms to regulate target gene expression and pathway function, which might enable Ey to exhibit a greater flexibility in controlling different processes during eye development.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993201": "Pax6 transcription factors are essential upstream regulators in the developing anterior brain and peripheral visual system of most bilaterian animals. While a single homolog is in charge of these functions in vertebrates, two Pax6 genes are in Drosophila: eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy). At first glance, their co-existence seems sufficiently explained by their differential involvement in the specification of two types of insect visual organs: the lateral compound eyes (ey) and the dorsal ocelli (toy). Less straightforward to understand, however, is their genetic redundancy in promoting defined early and late growth phases of the precursor tissue to these organs: the eye-antennal imaginal disc. Drawing on comparative sequence, expression, and gene function evidence, I here conclude that this gene regulatory network module dates back to the dawn of arthropod evolution, securing the embryonic development of the ocular head segment. Thus, ey and toy constitute a paradigm to explore the organization and functional significance of longterm conserved genetic redundancy of duplicated genes. Indeed, as first steps in this direction, recent studies uncovered the shared use of binding sites in shared enhancers of target genes that are under redundant (string) and, strikingly, even subfunctionalized control by ey and toy (atonal). Equally significant, the evolutionarily recent and paralog-specific function of ey to repress the transcription of the antenna fate regulator Distal-less offers a functionally and phylogenetically well-defined opportunity to study the reconciliation of shared, partitioned, and newly acquired functions in a duplicated developmental gene pair.",

Eye development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is driven by the highly conserved selector gene network referred to as the \"retinal determination gene network,\" composed of approximately 20 factors, whose core comprises twin of eyeless (toy), eyeless (ey), sine oculis (so), dachshund (dac), and eyes absent (eya). These genes encode transcriptional regulators that are each necessary for normal eye development, and sufficient to direct ectopic eye development when misexpressed. While it is well documented that the downstream genes so, eya, and dac are necessary not only during early growth and determination stages but also during the differentiation phase of retinal development, it remains unknown how the retinal determination gene network terminates its functions in determination and begins to promote differentiation. Here, we identify a switch in the regulation of ey by the downstream retinal determination genes, which is essential for the transition from determination to differentiation. We found that central to the transition is a switch from positive regulation of ey transcription to negative regulation and that both types of regulation require so. Our results suggest a model in which the retinal determination gene network is rewired to end the growth and determination stage of eye development and trigger terminal differentiation. We conclude that changes in the regulatory relationships among members of the retinal determination gene network are a driving force for key transitions in retinal development.",

Despite the characterization of mutations in Pax6 homologs in a range of organisms, and despite functional studies, it remains unclear what the relative importance is of the various parts of the Pax6 protein. To address this, we have studied the Drosophila Pax6 homolog eyeless. Specifically, we have generated new eyeless alleles, each with single missense mutations in one of the four domains of the protein. We show that these alleles result in abnormal eye and brain development while maintaining the OK107 eyeless GAL4 activity from which they were derived. We performed in vivo functional rescue experiments by expressing in an eyeless-specific pattern Eyeless proteins in which either the paired domain, the homeodomain, or the C-terminal domain was deleted. Rescue of the eye and brain phenotypes was only observed when full-length Eyeless was expressed, while all deletion constructs failed to rescue. These data, along with the phenotypes observed in the four newly characterized eyeless alleles, demonstrate the requirement for an intact Eyeless protein for normal Drosophila eye and brain development.

In both cases, ectopic eye structures are formed. To understand the genetic program specifying eye morphogenesis, we have analyzed the regulatory mechanisms of Pax 6 expression that initiates eye development. Previously, we have demonstrated that Notch signaling regulates the expression of eyeless and twin of eyeless in Drosophila. Here, we show that in Xenopus, activation of Notch signaling also induces eye-related gene expression, including Pax 6, in isolated animal caps. In Xenopus embryos, the activation of Notch signaling causes eye duplications and proximal eye defects, which are also induced by overexpression of eyeless and twin of eyeless.

Most animals possess a singleton Pax6 ortholog, but the dependence of eye development on Pax6 is widely conserved. A rare exception is given by the larval eyes of Drosophila, which develop independently of ey and toy. To obtain insight into the origin of differential larval and adult eye regulation, we studied the function of toy and ey in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. We find that single and combinatorial knockdown of toy and ey affect larval eye development strongly but adult eye development only mildly in this primitive hemimetabolous species. Compound eye-loss, however, was provoked when ey and toy were RNAi-silenced in combination with the early retinal gene dachshund (dac). We propose that these data reflect a role of Pax6 during regional specification in the developing head and that the subsequent maintenance and growth of the adult eye primordium is regulated partly by redundant and partly by specific functions of toy, ey and dac in Tribolium. The results from embryonic knockdown and comparative protein sequence analysis lead us further to conclude that Tribolium represents an ancestral state of redundant control by ey and toy.",

Even though the Paired domains of TOY and SEY have DNA-binding properties that differ from those of the Paired domain of EY, they all are capable of inducing ectopic eye development in an ey mutant background. We also show that one of the main functional differences between toy and ey lies in the C-terminal region of their protein products, implying differences in their transactivation potential. Furthermore, we show that only the homeodomain (HD) of EY is able to downregulate the expression of Distal-less (Dll), a feature that is required during endogenous eye development.

It functions as an essential regulator of eye development in both Drosophila and vertebrates, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved origin for different types of metazoan eyes. Classical morphological and phylogenetic studies, however, have concluded that metazoan eyes have evolved many times independently. These apparently contradictory findings may be reconciled if the evolutionarily ancient role of Pax-6 was to regulate structural genes (e.g., rhodopsin) in primitive photoreceptors, and only later did it expand its function to regulate the morphogenesis of divergent and complex eye structures. In support of this, we present evidence that eyeless (ey), which encodes the Drosophila homolog of Pax-6, directly regulates rhodopsin 1 (rh1) expression in the photoreceptor cells. We detect ey expression in both larval and adult terminally differentiated photoreceptor cells. We show that the HD of Ey binds to a palindromic HD binding site P3/RCS1 in the rh1 promoter, which is essential for rh1 expression. We further demonstrate that, in vivo, P3/RCS1 can be replaced by binding sites specific for the PD of Ey. P3/RCS1 is conserved in the promoters of all Drosophila rhodopsin genes as well as in many opsin genes in vertebrates. Mutimerized P3 sites in front of a basal promoter are able to drive the expression of a reporter gene in all photoreceptors.

The embryonic visual system consists of the optic lobe primordium, which, during later larval life, develops into the prominent optic lobe neuropiles, and the larval photoreceptor (Bolwig's organ). Both structures derive from a neurectodermal placode in the embryonic head. Expression of tll is normally confined to the optic lobe primordium, whereas ato appears in a subset of Bolwig's organ cells that we call Bolwig's organ founders. Phenotypic analysis, using specific markers for Bolwig's organ and the optic lobe, of tll loss- and gain-of-function mutant embryos reveals that tll functions to drive cells to optic lobe as opposed to Bolwig's organ fate. Similar experiments indicate that ato has the opposite effect, namely driving cells to a Bolwig's organ fate. Since we can show that tll and ato do not regulate each other, we propose a model wherein tll expression restricts the ability of cells to respond to signaling arising from ato-expressing Bolwig's organ pioneers. Our data further suggest that the Bolwig's organ founder cells produce Spitz (the Drosophila TGFalpha homolog) signal, which is passed to the neighboring secondary Bolwig's organ cells where it activates the EGFR signaling cascade and maintains the fate of these secondary cells. The regulators of tll expression in the embryonic visual system remain elusive, as we were unable to find evidence for regulation by the 'early eye genes' so, eya and ey, or by EGFR signaling.",

Moreover, we show that the Dachshund and Eyes Absent proteins can physically interact through conserved domains, suggesting a molecular basis for the genetic synergy observed and that a similar complex may function in mammals.

Mutations in Pax6 function result in eye malformations known as Aniridia in humans and Small eye syndrome in mice. The Drosophila homologue of Pax6, eyeless, is also necessary for correct invertebrate eye development, and its misexpression leads to formation of ectopic eyes in Drosophila. Here we show that a conserved vertebrate homeobox gene, Rx, is essential for normal eye development, and that its misexpression has profound effects on eye morphology. Xenopus embryos injected with synthetic Rx RNA develop ectopic retinal tissue and display hyperproliferation in the neuroretina.

Previous work has demonstrated the existence of a functional network and genetic regulatory hierarchy in Drosophila in which eyeless (ey, the Pax6 orthologue), eyes absent (eya), and dac operate together to regulate Drosophila eye development, and that ey regulates the expression of eya and dac. We find that in the developing eye of both chick and mouse, expression domains of Dach1 overlap with those of Pax6, a gene required for normal eye development. Similarly, in the developing ear of both mouse and chick, Dach1 expression overlaps with the expression of another Pax gene, Pax2. In the mouse, Dach1 expression in the developing ear also overlaps with the expression of Eya1 (an eya homologue). Both Pax2 and Eya1 are required for normal ear development. Our expression studies suggest that the Drosophila Pax-eya-dac regulatory network may be evolutionarily conserved such that Pax genes, Eya1, and Dach1 may function together in vertebrates to regulate neural development. To address the further possibility that a regulatory hierarchy exists between Pax, Eya, and Dach genes, we have examined the expression of mouse Dach1 in Pax6, Pax2 and Eya1 mutant backgrounds.

Furthermore, severe defects in adult brain structures essential for vision, olfaction, and for the coordination of locomotion are provoked by two newly isolated mutations of Pax-6/eyeless that result in truncated proteins. Consistent with the morphological lesions, we observe defective walking behavior for these eyeless mutants. The implications of these data for understanding postembryonic brain development and function in Drosophila are discussed.",

Not only is ey required for eye development, but its misexpression can convert many other tissues into eye, including legs, wings and antennae.(1) ey is remarkable for its ability to drive coordinate differentiation of the multiple cell types that have to differentiate in a very precise pattern to construct the fly eye, and for its power to override the previous differentiation programs of many other diverse tissues. Even more remarkable, the ey homolog Pax6 and homologs of other eye determination genes from Drosophila are also required for eye development in vertebrates,(2,3) prompting reassessment of the evolution of vision throughout the animal kingdom.(4,5) Now Kumar and Moses have published a study that throws a new light on ey function in Drosophila.(6) According to their work, ey becomes a master regulator of eye development much later than previously thought, and is regulated by signalling through the Notch and EGFR signaling pathways.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21208993": "In the developing Drosophila optic lobe, eyeless, apterous and distal-less, three genes that encode transcription factors with important functions during development, are expressed in broad subsets of medulla neurons. Medulla cortex cells follow two patterns of cell movements to acquire their final position: first, neurons are arranged in columns below each neuroblast. Then, during pupation, they migrate laterally, intermingling with each other to reach their retinotopic position in the adult optic lobe. eyeless, which encodes a Pax6 transcription factor, is expressed early in progenitors and controls aspects of this cell migration. Its loss in medulla neurons leads to overgrowth and a failure of lateral migration during pupation. These defects in cell migration among medulla cortex cells can be rescued by removing DE-Cadherin. Thus, eyeless links neurogenesis and neuronal migration.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7892602": "The Drosophila gene eyeless (ey) encodes a transcription factor with both a paired domain and a homeodomain. It is homologous to the mouse Small eye (Pax-6) gene and to the Aniridia gene in humans. These genes share extensive sequence identity, the position of three intron splice sites is conserved, and these genes are expressed similarly in the developing nervous system and in the eye during morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in both the insect and in the mammalian genes have been shown to lead to a reduction or absence of eye structures, which suggests that ey functions in eye morphogenesis. By targeted expression of the ey complementary DNA in various imaginal disc primordia of Drosophila, ectopic eye structures were induced on the wings, the legs, and on the antennae. The ectopic eyes appeared morphologically normal and consisted of groups of fully differentiated ommatidia with a complete set of photoreceptor cells. These results support the proposition that ey is the master control gene for eye morphogenesis. Because homologous genes are present in vertebrates, ascidians, insects, cephalopods, and nemerteans, ey may function as a master control gene throughout the metazoa.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11685574": "Eye specification in Drosophila is thought be controlled by a set of seven nuclear factors that includes the Pax6 homolog, Eyeless. This group of genes is conserved throughout evolution and has been repeatedly recruited for eye specification. Several of these genes are expressed within the developing eyes of vertebrates and mutations in several mouse and human orthologs are the underlying causes of retinal disease syndromes. Ectopic expression in Drosophila of any one of these genes is capable of inducing retinal development, while loss-of-function mutations delete the developing eye. These nuclear factors comprise a complex regulatory network and it is thought that their combined activities are required for the formation of the eye. We examined the expression patterns of four eye specification genes, eyeless (ey), sine oculis (so), eyes absent (eya), and dachshund (dac) throughout all time points of embryogenesis and show that only eyeless is expressed within the embryonic eye anlagen. This is consistent with a recently proposed model in which the eye primordium acquires its competence to become retinal tissue over several time points of development. We also compare the expression of Ey with that of a putative antennal specifying gene Distal-less (Dll). The expression patterns described here are quite intriguing and raise the possibility that these genes have even earlier and wide ranging roles in establishing the head and visual field.",

Among these, the Drosophila Pax-6 gene eyeless (ey) plays a major role. ey has been considered a master control gene of eye development in the animal kingdom because targeted expression of ey and vertebrate as well as invertebrate homologs lead to the formation of ectopic eyes in Drosophila. We demonstrate that an intron of the ey gene contains an enhancer that regulates the eye specific expression of the gene in the eye disc primordia of embryos and in the eye imaginal discs of third instar larvae. Moreover, a 212-bp enhancer element is necessary and sufficient for the enhancer function. It is partially conserved in Drosophila hydei and contains putative Pax-6 Paired domain binding sites. We show that several binding sites are required for the eye specific expression, and, therefore, we propose a Pax-6-like molecule to be a positive transactivator for the eye specific ey expression. This transactivator recently has been identified as twin of eyeless, the second Pax-6 gene in Drosophila.",

Members of one subclass, Pax6, function as selector genes and play key roles in the retinal development of all seeing animals. Mutations within the Pax6 homologs including fly eyeless, mouse Small eye and human Pax6 lead to severe retinal defects in their respective systems. In Drosophila eyeless and twin of eyeless, play non-redundant roles in the developing retina. One particularly interesting characteristic of these genes is that, although expression of either gene can induce ectopic eye formation in non-retinal tissues, there are differences in the location and frequencies at which the eyes develop. eyeless induces much larger ectopic eyes, at higher frequencies, and in a broader range of tissues than twin of eyeless. In this report we describe a series of experiments conducted in both yeast and flies that has identified protein modules that are responsible for the differences in tissue transformation. These domains appear to contain transcriptional activator and repressor activity of distinct strengths. We propose a model in which the selective presence of these activities and their relative strengths accounts, in part, for the disparity to which ectopic eyes are induced in response to the forced expression of eyeless and twin of eyeless. The identification of both transcriptional activator and repressor activity within the Pax6 protein furthers our understanding of how this gene family regulates tissue determination.",

Toy is more similar to vertebrate Pax-6 proteins than Ey with regard to overall sequence conservation, DNA-binding function, and early expression in the embryo, toy and ey share a similar expression pattern in the developing visual system, and targeted expression of Toy, like Ey, induces the formation of ectopic eyes. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates, however, that Toy functions upstream of ey by directly regulating the eye-specific enhancer of ey. Toy is therefore required for initiation of ey expression in the embryo and acts through Ey to activate the eye developmental program.",

Strong mutants of twin of eyeless or of eyeless are headless, which suggests that they are required for the development of all structures derived from eye-antennal discs. The activity of these genes is crucial at the very beginning of eye-antennal development in the primordia of eye-antennal discs when eyeless is first activated by the twin of eyeless gene product. This activation does not strictly depend on the Twin of eyeless protein, but is temperature-dependent in its absence. Twin of eyeless acts also in parallel to the eyeless gene and exerts functions that are partially redundant with those of Eyeless, while Eyeless is mainly required to prevent early cell death and promote eye development in eye-antennal discs.",

Estimates of promoter function were obtained by creating versions of CaMV 35S and CsVMV BDDPs that contained reporter marker genes encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) interchangeably linked either to the upstream or downstream core promoters. GUS was used for quantitative analysis of promoter function, whereas, EGFP allowed visual qualitative evaluation. In addition, the GUS and EGFP genes placed in downstream positions were modified by translational fusion with neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) to allow simultaneous monitoring of promoter activity and selection of stable transformants. These versions of BDDP were compared with each other and with equivalent unidirectional constructs by evaluating their expression in grape and tobacco. For 35S promoter constructs tested in grape somatic embryos (SE), BDDP exhibited transient GUS expression 206- and 300-fold greater in downstream and upstream configurations, respectively, compared to a unidirectional 35S core promoter. Compared with a unidirectional double enhanced 35S promoter, BDDPs exhibited 0.5- and 3-fold increased GUS expression from downstream and upstream core promoters, respectively. The same differences in expression levels determined quantitatively with GUS were distinguished qualitatively with EGFP. Constructs using CsVMV core promoters yielded results relative to those obtained with 35S promoter. For example, the upstream BDDP CsVMV core promoter provided a 200-fold increase in GUS expression compared to a unidirectional core promoter. However, CsVMV promoter was found to have higher promoter activity than 35S promoter in both BDDP and unidirectional constructs. Incorporation of an additional duplicated enhancer element to BDDPs resulted in increased expression. For example, a 35S BDDP with two divergently arranged duplicated enhancer elements resulted in over a 6-fold increase in GUS expression in stably transformed tobacco plants compared to a BDDP with one duplicated enhancer element. Data demonstrate that BDDP composed of divergently-arranged core promoters separated by duplicated enhancers, all derived from a single promoter sequence, can be used to significantly enhance transgene expression and to direct synchronized expression of multiple transgenes.",

The long inverted repeats of Marek's Disease virus serotype 1 (MDV1) genome contain closely located transcriptional promoters for phosphorylated protein pp38/pp24 and 1.8 kb-mRNA. These promoters initiate transcription in opposite directions and are separated only by a short enhancer region, which is likely to regulate both promoters simultaneously. We have analyzed the transcription activity of these promoters in MDV1 (Md5 strain) infected CEF by transient expression of CAT reporter genes and found that the promoters were in fact active in infected cells and the promoter for 1.8 kb-mRNA was more active than the pp38/pp24 promoter. Deletion analysis of the short enhancer region revealed that the 30 bp region overlapping the enhancer elements for 1.8 kb-mRNA was important for promoter activity for pp38/pp24. The gel shift analysis revealed that nuclear factor(s) actually bound to the overlapping 30 bp region. In addition, the activity of these promoters in infected cells varied with MDV strains. These results suggest that pp38/pp24 and 1.8 kb-mRNA promoters share a common regulatory sequence but a viral or a cellular factor(s) induced by viral infection regulates the promoter by distinct mechanisms.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the associations among Gas6, adipocytokines and insulin resistance in adipocytes. Mature Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome adipocytes were treated with high levels of insulin to mimic insulin resistance, and were examined for the expressions of Gas6, cytokines and adipocytokines from preadipocytes in differentiation. In an animal study, high-fat diet-induced obese mice were used to verify the Gas6 expression in vitro. During the differentiation of adipocytes, the expression of Gas6 gradually decreased, and was obviously downregulated with adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance. Gas6 levels were found to be in proportion to the expression of adiponectin, which has been regarded as closely relevant to improved insulin sensitivity after metformin treatment.

Animal studies revealed that VK supplementation dose-dependently upregulated plasma cGas6; stimulated the protein expression of cGas6, PI3K, pAKT, and GLUT4 in skeletal muscle; and reduced hyperglycemia in HFD-fed T2D mice. And in vitro mRNA knockdown studies demonstrated the requirement of cGas6 in mediating the positive effect of VK on glucose metabolism via stimulating the PI3K/pAKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway in high glucose-treated myotubes.

Association between DAS28 response and TNF-308 (rs1800629) genotype (P = 0.001) was detected across the whole cohort.

The aim here was to identify clinical variables that are easily assessed in clinical practice which are associated with a major response to rituximab (moderate to good EULAR response, according to DAS28 values) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to anti-TNF agents or traditional DMARDs. Rituximab (2x1g, two weeks apart) was administered to 108 patients in four different Spanish hospitals. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved a major response at six months. Potential predictors of a major response were identified using multivariate binary logistic regression models. At six months of treatment 75.9% of patients achieved a major response (24% good and 52% moderate). Comparing the clinical features at baseline between patients who did or did not achieve a major response, significant differences were found in rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP positivity, as well as in the number of failed anti-TNF agents prior to rituximab. While rituximab delivers clinical benefit in seronegative patients, the presence of RF and/or anti-CCP consistently enriches clinical responses. The multivariate analysis showed that the best model for predicting a major EULAR response to rituximab was comprised of the following two variables: the anti-CCP antibody positivity (p=0.045) and the number of previous anti-TNF agents used (p=0.028). Using a cut-off level for CCP of 300 U/ml we found that patients with an anti-CCP titre &gt;300 U/ml were 3-4 times more likely to achieve a major EULAR response [odds ratio (OR): 3.38; 95% CI: 1.025-11.17]. By contrast, those patients who had failed to respond to 2 or more anti-TNF agents had a 72.5% lower probability of achieving a moderate to good EULAR response (OR: 0.275; 95% CI: 0.087-0.871) than did patients who had only failed to respond to one such agent. A lower number of previously-failed TNF blockers and high anti-CCP titre can help select the best candidates for RTX therapy in patients with RA.",

Agreement between the criteria sets was investigated using kappa statistics in a non-randomized cohort of 1789 RA patients from southern Sweden, starting their first course of anti-TNF-treatment. Mean disease duration was 12 years. Completer analysis was used. Agreement between high, moderate and low activity states was moderate or substantial, with kappa = 0.5 or better for all criteria. Agreement between SDAI and CDAI disease states was &gt; 90% in these categories with kappa &gt; 0.8. DAS28 original and modified cut point remission had good agreement (kappa = 0.91). Agreement between responses was substantial at the overall/ACR20 level (about 95%, kappa = 0.7 or better) for all criteria. By contrast, agreement was poor between moderate and high level responses. Disease activity states according to the various indices perform similarly and show substantial agreement at all levels except remission. Agreement between SDAI and CDAI states is excellent. Response criteria, applied at the individual patient level, are hard to interpret and show poor agreement, except at the lowest level of response.

However, there remains a proportion of patients who do not improve despite therapy. These drugs are expensive and have the potential of serious toxicity. Therefore, it would be ideal to predict the patients who will respond, so that the use of these drugs can be targetted. To identify the clinical factors present at the start of anti-TNF-alpha therapy that are associated with response at 6 months in patients with RA. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) Biologics Register collects detailed data on all patients with a rheumatic disease receiving biologic therapy in the UK. We studied all patients with RA who had started etanercept (ETA) or infliximab (INF) and had achieved a minimum 6 months follow-up by 1 October, 2004. The disease status at the baseline and at 6 months was assessed using the Disease Activity Score (DAS28). The response was classified according to the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) improvement criteria. The effect of baseline characteristics on response was studied using multivariate ordinal logistic regression. 2879 patients were included in this analysis (1267 ETA, 1612 INF). At the start of therapy, the mean age was 55 yrs, disease duration 14 yrs, baseline DAS28 6.7 and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) 2.1. In all, 28% of ETA and 86% of INF patients were receiving methotrexate. After 6 months, 18% had a good EULAR response, of whom 9% were considered to be in remission and 50% had a moderate response. There was no overall difference in response rate between the two anti-TNF-alpha therapies. A higher baseline HAQ score correlated with a lower response rate while a better response was associated with the current use of NSAIDs and the use of methotrexate (MTX), although the latter only reached statistical significance with ETA [OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.38-2.40)]. There was a lower response rate among current smokers, particularly in patients receiving INF [OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.60-0.99)]. Age, disease duration, rheumatoid factor and the previous number of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) did not predict response to either drug. However, females were less likely to achieve remission. These data support an improved outcome among patients receiving MTX in combination with anti-TNF-alpha therapies. However, the most disabled patients were less likely to respond, despite concurrent MTX. The benefits of NSAIDs may reflect the relative absence of comorbidities in patients who can tolerate these drugs or the continuing presence of reversible inflammatory symptoms. The association of smoking and poor outcome with INF is a novel finding and may reflect alterations in pharmacokinetics. The inability of other baseline disease characteristics to predict the outcome suggests that other factors, including potential genetic differences in drug metabolism, may be influencing the response to anti-TNF-alpha therapies.",

Dynamic prospective cohort study of patients with RA treated with anti-TNF under clinical practice conditions. Effectiveness was evaluated using Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and time to treatment failure. Prior adherence was evaluated retrospectively and safety was evaluated by adverse events (AE). The analysis was restricted to anti-TNF-naive patients. The study included 161 patients treated for RA during 6 years (60 infliximab, 79 etanercept, and 22 adalimumab). At 6 months, 15% reached a good EULAR response and 38% a moderate response. A mean decrease of -1.5 (p &lt; 0.0001) was observed in the DAS28 and of -0.34 in the HAQ (p &lt; 0.0001); however, women showed poorer progress in terms of DAS and HAQ. In the first year, 64.3% did not experience treatment failure and this figure was 50.5% after 2 years. In one-third, glucocorticoids were withdrawn and in the remainder the dose was reduced by 50%. Adherence to treatment, selection of etanercept, and intensification of infliximab were associated with a lower probability of premature failure in the multivariate model. AE were similar to other those in studies and no outstanding differences in safety were found between the 3 anti-TNF therapies. Anti-TNF treatments are effective and safe, reducing the activity of the disease, disability, and the need for corticosteroids. Patients who displayed good adherence prior to the anti-TNF treatment and were treated with etanercept or with increasing doses of infliximab had the best chance of displaying a response.",

The authors hypothesise that this may be genetically determined. In other complex diseases, susceptibility genes have been shown to influence treatment response. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of markers within confirmed RA susceptibility loci with the response to anti-TNF treatment. Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to 11 genetic loci were genotyped in 1012 patients with RA receiving treatment with etanercept, infliximab or adalimumab. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed using the absolute change in 28 joint count disease activity score (DAS28) between baseline and 6-month follow-up as the outcome variable, adjusting for confounders. p Values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant and associated markers were genotyped in an additional 322 samples. Analysis was performed in the combined cohort of 1334 subjects with RA treated with anti-TNF. In the combined analysis, SNPs mapping to AFF3 and CD226 had a statistically significant association with the response to anti-TNF treatment under an additive model. The G allele at rs10865035, mapping to AFF3, was associated with an improved response to anti-TNF treatment (coefficient -0.14 (95% CI -0.25 to -0.03), p=0.015). At the CD226 SNP rs763361, the C allele conferred reduced response to treatment (coefficient 0.11 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.22), p=0.048). These results suggest that AFF3 and CD226, two confirmed RA susceptibility genes, have an additional role in influencing the response to anti-TNF treatment.",

After 6 months of treatment, the patients were classified as being in remission (DAS28 &lt;2.6), having low disease activity (LDA; DAS28 2.6-3.2), or not responding (NR: DAS28 &gt;3.2). The patients were also tested for serum antidrug antibodies and IgG4 antibodies against TNF inhibitors. After 24 weeks of treatment, 38% of the ETN-treated patients and 28% of those treated with ADA had injection-site reactions; the rate of systemic reactions in the IFX group was 25%. The differences among the three groups were not statistically significant (P=0.382; ETN versus ADA P=0.319).

Associations between antidrug antibodies, specific IgG4 antibodies, and adverse reactions were not significant for any of the three drugs. IgG4 levels were higher in the ADA group than in the other two groups, and higher in the patients with worse DAS28 (NR) and in those experiencing adverse events. These data suggest a possible association between IgG4 levels and worse DAS28 (r (2)=5.8%, P=0.011). The presence of specific IgG4 antibodies against TNF blockers in patients with RA might affect the drugs' activity.

Attempts to identify molecular biomarkers predicting response have met with mixed success. This may be attributable, in part, to the variable and subjective disease assessment endpoints with large placebo effects typically used to classify patient response. Sixty-one patients with active RA despite methotrexate treatment, and with MRI-documented synovitis, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo. Blood was collected at baseline and genome-wide transcription in whole blood was measured using microarrays. The primary endpoint in this study was determined by measuring the transfer rate constant (Ktrans) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent from plasma to synovium using MRI. Secondary endpoints included repeated clinical assessments with DAS28(CRP), and assessments of osteitis and synovitis by the RAMRIS method. Infliximab showed greater decrease from baseline in DCE-MRI Ktrans of wrist and MCP at all visits compared with placebo (P&lt;0.001). Statistical analysis was performed to identify genes associated with treatment-specific 14-week change in Ktrans. The 256 genes identified were used to derive a gene signature score by averaging their log expression within each patient. The resulting score correlated with improvement of Ktrans in infliximab-treated patients and with deterioration of Ktrans in placebo-treated subjects. Poor responders showed high expression of activated B-cell genes whereas good responders exhibited a gene expression pattern consistent with mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes and high levels of reticulated platelets. This gene signature was significantly associated with clinical response in two previously published whole blood gene expression studies using anti-TNF therapies. These data provide support for the hypothesis that anti-TNF inadequate responders comprise a distinct molecular subtype of RA characterized by differences in pre-treatment blood mRNA expression. They also highlight the importance of placebo controls and robust, objective endpoints in biomarker discovery.

They were also measured in synovial fluids from 17 TNF inhibitor-na\u00efve patients, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in-culture from 6 patients and correlated with various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Serum levels of IL-33 at 6 months after treatment decreased significantly in responders, while they did not change in non-responders. Synovial fluid levels of IL-33 in 6 patients under treatment with TNF inhibitors stayed high in 3 who were refractory and slightly elevated in 2 moderate responders, while they were undetectable in one patient under remission. Among inflammatory cytokines measured in 17 synovial fluids from TNF inhibitor-na\u00efve patients, levels of IL-33 showed a significant positive correlation only to those of IL-1\u03b2. IL-1\u03b2 increased IL-33 expression markedly in FLS in vitro, compared to TNF-\u03b1. IL-1\u03b2 might be inducing RA inflammation through producing pro-inflammatory IL-33 in TNF inhibitor-hypo-responders. Sustained elevation of serum and/or synovial levels of IL-33 may account for a poor response to TNF inhibitors, although how TNF inhibitors affect the level of IL-33 remains to be elucidated.",

Here we describe a syndrome of BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (BRIDA) that results from BACH2 haploinsufficiency. Affected subjects had lymphocyte-maturation defects that caused immunoglobulin deficiency and intestinal inflammation. The mutations disrupted protein stability by interfering with homodimerization or by causing aggregation. We observed analogous lymphocyte defects in Bach2-heterozygous mice. More generally, we observed that genes that cause monogenic haploinsufficient diseases were substantially enriched for TFs and SE architecture. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of SE architecture in Mendelian diseases of immunity: heterozygous mutations in SE-regulated genes identified by whole-exome/genome sequencing may have greater significance than previously recognized.",

Cerebrolysin, a brain-specific proposed pleiotropic neuroprotective agent, has been suggested to improve global functional outcomes in ischemic stroke. We investigated the efficacy, safety and feasibility of administering Cerebrolysin for SAH patients. This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, parallel-group pilot study. Fifty patients received either daily Cerebrolysin (30 ml/day) or a placebo (saline) for 14 days (25 patients per study group). The primary endpoint was a favorable Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) of 5 to 8 (moderate disability to good recovery) at six-months. Secondary endpoints included the modified Ranking Scale (mRS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score, occurrence of adverse effects and the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). No severe adverse effects or mortality attributable to Cerebrolysin were observed. No significant difference was detected in the proportion of patients with favorable six-month GOSE in either study group (odds ratio (OR): 1.49; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-5.17). Secondary functional outcome measures for favorable six-month recovery i.e. a mRS of 0 to 3 (OR: 3.45; 95% CI 0.79-15.01) were comparable for both groups. Similarly, there was no difference in MOCA neurocognitive performance (p-value: 0.75) and in the incidence of DCI (OR: 0.85 95% CI: 0.28-2.59). Use of Cerebrolysin in addition to standard-of-care management of aneurysmal SAH is safe, well tolerated and feasible. However, the neutral results of this trial suggest that it does not improve the six-month global functional performance of patients.

Subgroup analyses were performed according to Hunt and Hess grade (good grade \u2264 2, N = 216; poor grade \u2265 3, N = 246) and treatment procedure (clip or coil). In good-grade patients (N = 216), clinical outcomes and mortality did not differ significantly between the control and Cerebrolysin groups. In poor-grade patients (N = 246), the mortality rate was significantly lower in the Cerebrolysin group (8.7%) than in the control group (25.4%, p = 0.006). In patients who received microsurgical clipping (N = 328), the mortality rate was significantly lower in the Cerebrolysin group (7.3%) than in the control group (18.5%, p = 0.016).

Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool; and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free, maintains the integrity of BEVs and ensures reproducibility through the use of automated liquid handlers. Post-separation BEVs are characterized using orthogonal biochemical endotoxin and Toll-like receptor-based reporter assays in combination with proteomics, electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to evaluate BEV quality, abundance, structure and molecular cargo. Separation and characterization of BEVs from body fluids can be done within 72 h, is compatible with EEV analysis and can be readily adopted by researchers experienced in basic molecular biology and extracellular vesicle analysis. We anticipate that this protocol will expand our knowledge on the biological heterogeneity, molecular cargo and function of BEVs in human body fluids and steer the development of laboratory research tools and clinical diagnostic kits.",

Our evidence suggests that insulin is specifically used as a weapon for prey capture by a subset of fish-hunting cone snails that use a net strategy to capture prey. Insulin appears to be a component of the nirvana cabal, a toxin combination in these venoms that is released into the water to disorient schools of small fish, making them easier to engulf with the snail's distended false mouth, which functions as a net. If an entire school of fish simultaneously experiences hypoglycemic shock, this should directly facilitate capture by the predatory snail.",

We recently showed that this venom insulin, Con-Ins G1, has unique characteristics relevant to the design of new insulin therapeutics. Here, we show that fish-hunting cone snails provide a rich source of minimized ligands of the vertebrate insulin receptor. Insulins from <i>C. geographus</i>, <i>Conus tulipa</i> and <i>Conus kinoshitai</i> exhibit diverse sequences, yet all bind to and activate the human insulin receptor. Molecular dynamics reveal unique modes of action that are distinct from any other insulins known in nature. When tested in zebrafish and mice, venom insulins significantly lower blood glucose in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes. Our findings suggest that cone snails have evolved diverse strategies to activate the vertebrate insulin receptor and provide unique insight into the design of novel drugs for the treatment of diabetes.",

The amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined and verified by chemical synthesis. The peptide has 4 residues of the modified amino acid, gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The sequence of the peptide is: Gly-Glu-Gla-Gla-Tyr-Gln-Lys-Met-Leu-Gla-Asn-Leu-Arg-Gla-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys- Lys-Asn-Ala-NH2. Conantokin-T inhibits N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated calcium influx in central nervous system neurons. This observation suggests that like conantokin-G (a homologous Conus peptide with recently identified NMDA antagonist activity) conantokin-T has NMDA antagonist activity. A sequence comparison of conantokins-T and -G identifies the 4 Gla residues and the N-terminal dipeptide sequence as potential key elements for the biological activity of this peptide.",

Superfusion of conantokin-T (1-500 nM) specifically and irreversibly decreased the pharmacologically isolated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPNMDA) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on normal excitatory synaptic transmission (EPSP). The sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons to NMDA but not to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid was also antagonized by conantokin-T pretreatment. In addition, the conantokin-T-induced depression of EPSPNMDA could be antagonized by prior treatment of hippocampal slices with either DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleate (10 microM) or ifenprodil (20 microM). However, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (1 microM) had no effect on the action of conantokin-T.

While most use a harpoon for prey capture, the Gastridium clade that includes the well-studied Conus geographus and Conus tulipa, have developed a net hunting strategy to catch fish. This unique feeding behaviour requires secretion of \"nirvana cabal\" peptides to dampen the escape response of targeted fish allowing for their capture directly by mouth. However, the active components of the nirvana cabal remain poorly defined. In this study, we evaluated the behavioural effects of likely nirvana cabal peptides on the teleost model, Danio rerio (zebrafish). Surprisingly, the conantokins (NMDA receptor antagonists) and/or conopressins (vasopressin receptor agonists and antagonists) found in C. geographus and C. tulipa venom failed to produce a nirvana cabal-like effect in zebrafish. In contrast, low concentrations of the non-competitive adrenoceptor antagonist \u03c1-TIA found in C. tulipa venom (EC<sub>50</sub> = 190 nM) dramatically reduced the escape response of zebrafish larvae when added directly to aquarium water. \u03c1-TIA inhibited the zebrafish \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor, confirming \u03c1-TIA has the potential to reverse the known stimulating effects of norepinephrine on fish behaviour. \u03c1-TIA may act alone and not as part of a cabal, since it did not synergise with conopressins and/or conantokins. This study highlights the importance of using ecologically relevant animal behaviour models to decipher the complex neurobiology underlying the prey capture and defensive strategies of cone snails.",

Here, we further characterize its pharmacological activity as well as its structure-activity relationships. In the isolated rat vas deferens, rho-TIA inhibited alpha1-adrenoreceptor-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that were triggered by norepinephrine, but did not affect presynaptic alpha2-adrenoreceptor-mediated responses. In radioligand binding assays using [125I]HEAT, rho-TIA displayed slightly greater potency at the alpha 1B than at the alpha 1A or alpha 1D subtypes. Moreover, although it did not affect the rate of association for [3H]prazosin binding to the alpha 1B-adrenoreceptor, the dissociation rate was increased, indicating non-competitive antagonism by rho-TIA. N-terminally truncated analogs of rho-TIA were less active than the full-length peptide, with a large decline in activity observed upon removal of the fourth residue of rho-TIA (Arg4). An alanine walk of rho-TIA confirmed the importance of Arg4 for activity and revealed a number of other residues clustered around Arg4 that contribute to the potency of rho-TIA. The unique allosteric antagonism of rho-TIA resulting from its interaction with receptor residues that constitute a binding site that is distinct from that of the classical competitive alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonists may allow the development of inhibitors that are highly subtype selective.",

In this study, we examined the antinociceptive and motor effects of cone snail venom-derived peptides, conantokins G and T (conG and conT), which are selective inhibitors of the NR2B or NR2A and NR2B subtypes of the NMDA receptor, respectively. We tested the effects of conG and conT in models of tissue (formalin test), nerve injury (partial sciatic nerve ligation) and inflammation-induced (intraplantar Complete Freund's Adjuvant; CFA) pain in mice. In the formalin test, intrathecal (i.t.) conG or conT suppressed the ongoing pain behavior (ED(50) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), 11 (7-19) and 19 (11-33), respectively) at doses that were 17-27 times lower than those required to impair motor function (accelerating rotarod treadmill test: ED(50) and 95% CI, 300 (120-730) and 320 (190-540) pmol, respectively). By comparison, SNX-111, an N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel antagonist that is also derived from cone snail venom, produced significant motor impairment at a dose (3.0 pmol, i.t.) that was only partially efficacious in the formalin test. Furthermore, conG reversed the allodynia produced by nerve injury, with greater potency on thermal (ED50 and 95% CI, 24 (10-55) pmol) than on mechanical allodynia (59 (33-105) pmol). Finally, a single dose of conG (100 pmol, i.t.) also reduced CFA-evoked thermal and mechanical allodynia. Taken together, these results demonstrate that conantokins exhibit potent antinociceptive effects in several models of injury-induced pain. The study supports the notion that drugs directed against subtypes of the NMDA receptor, by virtue of their reduced side-effect profile, hold promise as novel therapeutic agents for the control of pain.",

We recently reported a method for direct detection of viral RNA from a highly pathogenic human H5 influenza strain (A/Hanoi/30408/2005(H5N1)), which necessarily was transcribed in vitro from non-viral sources. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the reaction conditions for in vitro transcription (IVT) of full-length influenza H5 RNA, which is needed for diagnostic RNA production, for the T7 and SP6 phage promoter systems. Gel analysis of RNA transcribed from plasmids containing the H5 sequence between a 5' SP6 promoter and 3' restriction site (BsmBI) showed that three sequence-verified bands at 1,776, 784, and 591 bases were consistently produced, whereas only one 1,776-base band was expected. These fragments were not observed in H1 or H3 influenza RNA transcribed under similar conditions. A reverse complement of the sequence produced only a single band at 1,776 bases, which suggested either self-cleavage or early termination. Aliquots of the IVT reaction were quenched with EDTA to track the generation of the bands over time, which maintained a constant concentration ratio. The H5 sequence was cloned with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase promoters to allow transcription in either direction with either polymerase. The T7 transcription product from purified, restricted plasmids in the vRNA direction only produced the 1,776-base full-length sequence and the 784-base fragment, instead of the three bands generated by the SP6 system, suggesting an early termination mechanism. Additionally, the T7 system produced a higher fraction of full-length vRNA transcripts than the SP6 system did under similar reaction conditions. By sequencing we identified a type II RNA hairpin loop terminator, which forms in a transcription direction-dependent fashion. Variation of the magnesium concentration produced the greatest impact on termination profiles, where some reaction mixtures were unable to produce full-length transcripts. Optimized conditions are presented for the T7 and SP6 phage polymerase systems to minimize these early termination events during in vitro transcription of H5 influenza vRNA.",

More recently, another unusual mechanism has been described, that of termination-dependent re-initiation (also known as stop-start). Here, the AUG start codon of a 3' ORF (open reading frame) is proximal to the termination codon of a uORF (upstream ORF), and expression of the two ORFs is coupled. For example, segment 7 mRNA of influenza B is bicistronic, and the stop codon of the M1 ORF and the start codon of the BM2 ORF overlap in the pentanucleotide UAAUG (stop codon of M1 is shown in boldface and start codon of BM2 is underlined). This short review aims to provide some insights into how this translational coupling process is regulated within different viral systems and to highlight some of the differences in the mechanism of re-initiation on prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral mRNAs.",

A comparison of inhibition kinetics was made with 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate and phosphonoformate. Inhibition of the reverse transcriptase was evaluated using poly(rA).oligo(dT)12-18, poly(rC).oligo(dG)12-18, or influenza virion RNA template with a specific oligodeoxynucleotide as primer. (-)-Carbovir 5'-triphosphate was shown to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an apparent Ki similar to that of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate. Chain elongation studies utilizing an MS2 RNA template showed that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate terminated transcription at positions identical to those where dideoxy-GTP terminated. This indicates that (-)-carbovir 5'-monophosphate is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA and terminates transcription at that point. We conclude that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme and that (-)-carbovir most likely inhibits HIV by activity at the triphosphate level by a combination of direct competition for binding of the natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the reverse transcriptase and chain termination.",

For example, the segment 7 RNA of influenza B is dicistronic, and the stop codon of the M1 ORF and the start codon of the BM2 ORF overlap in the pentanucleotide UAAUG (the stop codon of M1 is shown in bold and the start codon of BM2 is underlined). Recent evidence has highlighted the potential importance of mRNA-rRNA interactions in reinitiation on caliciviral and influenza B viral RNAs, probably used to tether 40S ribosomal subunits to the RNA after termination in time for initiation factors to be recruited to the AUG of the downstream ORF.

Using cell biological, biochemical, and genetic tools, we reveal that influenza A virus (IAV) infection induces global transcriptional defects at the 3' ends of active host genes and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) run-through into extragenic regions. Deregulated RNAPII leads to expression of aberrant RNAs (3' extensions and host-gene fusions) that ultimately cause global transcriptional downregulation of physiological transcripts, an effect influencing antiviral response and virulence. This phenomenon occurs with multiple strains of IAV, is dependent on influenza NS1 protein, and can be modulated by SUMOylation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of NS1 expressed by the 1918 pandemic IAV strain. Our data identify a strategy used by IAV to suppress host gene expression and indicate that polymorphisms in IDRs of viral proteins can affect the outcome of an infection.",

In this manner, transcription of NS RNA from the recombinant initiates and terminates using SV40 control sequences. RNA mapping and sequence analysis showed that the RNA transcripts are processed to produce both the spliced and unspliced NS mRNAs in approximately equal abundance. The junction sequence of the spliced mRNA is identical to that of NS2 mRNA found in influenza virus-infected cells. In addition, another mRNA species was found to contain a chimera splice between SV40 and NS sequences. Both NS1 and NS2 polypeptides are produced in the recombinant-infected cells as predicted from sequence analysis.

We show that influenza virus executes a two-pronged attack on host transcription. First, viral infection causes decreased Pol II gene occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. Second, virus-induced cellular stress leads to a catastrophic failure of Pol II termination at poly(A) sites, with transcription often continuing for tens of kilobases. Defective Pol II termination occurs independently of the ability of the viral NS1 protein to interfere with host mRNA processing. Instead, this termination defect is a common effect of diverse cellular stresses and underlies the production of previously reported downstream-of-gene transcripts (DoGs).

It enables relative quantification of proteins from multiple biological samples in a single MS run with high efficiency and high throughput. However, experiments often require more biological replicates or conditions than can be accommodated by a single run, and involve multiple TMT mixtures and multiple runs. Such larger-scale experiments combine sources of biological and technical variation in patterns that are complex, unique to TMT-based workflows, and challenging for the downstream statistical analysis. These patterns cannot be adequately characterized by statistical methods designed for other technologies, such as label-free proteomics or transcriptomics. This manuscript proposes a general statistical approach for relative protein quantification in MS- based experiments with TMT labeling. It is applicable to experiments with multiple conditions, multiple biological replicate runs and multiple technical replicate runs, and unbalanced designs. It is based on a flexible family of linear mixed-effects models that handle complex patterns of technical artifacts and missing values. The approach is implemented in <i>MSstatsTMT</i>, a freely available open-source R/Bioconductor package compatible with data processing tools such as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS, and SpectroMine.

The primary outcome was assessed for 2307 (99%) participants. The primary outcome, functional status at day 90, did not differ significantly between the groups (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0\u00b788, 95% CI 0\u00b776-1\u00b703, p=0\u00b711). Although there were fewer deaths by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (101 [9%] deaths in the tranexamic acid group vs 123 [11%] deaths in the placebo group; aOR 0\u00b773, 0\u00b753-0\u00b799, p=0\u00b70406), there was no difference in case fatality at 90 days (250 [22%] vs 249 [21%]; adjusted hazard ratio 0\u00b792, 95% CI 0\u00b777-1\u00b710, p=0\u00b737). Fewer patients had serious adverse events after tranexamic acid than after placebo by days 2 (379 [33%] patients vs 417 [36%] patients), 7 (456 [39%] vs 497 [43%]), and 90 (521 [45%] vs 556 [48%]). Functional status 90 days after intracerebral haemorrhage did not differ significantly between patients who received tranexamic acid and those who received placebo, despite a reduction in early deaths and serious adverse events.

Tranexamic acid had been an effective haemostatic agent in reducing post-operative and traumatic bleeding. We review current evidence examining the efficacy of tranexamic acid in improving clinical outcome after ICH. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and clinical trial registers for studies using search strategies incorporating the terms 'intracerebral haemorrhage', 'tranexamic acid' and 'antifibrinolytic'. Authors of ongoing clinical trials were contacted for further details. We screened 268 publications and retrieved 17 articles after screening. Unpublished information from three ongoing clinical trials was obtained. We found five completed studies. Of these, two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous tranexamic acid to placebo (<i>n</i> = 54) reported no significant difference in death or dependency. Three observational studies (<i>n</i> = 281) suggested less haematoma growth with rapid tranexamic acid infusion. There are six ongoing RCTs (<i>n</i> = 3089) with different clinical exclusions, imaging selection criteria (spot sign and haematoma volume), time window for recruitment and dosing of tranexamic acid. Despite their heterogeneity, the ongoing trials will provide key evidence on the effects of tranexamic acid on ICH. There are uncertainties of whether patients with negative spot sign, large haematoma, intraventricular haemorrhage, or poor Glasgow Coma Scale should be recruited. The time window for optimal effect of haemostatic therapy in ICH is yet to be established. Tranexamic acid is a promising haemostatic agent for ICH. We await the results of the trials before definite conclusions can be drawn.",

As a center of these receptor responses, TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK1) activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). SRC is a member of Src family kinases (SFK) which participates in TBK1-mediated IFN I signaling pathway. In mammals, the immunological function of SRC is depended on its interaction with TBK1. To date, SRC has not been studied in fish. In this paper, we cloned the ORF of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) SRC (CiSRC). CiSRC has a closer relationship with Sinocyclocheilus rhinocerous SRC (SrSRC). The expression level of CiSRC was significantly up-regulated following poly (I:C) stimulation in grass carp tissues and cells. Subcellular localization results showed that CiSRC is located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, while CiTBK1 is only located in the cytoplasm of CIK cells. When GFP-CiSRC and FLAG-CiTBK1 were co-transfected into CIK cells, we found that they were co-localized in the cytoplasm. GST-pulldown and Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that CiSRC and CiSRC tyrosine kinase domain deletion mutant (SRC-\u0394Tyrkc) can interact with CiTBK1, respectively. CiSRC promotes the phosphorylation of CiTBK1. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of TBK1 is more strongly under poly (I:C) stimulation. We also demonstrated that SRC can up-regulate IFN I expression. These results above unraveled that CiSRC initiates innate immune response by binding to and then up-regulating the phosphorylation of TBK1.",

Research on more species of fish is necessary to clarify whether the function of fish TBK1 is conserved compared to that in mammals. Here, a cyprinid fish (Ancherythroculter nigrocauda) TBK1 (AnTBK1) was functionally identified and characterized. The full-length open reading frame (ORF) of AnTBK1 consists of 2184 nucleotides encoding 727 amino acids and contains a conserved Serine/Threonine protein kinase catalytic domain (S_TKc) in the N-terminal, similar to TBK1 in other species. The transcripts of AnTBK1 were found in all the tissues evaluated and the cellular distribution indicated that AnTBK1 was localized in the cytoplasm. In terms of functional identification, AnTBK1 induced a variety of IFN promoter activities as well as the expression of downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In addition, AnTBK1 interacted with and significantly phosphorylated IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), exhibiting the canonical kinase activity of TBK1. Finally, AnTBK1 presented strong antiviral activity against spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection. Taken together, our research on the features and functions of AnTBK1 demonstrated that AnTBK1 plays a central role in IFN induction against SVCV infection.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31711273": "The innate immune system, in particular the type I interferon (IFN) response, is a powerful defence against virus infections. In turn, many if not all viruses have evolved various means to circumvent, resist, or counteract this host response to ensure efficient replication and propagation. Influenza viruses are no exception to this rule, and several viral proteins have been described to possess IFN-antagonistic functions. Although the viral nonstructural protein 1 appears to be a major antagonist in influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV), we have previously shown that a specific motif in the IAV polymerase proteins exerts an IFN-suppressive function very early in infection. The question remained whether a similar function would also exist in IBV polymerases. Here, we show that indeed a specific amino acid position (A523) of the PB1 protein in the IBV polymerase complex confers IFN-antagonistic properties. Mutation of this position leads to enhanced activation of the IFN-mediated signalling pathway after infection and subsequent reduction of virus titres. This indicates that inhibition of innate immune responses is a conserved activity shared by polymerase proteins of IAV and IBV.",

In this study, the Mx gene was isolated from the constructed mullet cDNA database. Structural features of mullet Mx (MuMx) were analyzed using different in-silico tools. The pairwise comparison revealed that the MuMx sequence was related to Stegastes partitus Mx with an 83.7% sequence identity, whereas MuMx was clustered into the teleost category in the phylogentic analysis. Sequence alignment showed that the dynamin-type guanine nucleotide-binding domain (G_DYNAMIN_2), central interactive domain (CID), and GTPase effector domain (GED) were conserved among Mx counterparts. The transcriptional expression of MuMx was the highest in blood cells from unchallenged fish. The temporal mRNA profile showed that MuMx expression was significantly elevated in all tissues, including blood, spleen, head kidney, liver, and gills after the injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) at many time points. Moreover, MuMx expression increased slightly, in the blood, spleen, and head kidney at a few time points after the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Lactococcus garvieae (L. garvieae). Results of the subcellular localization analysis confirmed that the MuMx protein was highly expressed in the cytoplasm. The analysis of the gene expression of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) under conditions of MuMx overexpression confirmed the significant inhibition of viral transcripts. The cell viability (MTT) assay and VHSV titer quantification with the presence of MuMx indicated a significant reduction in virus replication. Collectively, these findings suggest that Mx is a specific immune-related gene that elicits crucial antiviral functions against viral antigens in the mullet fish.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038844": "The development of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are associated with chronic inflammation. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway, leading to increased inflammatory cytokine expression, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Interventions to reduce each of these factors have been demonstrated to reduce the development of CVD. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring compound that demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects in humans and various animal and cell culture models. The effects of MSM include decreased NF-\u03baB activation, decreased expression of TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6. However, the effects of MSM within the heart have not yet been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether MSM protects cardiac cells from inflammation that occurs in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. A novel immortalized human ventricular cardiomyocyte cell line, designated Ac16, developed and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Mercy Davidson, Columbia Invention Report No. 823, U.S. patent No. 7,223,599 were utilized. Cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1, alone or in combination with MSM. To confirm an appropriate dosage of MSM, the effect of various concentrations on cell viability, and IL-6 production were examined. The effect of MSM on transcript expression of pro-inflammatory markers and activation of NF-\u03baB were examined with the established dose by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. MSM treatment combined with TNF-\u03b1 significantly decreased IL-6 production and transcript expression compared to TNF-\u03b1 alone. These findings indicate that MSM may protect against inflammation in the heart, and thereby protect against inflammation-linked CVDs. Further study is warranted to determine the effect of MSM on cardiovascular health outcomes.",

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a sulfur-based nutritional supplement that is purported to have pain and inflammation-reducing effects. To investigate the effects of MSM in attenuating damage associated with physical exertion, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of MSM supplementation on exercise-induced pain, oxidative stress and muscle damage. Twenty-two healthy females (<i>n</i> = 17) and males (<i>n</i> = 5) (age 33.7 \u00b1 6.9 yrs.) were recruited from the 2014 Portland Half-Marathon registrant pool. Participants were randomized to take either MSM (OptiMSM\u00ae) (<i>n</i> = 11), or a placebo (<i>n</i> = 11) at 3 g/day for 21 days prior to the race and for two days after (23 total). Participants provided blood samples for measurement of markers of oxidative stress, and completed VAS surveys for pain approximately one month prior to the race (T<sub>0</sub>), and at 15 min (T<sub>1</sub>), 90 min (T<sub>2</sub>), 1 Day (T<sub>3</sub>), and 2 days (T<sub>4</sub>) after race finish. The primary outcome measure 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) measured oxidative stress. Secondary outcomes included malondialdehyde (MDA) for oxidative stress, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as measures of muscle damage, and muscle (MP) and joint pain (JP) recorded using a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Data were analyzed using repeated and multivariate ANOVAs, and simple contrasts compared post-race time points to baseline, presented as mean (SD) or mean change (95% CI) where appropriate. Running a half-marathon induced significant increases in all outcome measures (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). From baseline, 8-OHdG increased significantly at T<sub>1</sub> by 1.53 ng/mL (0.86-2.20 ng/mL CI, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and T<sub>2</sub> by 1.19 ng/mL (0.37-2.01 ng/mL CI, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and fell below baseline levels at T<sub>3</sub> by -0.46 ng/mL (-1.18-0.26 CI, <i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) and T<sub>4</sub> by -0.57 ng/mL (-1.27-0.13 CI, <i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). MDA increased significantly at T<sub>1</sub> by 7.3 \u03bcM (3.9-10.7 CI, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Muscle damage markers CK and LDH saw significant increases from baseline at all time-points (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Muscle and joint pain increased significantly from baseline at T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and returned to baseline levels at T<sub>4</sub>. Time-by-treatment results did not reach statistical significance for any outcome measure, however, the MSM group saw clinically significant (\u0394 &gt; 10 mm) reductions in both muscle and joint pain. Participation in a half-marathon was associated with increased markers of oxidative stress, muscle damage, and pain. MSM supplementation was not associated with a decrease from pre-training levels of oxidative stress or muscle damage associated with an acute bout of exercise. MSM supplementation attenuated post-exercise muscle and joint pain at clinically, but not statistically significant levels.",

Inflammation is associated with strenuous exercise and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. <i>Methods</i>. Physically active men were supplemented with either placebo or MSM (3 grams per day) for 28 days before performing 100 repetitions of eccentric knee extension exercise. <i>Ex vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> testing consisted of evaluating cytokine production in blood (whole blood and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), before and through 72 hours after exercise, while <i>in vivo</i> testing included the evaluation of cytokines before and through 72 hours after exercise. <i>Results</i>. LPS stimulation of whole blood after MSM supplementation resulted in decreased induction of IL-1<i>\u03b2</i>, with no effect on IL-6, TNF-<i>\u03b1</i>, or IL-8. After exercise, there was a reduced response to LPS in the placebo, but MSM resulted in robust release of IL-6 and TNF-<i>\u03b1</i>. A small decrease in resting levels of proinflammatory cytokines was noted with MSM, while an acute postexercise increase in IL-10 was observed with MSM. <i>Conclusion</i>. Strenuous exercise causes a robust inflammatory reaction that precludes the cells from efficiently responding to additional stimuli. MSM appears to dampen the release of inflammatory molecules in response to exercise, resulting in a less incendiary environment, allowing cells to still have the capacity to mount an appropriate response to an additional stimulus after exercise.",

This study evaluated the effect and usefulness of MSM in combinatory therapy with known drug doxorubicin (DOX). The effect of combinational treatment of MSM and DOX on the induction of apoptosis was evaluated in EC cell lines (ISHIKAWA, MFE-296, MFE-280). We observed that MSM itself induces apoptosis in EC cell lines, and pre-treatment with MSM for 24 h increases the sensitivity of EC cells to DOX-induced apoptosis and DNA damage and that effect might be regulated by p42/44 (Erk1/2) MAPK and Akt (protein kinase B).

The purpose was to identify a set of candidate protein and RNA biomarkers that are associated with improved outcomes related to inflammation and muscle injury, when athletes used 3 proprietary supplements both prior to and during early recovery from a half-marathon race. The study was an open-label pilot study. The study was field based, with sample analysis conducted in the Applied Physiology Laboratory in the Department of Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. Participants were 15 young, exercise-trained men and women. The intervention group consumed 1000 mg/d of a proprietary 50-50 mix of optimized curcumin and pomegranate extract for 26 days. The group also consumed 500 mg/d of a proprietary MSM for the same period. Three days prior to and one day after a race, the daily dosage was doubled. The control group received no supplements. Venous blood samples were collected at pre-race and at 4h and 24h after running a half-marathon race. The research team evaluated results for target proteins that have been associated with inflammation and muscle injury in the scientific literature. The team also performed an analysis of RNA biomarkers. At the 4h and 24h time points, a significant treatment-response was observed that included increases in proteins: (1) osteonectin/SPARC-osteonectin/secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine and (2) BDNF-brain-derived neurotrophic factor. At the same points, the study also found increased RNA: (1) PACER-P50-associated COX-2 extragenic RNA, (2) PTGES-prostaglandin E synthase, (3) MYD88-innate immune signal transduction adaptor MYD88, (4) TNFS14-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member 14, (5) THRIL-TNF and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL)-related immunoregulatory long noncoding RNA, (6) TRAF6-TNF receptor associated factor 6, (7) CX3CL1-C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1, (8) MALAT1-metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, and (9) LINC00305-long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 305.

Despite its popularity, there is little published toxicology data on MSM. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acute and subchronic toxicity of MSM in rats at a dose five to seven times the maximum recommended dose in humans. MSM administered in a single gavage dose of 2 g/kg resulted in no adverse events or mortality. MSM administered as a daily dose of 1.5 g/kg for 90 days by gavage resulted in no adverse events or mortality. Necropsy did not reveal any gross pathological lesions or changes in organ weights. Renal histology of treated animals was normal. It is concluded that MSM is well tolerated in rats at an acute dose of 2 g/kg and at a subacute chronic dose of 1.5 g/kg.",

Given that RANKL plays a critical role in osteoclast formation and bone resorption, any new compounds found to alter its activity would be predicted to have therapeutic potential for disorders associated with bone loss. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring sulfur compound with well-documented anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; currently its effects on osteoclast differentiation are unknown. We sought to investigate whether MSM could regulate osteoclastogenesis, and if so, its mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSM on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, together with STAT3's involvement in the expression of osteoclastic gene markers. These experiments were conducted using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) and cell line material, together with analyses that interrogated both protein and mRNA levels, as well as signaling pathway activity. Although MSM was not toxic to osteoclast precursors, MSM markedly inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP activity, multinucleated osteoclast formation, and bone resorptive activity. Additionally, the expression of several osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes, including TRAF6, c-Fos, NFATc1, cathepsin K, and OSCAR were suppressed by MSM. MSM mediated suppression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis involved inhibition of ITAM signaling effectors such as PLC\u03b3 and Syk, with a blockade of NF-kB rather than MAPK activity. Furthermore, MSM inhibited RANKL-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 Ser727. Knockdown of STAT3 using shRNAs resulted in reduced RANKL-mediated phosphorylation of Ser727 STAT3, and TRAF6 in cells for which depletion of STAT3 was confirmed. Additionally, the expression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenic marker genes were significantly decreased by MSM and STAT3 knockdown. Taken together, these results indicate that STAT3 plays a pivotal role in RANKL-induced osteoclast formation, and that MSM can attenuate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by blocking both NF-kB and STAT3 activity.",

The purpose of treatment of periodontal disease is to promote the regeneration of periodontal tissue, including alveolar bone, and implantation of fixtures to replace the missing tooth as a result of advanced periodontal disease also requires alveolar bone regeneration. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a sulfur compound with well-known anti-inflammatory effects but its effects on bone regeneration are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSM on osteogenic differentiation of human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that MSM not only promotes the proliferation but also promotes osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. MSM increased the expression levels of osteogenic specific markers that ALP, OPN, OCN, Runx2, and OSX. Smad2/3 signaling pathway was reinforced by MSM. Runx2, which downstream of Smad pathway, was expressed in accordance. Consistent with in vitro results, in vivo calvarial defect model and transplantation model revealed that MSM induces hPDLSCs to differentiate into osteoblast, which express ALP, OPN and OCN highly and enhance bone formation. These results suggest that MSM promotes osteogenic differentiation and bone formation of hPDLSCs, and Smad2/3 / Runx2 / OSX / OPN may play critical roles in the MSM-induced osteogenic differentiation. Thus, MSM combined with hPDLSCs may be a good candidate for future clinical applications in alveolar bone regeneration and can be used for graft material in reconstructive dentistry.",

Although MSM has been shown to have various physiological effects, no study has yet focused on inflammasome activation. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that serves as a platform for caspase 1-dependent proteolytic maturation and secretion of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). In this study, we tested the effect of MSM on inflammasome activation using mouse and human macrophages. In our results, MSM significantly attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages, although it had no effect on NLCR4 or AIM2 inflammasome activation. Extracts of MSM-enriched vegetables presented the same inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation as MSM. MSM also attenuated the transcriptional expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and NLRP3. Taken together, these results show that MSM has anti-inflammatory characteristics, interrupts NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and inhibits pro-cytokine expression. We further confirmed the intracellular mechanism of MSM in relation to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, followed by comparison with that of DMSO. Both chemicals showed a synergic effect on anti-NLRP3 activation and attenuated production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, MSM is a selective inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and can be developed as a supplement to control several metabolic disorders.",

MSM has protective effects against various disorders through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties however the effect of MSM on gastric mucosal injury remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to determine whether MSM has beneficial effects on ethanol/HCl-induced gastric ulcer in mice. Macroscopic and histopathological evaluation of gastric mucosa revealed that ethanol/HCl administration produced apparent mucosal injuries, while pretreatment with MSM (200 and 400mg/kg, orally) could effectively protect gastric mucosa against the injuries caused by acidified ethanol. MSM significantly increased the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), carbonyl protein, and nitric oxide (NO) in gastric tissues compared with those in the ethanol group. MSM suppressed gastric inflammation by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Moreover, pretreatment of mice with MSM decreased the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) as a key regulator of inflammation in gastric mucosa. Taken together, these data suggest that MSM is able to decrease the severity of ethanol/HCl-induced gastric mucosal injury through inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation.",

MSM significantly inhibited the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) by alleviating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were decreased by MSM treatment in cell culture supernatants. Further study indicated that the translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB to the nucleus was inhibited by MSM treatment in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, in which it helped block degradation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that topical administration of MSM at 500-1250 microg/ear resulted in similar inhibitory activities in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced mouse ear edema.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), the isoxidised form of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DSMO), is an effective natural analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral glucosamine (Glu), methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), their combination and placebo in osteoarthritis of the knee. A total of 118 patients of either sex with mild to moderate osteoarthritis were included in the study and randomised to receive either Glu 500mg, MSM 500mg, Glu and MSM or placebo capsules three times daily for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated at 0 (before drug administration), 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-treatment for efficacy and safety. The efficacy parameters studied were the pain index, the swelling index, visual analogue scale pain intensity, 15m walking time, the Lequesne index, and consumption of rescue medicine. Glu, MSM and their combination significantly improved signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis compared with placebo. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean (+/- SD) pain index from 1.74 +/- 0.47 at baseline to 0.65 +/- 0.71 at week 12 with Glu (p &lt; 0.001). MSM significantly decreased the mean pain index from 1.53 +/- 0.51 to 0.74 +/- 0.65, and combination treatment resulted in a more significant decrease in the mean pain index (1.7 +/- 0.47 to 0.36 +/- 0.33; p &lt; 0.001). After 12 weeks, the mean swelling index significantly decreased with Glu and MSM, while the decrease in swelling index with combination therapy was greater (1.43 +/- 0.63 to 0.14 +/- 0.35; p &lt; 0.05) after 12 weeks. The combination produced a statistically significant decrease in the Lequesne index. All treatments were well tolerated. Glu, MSM and their combination produced an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in osteoarthritis. Combination therapy showed better efficacy in reducing pain and swelling and in improving the functional ability of joints than the individual agents. All the treatments were well tolerated. The onset of analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity was found to be more rapid with the combination than with Glu.

Eight, healthy men (27.1 \u00b1 6.9 yrs old) who were considered to be moderately exercise-trained (exercising &lt;150 minutes per week) were randomly assigned to ingest MSM at either 1.5 grams per day or 3.0 grams per day for 30 days (28 days before and 2 days following exercise). Before and after the 28 day intervention period, subjects performed 18 sets of knee extension exercise in an attempt to induce muscle damage (and to be used partly as a measure of exercise performance). Sets 1-15 were performed at a predetermined weight for 10 repetitions each, while sets 16-18 were performed to muscular failure. Muscle soreness (using a 5-point Likert scale), fatigue (using the fatigue-inertia subset of the Profile of Mood States), blood antioxidant status (glutathione and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity [TEAC]), and blood homocysteine were measured before and after exercise, pre and post intervention. Exercise performance (total work performed during sets 16-18 of knee extension testing) was also measured pre and post intervention. Muscle soreness increased following exercise and a trend was noted for a reduction in muscle soreness with 3.0 grams versus 1.5 grams of MSM (p = 0.080), with a 1.0 point difference between dosages. Fatigue was slightly reduced with MSM (p = 0.073 with 3.0 grams; p = 0.087 for both dosages combined). TEAC increased significantly following exercise with 3.0 grams of MSM (p = 0.035), while homocysteine decreased following exercise for both dosages combined (p = 0.007). No significant effects were noted for glutathione or total work performed during knee extension testing (p &gt; 0.05). MSM, especially when provided at 3.0 grams per day, may favorably influence selected markers of exercise recovery. More work is needed to extend these findings, in particular using a larger sample of subjects and the inclusion of additional markers of exercise recovery and performance.",

Yet, it remains unclear whether these changes in nuclear structure are mediated by Xist and whether they are required for silencing. Here, we show that Xist directly interacts with the Lamin B receptor, an integral component of the nuclear lamina, and that this interaction is required for Xist-mediated silencing by recruiting the inactive X to the nuclear lamina and by doing so enables Xist to spread to actively transcribed genes across the X. Our results demonstrate that lamina recruitment changes the 3D structure of DNA, enabling Xist and its silencing proteins to spread across the X to silence transcription.",

To evaluate structural changes associated with allelic silencing, we have applied a recently developed Hi-C assay that uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation to mouse F1 hybrid systems. We find radically different conformations for the two female mouse X chromosomes. The inactive X has two superdomains of frequent intrachromosomal contacts separated by a boundary region. Comparison with the recently reported two-superdomain structure of the human inactive X shows that the genomic content of the superdomains differs between species, but part of the boundary region is conserved and located near the Dxz4/DXZ4 locus. In mouse, the boundary region also contains a minisatellite, Ds-TR, and both Dxz4 and Ds-TR appear to be anchored to the nucleolus. Genes that escape X inactivation do not cluster but are located near the periphery of the 3D structure, as are regions enriched in CTCF or RNA polymerase. Fewer short-range intrachromosomal contacts are detected for the inactive alleles of genes subject to X inactivation compared with the active alleles and with genes that escape X inactivation. This pattern is also evident for imprinted genes, in which more chromatin contacts are detected for the expressed allele. By applying a novel Hi-C method to map allelic chromatin contacts, we discover a specific bipartite organization of the mouse inactive X chromosome that probably plays an important role in maintenance of gene silencing.",

So far, only relatively simple geometric features, like distances and angles between different genomic regions, have been evaluated. This work is concerned with more complex geometric properties, i.e., the complete shape formed by genomic regions. Our work is based on statistical shape theory and we use different approaches to analyze the considered structures, e.g., shape uniformity test, 3D point-based registration, Fisher distribution, and 3D non-rigid image registration for shape normalization. We have applied these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by multicolor FISH. We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random. In addition, we found that the shapes of active and inactive X-chromosomal genomic regions are statistically independent. Moreover, we reconstructed the average 3D structure of chromatin in a small genomic region (below 4 Mb) based on five BACs resulting from two overlapping four BAC regions. We found that geometric normalization with respect to the nucleus shape based on non-rigid image registration has a significant influence on the location of the genomic regions.",

Dxz4 orientation controls the distribution of contacts on the Xi, as shown by a massive reversal in long-range contacts after Dxz4 inversion. Despite an increase in CTCF binding and chromatin accessibility on the Xi in Dxz4-edited cells, only minor changes in TAD structure and gene expression were detected, in accordance with multiple epigenetic mechanisms ensuring X silencing. We propose that Dxz4 represents a structural platform for frequent long-range contacts with multiple loci in a direction dictated by the orientation of its bank of CTCF motifs, which may work as a ratchet to form the distinctive bipartite structure of the condensed Xi.",

A cost-effectiveness analysis, using a decision model, was performed with a hypothetical cohort of prenatal subjects. Parameter estimates, costs and ranges for sensitivity analyses were ascertained from the literature and expert opinion. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed an incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of $10 433 (Canadian dollars) for genotyping compared to no genotyping per adverse event averted. Results were sensitive to hospital admission costs. The ICER was lower when evaluating only subjects having caesarean deliveries or those from ethnic populations known to have a high prevalence of ultra-rapid metabolizers. Although genotyping to guide pharmacotherapy was not cost saving, the cost to avert an infant adverse event may represent good value for money in specific populations.

Because of their molecular defect, current treatment options have limited success in bringing HoFH patient to LDL-C target and morbidity and mortality remain high. We review current and upcoming therapies directed at HoFH, including gene therapy. Recent real-world studies have confirmed the strength in lomitapide as a treatment adjunct to statins and other lipid-lowering therapies in HoFH patients. The approval of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor monoclonal antibodies has also been a welcome addition to the treatment armamentarium offering an additional average reduction in LDL-C levels of 24% when added to background lipid-lowering therapies in this population. Although achieving adequate LDL-C levels in this population is difficult, there are several therapies on the horizon that may help more patients reach goal. Evinacumab, a monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL3, has been shown to substantially reduce LDL-C of an average of 49%, independently of residual LDLR activity. RNA interference targeting PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 shows promise in clinical trials. Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer and gene editing techniques are in early clinical and preclinical development. LDL-C lowering in HoFH patients remains very challenging. However, novel treatment options are emerging. Upcoming therapies directed at PCSK9 and ANPTL3 may offer additional LDL-C reduction, to help patients achieve adequate LDL-C levels.

The availability of risk scores and genetic tests should facilitate its opportune detection and management. Nutritional therapy is based on a very-low-fat diet with adequate supply of lipid-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids, plus avoidance of alcohol consumption. Current pharmacological treatment may include fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids but prioritizes biotechnological agents targeting the molecular disturbances of the disease.

Subjects with LDL-C \u22652.6 and &lt;4.1 mmol/L were enrolled to one of four dose cohorts: evinacumab subcutaneous (SC) 300 mg single dose, SC 300 mg once weekly for eight doses, intravenous (IV) 5 mg/kg, or IV 15 mg/kg once every 4 weeks for two doses. Each cohort comprised 24 subjects (12 Japanese; 12 Caucasian), randomized (3:1) to receive evinacumab or placebo within each ethnic group with a 24-week follow-up. The safety profile of evinacumab (IV and SC) in both ethnicities was comparable with placebo, with no serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events. Pharmacokinetic profiles were comparable between Japanese and Caucasian subjects across IV and SC groups. Mean calculated LDL-C decreased from baseline with both IV doses, beginning on day 3 up to week 8. Triglyceride changes observed with evinacumab IV were rapid (seen by day 2) and sustained up to week 8. Evinacumab SC doses also reduced LDL-C and triglyceride levels, although lower doses induced smaller changes. Evinacumab (IV and SC) reduced other lipids, including apolipoprotein B, versus placebo. In both ethnicities, evinacumab (IV and SC) was generally well tolerated, exhibiting comparable pharmacokinetic profiles. Dose-related reductions in LDL-C and triglycerides were observed with evinacumab in both ethnic groups.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30011918": "Genetic and clinical studies have demonstrated that loss-of-function variants in the angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) gene are associated with decreased plasma levels of triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), which leads to a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk. For this reason, ANGPTL3 is considered an important new pharmacological target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) together with more conventional lipid lowering therapies, such as statins and anti proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies. Experimental evidence demonstrates that anti-ANGPTL3 therapies have an important anti-atherosclerotic effect. Results from phase I clinical trials with a monoclonal anti-ANGPTL3 antibody (evinacumab) and anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) clearly show a significant lipid lowering effect. In addition, from the analysis of the protein structure of ANGPTL3, it has been hypothesized that, beyond its inhibitory activity on lipoprotein and endothelial lipases, this molecule may have a pro-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic effect and a negative effect on cholesterol efflux, implying additional pro-atherosclerotic properties. In the future, data from phase II clinical trials and additional experimental evidence will help to define the efficacy and the additional anti-atherosclerotic properties of anti-ANGPTL3 therapies beyond the already available lipid lowering therapies.",

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels and an extremely high risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A phase 2, proof-of-concept study (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02265952\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02265952</a>) demonstrated that evinacumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3 protein), reduced LDL-C levels in 9 patients with genotypically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and was well tolerated. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of evinacumab on LDLR activity in lymphocytes purified from patients in the proof-of-concept study. Approach and Results: LDLR activity was assessed in patient lymphocytes before and after treatment with evinacumab and versus lymphocytes carrying wild-type LDLR, and also in an LDLR-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-<i>ldl</i>A7) transfected with plasmids encoding the LDLR variants. Overall mean peak reduction in LDL-C with evinacumab was -58\u00b118%, occurring between Week 4 and Week 12. Mutations identified in the 9 patients were shown to be pathogenic, with loss of LDLR activity versus wild type. Two of the LDLR variants, p.(Cys681*) and p.(Ala627Profs*38), were class 2 type mutations that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Six variants were class 3 type mutations with impaired LDL-C binding activity: p.(Trp87Gly), occurring in 2 patients, p.(Gln254Pro), p.(Ser177Leu), p.(Gly335Val), and p.(Ser306Leu). Evinacumab had no effect on LDLR activity. These results suggest that evinacumab is effective for lowering LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and the inhibition of ANGPTL3 in humans lowers LDL-C in a mechanism independent of the LDLR.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403015": "Although elevated serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is without any doubts accepted as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the role of elevated triglycerides (TGs)-rich lipoproteins as an independent risk factor has until recently been quite controversial. Recent data strongly suggest that elevated TG-rich lipoproteins are an independent risk factor for CVD and that therapeutic targeting of them could possibly provide further benefit in reducing CVD morbidity, events and mortality, apart from LDL-C lowering. Today elevated TGs are treated with lifestyle interventions, and with fibrates which could be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. There are also some new drugs. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and it seems that it can substantially lower elevated TGs levels because ANGPTL3 also regulates TGs metabolism. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator which also decreases TGs, and improves other lipid parameters. It seems that it also has some other possible antiatherogenic effects. Alipogene tiparvovec is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral vector that delivers copies of the LPL gene to muscle tissue which accelerates the clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins thus decreasing extremely high TGs levels. Pradigastat is a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor which substantially reduces extremely high TGs levels and appears to be promising in treatment of the rare familial chylomicronemia syndrome.",

Lipid-lowering therapy is a cornerstone of the CV risk modification strategy. The first line treatment for hyperlipidemia is statins, which decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30-50% and proportionally reduce the CV events. However, they are not always enough to achieve LDL-C goals in many patients, and some patients are statin intolerant. For this reason, new powerful injectable lipid-lowering drugs have been developed. The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the more recent clinical data on safety and tolerability of injectable lipid-lowering drugs.

Results from 2 Phase 1 studies in hypertriglyceridemic subjects are reported here. Subjects with triglycerides &gt;150 but \u2264450 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u2265100 mg/dL (n=83 for single ascending dose study [SAD]; n=56 for multiple ascending dose study [MAD]) were randomized 3:1 to evinacumab:placebo. SAD subjects received evinacumab subcutaneously at 75/150/250 mg, or intravenously at 5/10/20 mg/kg, monitored up to day 126. MAD subjects received evinacumab subcutaneously at 150/300/450 mg once weekly, 300/450 mg every 2 weeks, or intravenously at 20 mg/kg once every 4 weeks up to day 56 with 6 months of follow-up. The primary outcomes were incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. Efficacy analyses included changes in triglycerides and other lipids over time. In the SAD, 32 (51.6%) versus 9 (42.9%) subjects on evinacumab versus placebo reported treatment-emergent adverse events. In the MAD, 21 (67.7%) versus 9 (75.0%) subjects on subcutaneously evinacumab versus placebo and 6 (85.7%) versus 1 (50.0%) on intravenously evinacumab versus placebo reported treatment-emergent adverse events. No serious treatment-emergent adverse events or events leading to death or treatment discontinuation were reported. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (7 [11.3%] SAD), aspartate aminotransferase (4 [6.5%] SAD), and creatinine phosphokinase (2 [3.2%) SAD, 1 [14.3%] MAD) were observed with evinacumab (none in the placebo groups), which were single elevations and were not dose-related. Dose-dependent reductions in triglycerides were observed in both studies, with maximum reduction of 76.9% at day 3 with 10 mg/kg intravenously (P&lt;0.0001) in the SAD and of 83.1% at day 2 with 20 mg/kg intravenously once every 4 weeks (P=0.0003) in the MAD. Significant reductions in other lipids were observed with most evinacumab doses versus placebo. Evinacumab was well-tolerated in 2 Phase 1 studies. Lipid changes in hypertriglyceridemic subjects were similar to those observed with ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations.

Despite treatment with traditional lipid-lowering therapies (LLT), most patients with familial hypercholesterolemia are unable to achieve target LDL-C. We review current and future novel therapeutic options available for familial hypercholesterolemia. The use of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are effective in lowering LDL-C in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, with a reduction in LDL-C of 60% in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and up to 35% in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Inclisiran, another novel agent, is a small-interfering ribonucleic acid that reduces hepatic production of PCSK9 to provide a prolonged and sustained reduction in LDL-C of nearly 50% in HeFH. However, both agents require LDL receptor (LDLR) activity. Evinacumab, a novel monoclonal antibody against angiopoetin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), reduces LDL-C by 50% independent of LDLR activity.

As the population ages, the number of patients diagnosed with advanced heart failure and listed for transplant steadily increases annually. However, there remains a paucity of eligible donation after brain death (DBD) donor hearts which severely limits access to cardiac transplantation and leads to increasing wait-list times and avoidable patient mortalities. Though the first human heart transplant in 1967 was performed using a deceased donor heart, the advent of brain death criteria and the ability to avoid long warm ischemic times led donation after cardiac death (DCD) transplantation to fall out of favor. Due the current state of cardiac transplantation, there has been a resurgence in interest in DCD heart transplantation leading to the development of DCD heart transplantation programs in the UK and Australia after positive reports of successful DCD cardiac transplantation in the pediatric literature. These programs have demonstrated favorable post-transplantation outcomes equivalent to matched traditional DBD transplants with current techniques and strict donor criteria. This technique has been proven safe with favorable outcomes and has been demonstrated to significantly increase transplant volumes and decrease patient mortality.

Following this triumph, the ensuing decade saw a waning interest in heart transplantation given the complications related to rejection and immunosuppression. With the introduction of cyclosporine immunotherapy in the early 1980s, however, success was more the rule than the exception, and cardiac transplantation became an acceptable therapy. Currently, heart transplantation is considered the gold standard therapy for end-stage heart failure refractory to medical treatment. One-year survival is now approximately 85%, and 10-year survival approaches 60%. While the main obstacles in the early years of heart transplantation were immunosuppression, the current issue at hand is organ availability. Approximately 2500 heart transplants are done yearly, but the list of candidates exceeds 50,000. What is perhaps even more alarming is the fact that while the number of heart transplants performed in the United States has dropped every year since 1994, the prevalence of heart failure increases every year and is predicted to do so into the year 2030. Nevertheless, the last 20 years has seen dramatic improvements in the ways we diagnose rejection, the fine-tuning of immunosuppressive regimens, and the advent of better preservation techniques. We have a better understanding of the causes of acute and chronic rejection and ways to treat these problems. Undoubtedly, we will continue to fine-tune the therapy in the years to come.

Despite remarkable progress in the clinical management of rejection, rejection continues to limit survival and quality of life in the heart transplant population. This review will discuss the biologic processes involved in hyperacute rejection, acute rejection, and humoral (vascular) rejection. The development of endomyocardial biopsy techniques represented a significant advancement in the diagnosis of cardiac rejection, and endomyocardial biopsy remains the 'gold standard' in the diagnosis of cellular rejection. To date, no noninvasive parameters will diagnose rejection with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Biopsy frequency and immunosuppressive therapies may be tailored to the risk of rejection. Immunosuppression for cardiac transplantation can be divided into three major phases: 1) perioperative immunosuppression; 2) maintenance immunosuppression, and; 3) treatment of rejection. The strategy for treating transplant rejection should be influenced by several variables: 1) Histologic grade of rejection; 2) Evidence of hemodynamic compromise by ejection fraction or right heart catheterization; 3) Severity of previous rejection episodes and types of immunosuppressives used; and 4) Risk factors for rejection, including time after transplantation. Future rejection therapy will involve more sophisticated attempts to alter host responses toward the donor organ in a more specific and selective way. Despite considerable advances in the care of the heart transplant recipient, long-term survival is limited by cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

Since then this life-saving procedure has been performed in over 120 000 patients. A limitation to the performance of this procedure is the availability of donor hearts with as many as 20% of patients dying before a donor's heart is available for transplant. Today, hearts for transplantation are procured from individuals experiencing donation after brain death (DBD). Interestingly, this, however, was not always the case as the first heart transplants occurred after circulatory death. Revisiting the availability of hearts for transplant from those experiencing donation after circulatory death (DCD) could further expand the number of hearts suitable for transplantation. There are several considerations pertinent to transplanting hearts from those undergoing circulatory death. In this review, we summarize the main distinctions between DBD and DCD heart donation and discuss the research relevant to increasing the number of hearts available for transplantation by including individual's hearts that experience circulatory death.",

Between 1967 and 1973, 10 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Four lived for more than 1 year. The longest survivor died after 12 1/2 years, and one patient remains alive and fully employed 11 1/2 years after transplantation. Since 1974, 44 patients have undergone heterotopic heart transplantation, whereby the donor heart is inserted in parallel with the recipient's own heart. Four of these patients have undergone retransplantation for acute or chronic rejection. Survival has been almost 60% for 1 year, falling to 21% by 5 years. The major complications of heart transplantation have been early acute and late chronic rejection; immunosuppression has been complicated by a high incidence of infection, particularly during the first year, and by a 10% incidence of the development of malignant tumors. A portable hypothermic perfusion system has been developed to store and transport donor hearts for periods of up to 24 hours.",

Following surgical training in South Africa and the USA, Barnard established a successful open-heart surgery programme at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town in 1958. In 1967, he led the team that performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant. The article describing this remarkable achievement was published in the South African Medical Journal just three weeks after the event and is one of the most cited articles in the cardiovascular field. In the lay media as well, this first transplant remains the most publicised event in world medical history. Although the first heart transplant patient survived only 18 days, four of Groote Schuur Hospital's first 10 patients survived for more than one year, two living for 13 and 23 years, respectively. This relative success amid many failures worldwide did much to generate guarded optimism that heart transplantation would eventually become a viable therapeutic option. This first heart transplant and subsequent ongoing research in cardiac transplantation at the University of Cape Town and in a few other dedicated centres over the subsequent 15 years laid the foundation for heart transplantation to become a well-established form of therapy for end-stage cardiac disease. During this period from 1968 to 1983, Chris Barnard and his team continued to make major contributions to organ transplantation, notably the development of the heterotopic ( 'piggy-back') heart transplants; advancing the concept of brain death, organ donation and other related ethical issues; better preservation and protection of the donor heart (including hypothermic perfusion storage of the heart; studies on the haemodynamic and metabolic effects of brain death; and even early attempts at xenotransplantation.",

From the repair of the first septal defect in 1953, followed by the first successful heart transplant in 1967, and later to the first infusion of bone marrow-derived cells to the human myocardium in 2002, significant progress has been made in heart repair. However, chronic heart failure remains a leading pathological burden worldwide. Why has regenerating the human heart been such a challenge, and how close are we to achieving clinically relevant regeneration? Exciting progress has been made to establish cell transplantation techniques in recent years, and new preclinical studies in large animal models have shed light on the promises and challenges that lie ahead. In this review, we will discuss the history of cell therapy approaches and provide an overview of clinical trials using cell transplantation for heart regeneration. Focusing on the delivery of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, current experimental strategies in the field will be discussed as well as their clinical translation potential. Although the human heart has not been regenerated yet, decades of experimental progress have guided us onto a promising path. Previous work in clinical cell therapy for heart repair using bone marrow mononuclear cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and cardiac-derived cells have overall demonstrated safety and modest efficacy. Recent advancements using human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have established them as a next generation cell type for moving forward, however certain challenges must be overcome for this technique to be successful in the clinics.",

On December 3, 1967, in Cape Town, South Africa, Dr. Christian Barnard revolutionized organ transplantation with the first successful human heart transplant. With it came the dawning of a new era--life for one preserved through the death of another. But with this advancement came great demands. Patients waited, hoping sometimes in vain, that a kidney transplant would end their long hours of suffering on dialysis, or that a heart transplant would prolong their otherwise shortened existence. Expectations grew, but the supply of organs did not. It became clear that the full and continued benefit of such medical advances depended on an increased supply of human organs for transplantation. This article focuses on the issues surrounding the procurement of human organs for transplantation. A brief history of transplantation and the benefits of transplantation are presented, as well as the present means of supplying organs for transplantation and how this supply could be enhanced by alternate procurement methods.",

We developed a protein score for the response to TNFi treatment in RA and investigated its predictive value. In RA patients eligible for biological treatment included in the BiOCURA registry, 53 inflammatory proteins were measured using xMAP\u00ae technology. A supervised cluster analysis method, partial least squares (PLS), was used to select the best combination of proteins. Using logistic regression, a predictive model containing readily available clinical parameters was developed and the potential of this model with and without the protein score to predict European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response was assessed using the area under the receiving operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) and the net reclassification index (NRI). For the development step (n = 65 patient), PLS revealed 12 important proteins: CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein, MIP1a), CCL17 (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine), CCL19 (MIP3b), CCL22 (macrophage-derived chemokine), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14), sCD74 (macrophage migration inhibitory factor), soluble IL-1 receptor I, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor II. The protein score scarcely improved the AUC-ROC (0.72 to 0.77) and the ability to improve classification and reclassification (NRI = 0.05). In validation (n = 185), the model including protein score did not improve the AUC-ROC (0.71 to 0.67) or the reclassification (NRI = -0.11). No proteomic predictors were identified that were more suitable than clinical parameters in distinguishing TNFi non-responders from responders before the start of treatment.

RNA sequencing was performed on mRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected before initiation of treatment. The expression of pathways as well as individual gene transcripts between responders and nonresponders was investigated. Promising targets were technically replicated and validated in n = 40 new patients using qPCR assays. Before therapy initiation, nonresponders had lower expression of pathways related to interferon and cytokine signaling, while also showing higher levels of two genes, GPR15 and SEMA6B (p = 0.02). The two targets could be validated, however, additional analyses revealed that GPR15 and SEMA6B did not independently predict response, but were rather dose-dependent markers of smoking (p &lt; 0.0001).

The aim of the study was to explore the use of a metabolomics to identify predictors for the outcome of TNFi therapy, and study the metabolomic fingerprint in active RA irrespective of patients' response. In the metabolomic profiling, lipids, oxylipins, and amines were measured in serum samples of RA patients from the observational BiOCURA cohort, before start of biological treatment. Multivariable logistic regression models were established to identify predictors for good- and non-response in patients receiving TNFi (n = 124). The added value of metabolites over prediction using clinical parameters only was determined by comparing the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive value and by the net reclassification index (NRI). The models were further validated by 10-fold cross validation and tested on the complete TNFi treatment cohort including moderate responders. Additionally, metabolites were identified that cross-sectionally associated with the RA disease activity score based on a 28-joint count (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). Out of 139 metabolites, the best-performing predictors were sn1-LPC(18:3-\u03c93/\u03c96), sn1-LPC(15:0), ethanolamine, and lysine. The model that combined the selected metabolites with clinical parameters showed a significant larger AUC-ROC than that of the model containing only clinical parameters (p = 0.01). The combined model was able to discriminate good- and non-responders with good accuracy and to reclassify non-responders with an improvement of 30% (total NRI = 0.23) and showed a prediction error of 0.27. For the complete TNFi cohort, the NRI was 0.22. In addition, 88 metabolites were associated with DAS28, ESR or CRP (p&lt;0.05).

This study aims to discover miRNAs that predict response and aims to replicate results of two previous studies addressing this topic. From the observational BiOCURA cohort, 40 adalimumab- (ADA) and 40 etanercept- (ETN) treated patients were selected to enter the discovery cohort and baseline serum profiling on 758 miRNAs was performed. The added value of univariately selected miRNAs (p &lt; 0.05) over clinical parameters in prediction of response was determined by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Validation was performed by TaqMan single qPCR assays in 40 new patients. Expression of miR-99a and miR-143 predicted response to ADA, and miR-23a and miR-197 predicted response to ETN. The addition of miRNAs increased the AUC-ROC of a model containing only clinical parameters for ADA (0.75 to 0.97) and ETN (0.68 to 0.78). In validation, none of the selected miRNAs significantly predicted response. miR-23a was the only overlapping miRNA compared to the two previous studies, however inversely related with response in one of these studies. The reasons for the inability to replicate previously proposed miRNAs predicting response to TNFi and replicate those from the discovery cohort were investigated and discussed. To date, no miRNA consistently predicting response to TNFi therapy in RA has been identified. Future studies on this topic should meet a minimum of standards in design that are addressed in this study, in order to increase the reproducibility.",

Prediction thereof would be clinically relevant and guide the decision whether to start TNFi treatment. Data were used from the observational BiOCURA cohort, in which patients initiating biological treatment were enrolled and followed up for one year. In the model development cohort (n=192), a model predicting TNFi discontinuation was built using Cox-regression with backward selection (p&lt;0.05). The parameters of the model were tested again in a model refinement cohort (n=60), for significance (p&lt;0.05) and consistency of effect. In addition, we performed a systematic review to put our study results into perspective. Of the 252 patients who initiated TNFi treatment, 103 (41%) had to discontinue treatment. Discontinuation was predicted at baseline by female gender, current smoking, high visual analogue scale of general health, and higher number of previously used biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). At refinement, smoking status and number of previously used bDMARDs remained with re-estimated hazard ratios (HRs) in the total cohort of 1.74 (95%-CI 1.15-2.63, p&lt;0.01) and 1.40 (95%-CI 1.1-1.68, p&lt;0.01), respectively. Using these two predictors, we developed a simple score predicting discontinuation (PPV=72.3%). From literature, predictors were pack years of smoking, number of previously used bDMARDs, lack of any concomitant DMARD therapy and in particular lack of concomitant methotrexate (MTX). TNFi discontinuation is predicted by current smoking and number of previously used bDMARDs, as well as by pack years of smoking and lack of any concomitant DMARD/MTX therapy.",

The identification of cancers with a significant adenosine drive is critical to understand the potential for these molecules. However, it is challenging to measure tumor adenosine levels at scale, thus novel, clinically tractable biomarkers are needed. We generated a gene expression signature for the adenosine signaling using regulatory networks derived from the literature and validated this in patients. We applied the signature to large cohorts of disease from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients. The signature captures baseline adenosine levels <i>in vivo</i> (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.92, <i>P</i> = 0.018), is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in mice (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = -0.62, <i>P</i> = 0.001) and humans (reduction in 5 of 7 patients, 70%), and is abrogated after A2AR knockout. Analysis of TCGA confirms a negative association between adenosine and overall survival (OS, HR = 0.6, <i>P</i> &lt; 2.2e<sup>-16</sup>) as well as progression-free survival (PFS, HR = 0.77, <i>P</i> = 0.0000006). Further, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced OS (HR = 0.47, <i>P</i> &lt; 2.2e<sup>-16</sup>) and PFS (HR = 0.65, <i>P</i> = 0.0000002) in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-infiltrated tumors. Mutation of TGF\u03b2 superfamily members is associated with enhanced adenosine signaling and worse OS (HR = 0.43, <i>P</i> &lt; 2.2e<sup>-16</sup>). Finally, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts (HR = 0.29, <i>P</i> = 0.00012).

Its level rises up to 1000-fold in response to acute inflammation. High sensitivity CRP level is utilized as an independent biomarker of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. The accumulating data suggests that CRP has two distinct forms. It is predominantly produced in the liver in a native pentameric form (nCRP). At sites of local inflammation and tissue injury it may bind to phosphocholine-rich membranes of activated and apoptotic cells and their microparticles, undergoing irreversible dissociation to five monomeric subunits, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). Through dissociation, CRP deposits into tissues and acquires distinct proinflammatory properties. It activates both classic and alternative complement pathways, binding complement component C1q and factor H. mCRP actively participates in the development of endothelial dysfunction. It activates leukocytes, inducing cytokine release and monocyte recruitment. It may also play a role in the polarization of monocytes and T cells into proinflammatory phenotypes. It may be involved in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) opsonization and uptake by macrophages. mCRP deposits were detected in samples of atherosclerotic lesions from human aorta, carotid, coronary and femoral arteries. mCRP may also induce platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, thus contributing in multiple ways in the development of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. In this mini-review, we will provide an insight into the process of conformational rearrangement of nCRP, leading to dissociation, and describe known effects of mCRP. We will provide a rationalization for mCRP involvement in the development of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis.",

Using global transcriptome analysis of liver tissue from donors with pathologically elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), we observed comparable extent of positive and negative acute phase response, where the top upregulated gene sets included immune response and defense pathways while downregulation occurred mostly in metabolic and catabolic pathways including many important drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNA), which usually act as negative regulators of gene expression, contribute to this process. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses identified differentially expressed miRNAs in liver tissues from donors with elevated CRP, cholestasis, steatosis, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Using luciferase reporter constructs harboring native and mutated 3'-untranslated gene regions, several predicted miRNA binding sites on RXR\u03b1 (miR-130b-3p), CYP2C8 (miR-452-5p), CYP2C9 (miR-155-5p), CYP2C19 (miR-155-5p, miR-6807-5p), and CYP3A4 (miR-224-5p) were validated.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11534818": "The nuclei of human neutrophils typically consist of a linear array of three or four lobes joined by DNA-containing filaments. Terminal lobes are connected to internal lobes via a single filament, while internal lobes have two filaments, each to an adjacent lobe. Some lobes also have appendages of various shapes and sizes. In particular, up to 17% of neutrophil nuclei of healthy women exhibit a drumstick-shaped appendage that contains the inactive X chromosome. This report provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between nuclear morphology and the location of the X and Y chromosomes in human neutrophils. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the X and the Y chromosomes of male neutrophil nuclei are randomly distributed among nuclear lobes. Similarly, in female neutrophil nuclei with a drumstick appendage, the active X chromosome is also randomly distributed among lobes. In contrast, the inactive X chromosome is preferentially located in a terminal lobe in over 90% nuclei with drumsticks. Within the terminal lobe of nuclei with drumsticks, the inactive X chromosome lies distal to the point of filament attachment in 80% of the nuclei. The inactive X chromosome also exhibits a specific orientation within the drumstick appendage, with over 95% of nuclei having the X centromere located toward the tip of the appendage. Female nuclei without a drumstick appendage also have one of the X chromosomes (presumably the inactive chromosome) preferentially situated in a terminal lobe. Nonrandom distribution of the inactive X chromosome is discussed in the context of a model that considers chromosomes as determinants of neutrophil nuclear morphology.",

Bone marrow smears of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia untreated as well as treated with \"specific\" anti-leukaemic therapy with imatinib mesylate are a convenient model for such study because they possess a satisfactory number of cells for diameter and optical density measurements. In addition, the identification of developmental stages of granulocytes is very easy and the morphology is not different from that in not-leukaemic persons. As it was expected, the mean diameter of nuclear segments in fully differentiated and mature granulocytes was much smaller than that in non-segmented nuclei of early granulocytic precursors. Therefore, no wonder that the heterochromatin condensation state in nuclear segments of mature granulocytes was much larger than in non-segmented nuclei of granulocytic progenitors. On the other hand, the sum of mean diameters of all nuclear segments per cell was close to the mean nuclear diameter of early granulocytic progenitors. The heterochromatin condensation state in granulocytic progenitors or fully differentiated mature granulocytes exhibited marked stability and did not change after the anti-leukaemic therapy. In addition, Barr bodies of characteristic drumstick appearance bearing inactive X chromosome in interphase nuclei of mature granulocytes in fertile female patients exhibited a heterochromatin condensation state similar to nuclear segments.

Tpl2(-/-) macrophages have abrogated TNF production but overproduce IL-12 in response to TLR ligands. Despite enhanced IL-12 production, Tpl2(-/-) T cells have impaired IFN-gamma production. Therefore, the role of Tpl2 in a bona fide bacterial infection where all of these cytokines are important in host defense is unclear. To address this issue, we infected Tpl2(-/-) mice with the model pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We found that Tpl2(-/-) mice infected i.v. with L. monocytogenes had increased pathogen burdens compared with wild-type mice and rapidly succumbed to infection. Enhanced susceptibility correlated with impaired signaling through TLR2 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2, two receptors previously shown to mediate Listeria recognition. Surprisingly, TNF production in response to infection was not significantly impaired, even though Tpl2 has been implicated in the regulation of TNF. We found that the role of Tpl2 has cell-type specific effects in regulating TNF and transduces signals from some, but not all, pattern recognition receptors (PRR). In contrast to the cell-type- and receptor-specific regulation of TNF, we found that Tpl2 is essential for IL-1beta production from both macrophages and dendritic cells. These studies implicate Tpl2 as an important mediator for collaboration of pattern recognition receptors with danger-associated molecular patterns to induce TNF and IL-1beta production and optimal host defense.",

Here, we report the first study of Cot/tpl2 involvement in acute peripheral inflammation in vivo. Six hours after an intraplantar injection of zymosan, Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice showed a 47% reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, concomitant with a 46% lower neutrophil recruitment and a 40% decreased luminol-mediated bioluminescence imaging in vivo. Accordingly, Cot/tpl2 deficiency provoked a 25-30% reduction in luminol-mediated bioluminescence and neutrophil recruitment together with a 65% lower macrophage recruitment 4 h following zymosan-induced peritonitis. Significantly impaired levels of G-CSF and GM-CSF and of other cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, as well as some chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine, were detected during the acute zymosan-induced intraplantar inflammatory response in Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice. Moreover, Cot/tpl2 deficiency dramatically decreased the production of the hypernociceptive ligand NGF at the inflammatory site during the course of inflammation. Most importantly, Cot/tpl2 deficiency significantly reduced zymosan-induced inflammatory hypernociception in mice, with a most pronounced effect of a 50% decrease compared with wild type (WT) at 24 h following intraplantar injection of zymosan. At this time, Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced NGF, TNF\u03b1, and prostaglandin E(2) levels compared with WT littermates. In conclusion, our study demonstrates an important role of Cot/tpl2 in the NGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF production and myeloperoxidase activity in the acute inflammatory response process and its implication in inflammatory hypernociception.",

To do so, DCs have to traverse many different tissues with varying oxygen tensions. Additionally, DCs are often exposed to low oxygen tensions in tumors, where vascularization is lacking, as well as in inflammatory foci, where oxygen is rapidly consumed by inflammatory cells during the respiratory burst. DCs respond to oxygen levels to tailor immune responses to such low-oxygen environments. In the present study, we identified a mechanism of hypoxia-mediated potentiation of release of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), a pro-inflammatory cytokine with important roles in both anti-cancer immunity and autoimmune disease. We show in human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that this potentiation is controlled exclusively via the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We identified MAPK kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8) as a target gene of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF), a transcription factor controlled by oxygen tension, upstream of the p38/MAPK pathway. Hypoxia increased expression of MAP3K8 concomitant with the potentiation of TNF-\u03b1 secretion. This potentiation was no longer observed upon siRNA silencing of MAP3K8 or with a small molecule inhibitor of this kinase, and this also decreased p38/MAPK phosphorylation. However, expression of DC maturation markers CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR were not changed by hypoxia. Since DCs play an important role in controlling T-cell activation and differentiation, our results provide novel insight in understanding T-cell responses in inflammation, cancer, autoimmune disease and other diseases where hypoxia is involved.",

IL-22 has also been shown to modulate cell cycle and proliferation mediators such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of IL-22 in tumorigenesis. In this paper, we propose that IL-22 has a crucial role to play in controlling epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in the breast. IL-22 increased MAP3K8 phosphorylation through IL-22R1, followed by the induction of MEK-ERK, JNK-c-Jun, and STAT3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, IL-22-IL-22R1 signaling pathway activated activator protein-1 and HER2 promoter activity. In addition, Pin1 was identified as a key positive regulator for the phosphorylation-dependent MEK, c-Jun and STAT3 activity induced by IL-22. Pin1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) exhibited significantly a decrease in IL-22-induced MEK1/2, c-Jun, and STAT3 phosphorylation compared with Pin1(+/+) MEF. In addition, a knockdown of Pin1 prevented phosphorylation induced by IL-22. The in vivo chorioallantoic membrane assay also showed that IL-22 increased tumor formation of JB6 Cl41 cells. Moreover, the knockdown of MAP3K8 and Pin1 attenuated tumorigenicity of MCF7 cells. Consistent with these observations, IL-22 levels positively correlate with MAP3K8 and Pin1 expression in human breast cancer. Overall, our findings point to a critical role for the IL-22-induced MAP3K8 signaling pathway in promoting cancer-associated inflammation in the tumor microenvironment.",

MAP3K8 (TPL2/COT) is an important signal transductor and activator of pro-inflammatory pathways that has been linked to obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation. We used human adipose tissue biopsies to study the relationship of MAP3K8 expression with markers of obesity and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8). Moreover, we evaluated obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in mice lacking MAP3K8 and WT mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Individuals with a BMI &gt;30 displayed a higher mRNA expression of MAP3K8 in adipose tissue compared to individuals with a normal BMI. Additionally, high mRNA expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8, but not TNF -\u03b1, in human adipose tissue were associated with higher expression of MAP3K8. Moreover, high plasma SAA and CRP did not associate with increased MAP3K8 expression in adipose tissue. Similarly, no association was found for MAP3K8 expression with plasma insulin or glucose levels. Mice lacking MAP3K8 had similar bodyweight gain as WT mice, yet displayed lower mRNA expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and CXCL1 in adipose tissue in response to the HFD as compared to WT animals. However, MAP3K8 deficient mice were not protected against HFD-induced adipose tissue macrophage infiltration or the development of insulin resistance. Together, the data in both human and mouse show that MAP3K8 is involved in local adipose tissue inflammation, specifically for IL-1\u03b2 and its responsive cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, but does not seem to have systemic effects on insulin resistance.",

Kinase activities were inhibited with pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA. Lipolysis was monitored through glycerol production. Gene expression in adipocytes and adipose tissue of obese mice and subjects was measured by real-time PCR. IkappaB kinase-(IKK)-beta inhibition prevented mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK1/2 activation in response to interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha but not insulin in 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes, suggesting that IKKbeta regulated a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) involved in ERK1/2 activation induced by inflammatory cytokines. We show that the MAP3K8 called Tpl2 was expressed in adipocytes and that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha activated Tpl2 and regulated its expression through an IKKbeta pathway. Pharmacological inhibition or silencing of Tpl2 prevented MEK/ERK1/2 activation by these cytokines but not by insulin, demonstrating its involvement in ERK1/2 activation specifically in response to inflammatory stimuli. Importantly, Tpl2 was implicated in cytokine-induced lipolysis and in insulin receptor substrate-1 serine phosphorylation. Tpl2 mRNA expression was upregulated in adipose tissue of obese mice and patients and correlated with TNF-alpha expression. Tpl2 is selectively involved in inflammatory cytokine-induced ERK1/2 activation in adipocytes and is implicated in their deleterious effects on adipocyte functions.

We previously demonstrated that Tpl2 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and modulates T helper cell differentiation. However, very little is known about how Tpl2 modulates the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs are a specialized subset of T cells that express FoxP3 and possess immunosuppressive properties to limit excess inflammation. Because of the documented role of Tpl2 in promoting inflammation, we hypothesized that Tpl2 antagonizes Treg development and immunosuppressive function. Here we demonstrate that Tpl2 constrains the development of inducible Tregs. Tpl2(-/-) na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells preferentially develop into FoxP3(+) inducible Tregs in vitro as well as in vivo in a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced systemic tolerance. Treg biasing of Tpl2(-/-) T cells depended on TCR signal strength and corresponded with reduced activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Importantly, Tpl2(-/-) Tregs have basally increased expression of FoxP3 and immunosuppressive molecules, IL-10 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Furthermore, they were more immunosuppressive in vivo in a T cell transfer model of colitis, as evidenced by reduced effector T cell accumulation, systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, and colonic inflammation. These results demonstrate that Tpl2 promotes inflammation in part by constraining FoxP3 expression and Treg immunosuppressive functions. Overall, these findings suggest that Tpl2 inhibition could be used to preferentially drive Treg induction and thereby limit inflammation in a variety of autoimmune diseases.",

However, intracellular signaling mechanisms of the AR-mediated proinflammatory responses of microglia are not fully understood. Using a rapid and stable in vitro reporter assay system to evaluate IL-1\u03b2 production in microglial BV2 cells, we found that NA and the \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol upregulated the IL-1\u03b2 reporter activity. This effect was suppressed by \u03b2-AR antagonists. We further examined the involvement of EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) and TPL2 (tumor progression locus 2, MAP3K8) and found that inhibitors for EPAC and TPL2 reduced AR agonist-induced IL-1\u03b2 reporter activity. These inhibitors also suppressed NA-induced endogenous Il1b mRNA expression and IL-1\u03b2 protein production. Our results suggest that EPAC and TPL2 are involved in \u03b2-AR-mediated IL-1\u03b2 production in microglial cells, and extend our understanding of its intracellular signaling mechanism.",

Furthermore, functional consequences for the IBD-risk locus rs1042058 in <i>TPL2</i> are unknown. We analysed protein, cytokine and RNA expression, and signalling in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) through western blot, ELISA, real-time PCR and flow cytometry. PRR-induced cytokine secretion was increased in MDMs from rs1042058 <i>TPL2</i> GG risk individuals. TPL2 activation by the Crohn's disease-associated PRR nucleotide-oligomerisation domain (NOD)2 required PKC, and IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b3 signalling. TPL2, in turn, significantly enhanced NOD2-induced ERK, JNK and NF\u03baB signalling. We found that another major mechanism for the TPL2 contribution to NOD2 signalling was through ERK-dependent and JNK-dependent caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation, which in turn, led to early autocrine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion and amplification of long-term cytokines. Importantly, <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>-induced cytokines from human intestinal myeloid-derived cells required TPL2 as well as autocrine IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Finally, rs1042058 GG risk carrier MDMs from healthy individuals and patients with Crohn's disease had increased TPL2 expression and NOD2-initiated TPL2 phosphorylation, ERK, JNK and NF\u03baB activation, and early autocrine IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion.

Perspective. Review of the literature and authors' experience. Many publications demonstrate IGF-1R overexpression in TED, and its activation as an autoantigen as a critical factor in TED pathogenesis. Several in vitro studies demonstrate that IGF-1R inhibition attenuates downstream molecular events including cytokine and hyaluronan production, and cellular differentiation.

Both the phase 2 and the recent phase 3 study results demonstrate that more patients with active TED receiving teprotumumab experienced a meaningful improvement in proptosis. Current TED treatment strategies target inflammation and symptoms, but do not modify the disease course.

Blocking IGF-1R attenuates TSH/M22-induced TNF\u03b1 production. This further delineates the interaction of TSHR and IGF1-R signaling pathways.

It is disfiguring and potentially blinding, culminating in orbital tissue remodeling and disruption of function of structures adjacent to the eye. There are currently no medical therapies proven capable of altering the clinical outcome of TAO in randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trials. The orbital fibroblast represents the central target for immune reactivity. Recent identification of fibroblasts that putatively originate in the bone marrow as monocyte progenitors provides a plausible explanation for why antigens, the expressions of which were once considered restricted to the thyroid, are detected in the TAO orbit. These cells, known as fibrocytes, express relatively high levels of functional TSH receptor (TSHR) through which they can be activated by TSH and the GD-specific pathogenic antibodies that underpin thyroid overactivity. Fibrocytes also express insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) with which TSHR forms a physical and functional signaling complex. Notably, inhibition of IGF-IR activity results in the attenuation of signaling initiated at either receptor. Some studies suggest that IGF-IR-activating antibodies are generated in GD, whereas others refute this concept. These observations served as the rationale for implementing a recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a monoclonal inhibitory antibody targeting IGF-IR in TAO. Results of that trial in active, moderate to severe disease revealed dramatic and rapid reductions in disease activity and severity. The targeting of IGF-IR with specific biologic agents may represent a paradigm shift in the therapy of TAO.",

Treatment with rapamycin/sirolimus has been reported to improve ocular motility and disease manifestations in TED. Whether this resulted from a primary antifibrotic effect on fibroblasts or was secondary to immune-suppression is unclear. In vitro contractility studies of primary orbital fibroblasts. Cells from patients with TED and controls were treated with rapamycin [mechanistic target of rapamycin an (mTOR) inhibitor] and MHY1485 (an mTOR stimulator) as well as inhibitors upstream in the same signaling cascade (saracatinib and befatinib). At concentrations consistent with the therapeutic dosing range in humans, rapamycin/sirolimus significantly reduces fibrosis in orbital fibroblasts from TED patients and controls in vitro. This effect is separate from, and in addition to, its immune suppressive effect. mTOR-driven fibrotic activity is greater in TED-derived fibroblasts and can be blocked also upstream of mTOR by inhibition of src. There was no adverse effect on cell survival. The authors present evidence for a direct antifibrotic effect of rapamycin/sirolimus in primary orbital fibroblasts. Targeting mTOR signaling presents a further and adjunctive treatment of TED alongside other immune-suppressive agents. By acting downstream of IGF1-R, sirolimus may offer a cost-effective alternative to teprotumumab therapy. Clinical case reports, now supplemented by this in vitro evidence, support the initiation of a clinical trial to treat the fibrotic sequelae of TED with this already-approved agent. Such an \"off-the-shelf\" therapy is a welcome prospect for TED treatment, particularly one available at a low price.",

Immunosuppressive therapy alternative to corticosteroids may target the different antigens involved in pathogenic mechanisms of GO. Some have already been employed in clinical studies and showed interesting results, although the lack of randomized and controlled trials suggests caution for their use in clinical practice. Potential targets for therapy in GO are the TSH receptor and the IGF-1 receptor on the fibroblasts, inflammatory cytokines, B and T cells. Most promising results are obtained by interacting with the PIK3/mTORC1 signaling cascades for adipogenesis and the anti-IGF-1R with the monoclonal antibody teprotumumab. A recent open study has shown that tocilizumab, an anti-sIL-6R antibody, inactivates GO. Consistent reports on the efficacy of rituximab have recently been challenged by randomized controlled trials. Clinical practice will greatly benefit from the use of disease modifying agents in GO, as compared to steroids, currently standard treatment for GO. Among these, rituximab may be useful, especially in patients resistant to steroid or with contraindications to steroids. However, larger randomized controlled trials are needed for definitive data on the potential disease-modifying role of rituximab in GO.

In TAO, the orbit can become inflamed and undergo substantial remodeling that is disfiguring and can lead to loss of vision. There are currently no approved medical therapies for TAO, the consequence of its uncertain pathogenic nature. It usually presents as a component of the syndrome known as Graves' disease where loss of immune tolerance to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) results in the generation of activating antibodies against that protein and hyperthyroidism. The role for TSHR and these antibodies in the development of TAO is considerably less well established. We have reported over the past 2 decades evidence that the insulin-like growth factorI receptor (IGF1R) may also participate in the pathogenesis of TAO. Activating antibodies against IGF1R have been detected in patients with GD. The actions of these antibodies initiate signaling in orbital fibroblasts from patients with the disease. Further, we have identified a functional and physical interaction between TSHR and IGF1R. Importantly, it appears that signaling initiated from either receptor can be attenuated by inhibiting the activity of IGF1R. These findings underpin the rationale for therapeutically targeting IGF1R in active TAO. A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug.

Patients with fibroproliferative ARDS have been shown to have increased IGF-1 and IGF-1R staining in lung tissue specimens. Rising levels of IGF-1 in bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) and increased IGF-1 mRNA expression in lung tissues (but declining serum IGF-1 levels) have been found in late stage ARDS compared with early lung injury. Blockage of IGF-1R decreases lung tissue damage and increases survival in bleomycin-induced as well as H1N1 influenza-related lung injury in animal models.

We conducted a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of teprotumumab, a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of IGF-IR, in patients with active, moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy. A total of 88 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or active drug administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for a total of eight infusions. The primary end point was the response in the study eye. This response was defined as a reduction of 2 points or more in the Clinical Activity Score (scores range from 0 to 7, with a score of \u22653 indicating active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy) and a reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis at week 24. Secondary end points, measured as continuous variables, included proptosis, the Clinical Activity Score, and results on the Graves' ophthalmopathy-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Adverse events were assessed. In the intention-to-treat population, 29 of 42 patients who received teprotumumab (69%), as compared with 9 of 45 patients who received placebo (20%), had a response at week 24 (P&lt;0.001).

It can result in orbital disfigurement, double vision, and visual loss. Consequently, it has a substantial negative effect on quality of life, mental health, and socioeconomic status. Most signs and symptoms of thyroid eye disease (TED) can be explained by the expansion of the orbital contents. Steroids are the mainstay of treatment in TED. However, recurrence may occur once steroids are withdrawn. Furthermore, in most cases, normal orbital anatomy is not restored, and skilled rehabilitative surgery is required to reduce disfigurement, double vision, and to preserve vision. Therefore, novel, causal, and more efficacious treatment strategies are warranted. In the last decade, the pathophysiology of TED has also been revised with the identification of new potential therapeutic targets. Recent clinical trials have shown that considerable benefit may be derived from the addition of antiproliferative agents (e.g., mycophenolate sodium) in preventing deterioration after steroid cessation. In addition, targeted biologic therapies have shown promise, including teprotumumab (anti-IGFR) which appears to substantially reduce proptosis, rituximab (anti-CD20) which reduces inflammation and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) which potentially benefits both of these parameters.

The members of one family of antiviral proteins, <i>apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3</i> (APOBEC3; shortened here to A3), act by deaminating cytidines to uridines during the reverse transcription reaction of HIV-1. The <i>A3</i> locus encodes seven genes, named <i>A3A</i> to <i>A3H</i> These genes have either one or two cytidine deaminase domains, and several of these A3s potently restrict HIV-1. A3C, which has only a single cytidine deaminase domain, however, inhibits HIV-1 only very weakly. We tested novel double domain protein combinations by genetically linking two <i>A3C</i> genes to make a synthetic tandem domain protein. This protein created a \"super restriction factor\" that had more potent antiviral activity than the native A3C protein, which correlated with increased packaging into virions. Furthermore, disabling one of the active sites of the synthetic tandem domain protein resulted in an even greater increase in the antiviral activity-recapitulating a similar evolution seen in A3F and A3G (double domain A3s that use only a single catalytically active deaminase domain). These A3C tandem domain proteins do not have an increase in mutational activity but instead inhibit formation of reverse transcription products, which correlates with their ability to form large higher-order complexes in cells. Finally, the A3C-A3C super restriction factor largely escaped antagonism by the HIV-1 viral protein Vif.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> As a part of the innate immune system, humans encode proteins that inhibit viruses such as HIV-1. These broadly acting antiviral proteins do not protect humans from viral infections because viruses encode proteins that antagonize the host antiviral proteins to evade the innate immune system. One such example of a host antiviral protein is APOBEC3C (A3C), which weakly inhibits HIV-1. Here, we show that we can improve the antiviral activity of A3C by duplicating the DNA sequence to create a synthetic tandem domain and, furthermore, that the proteins thus generated are relatively resistant to the viral antagonist Vif. Together, these data give insights about how nature has evolved a defense against viral pathogens such as HIV.",

The present study aimed to investigate the underlying functions of CagA in human gastric cancer, and to explore the associations between CagA, PTEN and Tet1 in gastric cancer. For that purpose, CagA overexpression and Tet1 interference recombinant lentiviral plasmids were constructed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was utilized to screen gene expression in HGC\u201127 human gastric cancer cells overexpressing CagA. qPCR and western blotting were used to detect gene and protein expression, respectively. In addition, the methylation status of PTEN was detected by methylation\u2011specific PCR. The expression levels of PTEN, Tet1, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit (APOBEC)3A, APOBEC3C and APOBEC3F were significantly decreased in the CagA overexpression group compared with in the negative control group in HGC\u201127 cells. Compared with in the negative control group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of PTEN were markedly decreased in cells with Tet1 interference. The decreased expression of PTEN was associated with increased methylation levels in the cells. In addition, the protein expression levels of PTEN were significantly decreased in HGC\u201127 cells when CagA was overexpressed. The expression levels of PTEN and Tet1 were also markedly decreased in CagA+ gastric cancer tissues compared with in non\u2011cancerous tissues. The decreased expression of PTEN in CagA+ gastric cancer tissues was associated with increased methylation levels. In conclusion, overexpression of CagA significantly decreased the expression of PTEN, Tet1, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C and APOBEC3F in human gastric cancer. In addition, CagA increased DNA methylation and decreased PTEN expression, which was reversed by Tet1 overexpression.

In this study, we demonstrate that sfRNA production by Zika virus represses XRN1 analogous to what we have previously shown for other flaviviruses. Using protein-RNA reconstitution and a stringent RNA pulldown assay with human choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells, we demonstrate that the sfRNAs from both dengue type 2 and Zika viruses interact with a common set of 21 RNA-binding proteins that contribute to the regulation of post-transcriptional processes in the cell, including splicing, RNA stability, and translation. We found that four of these sfRNA-interacting host proteins, DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) and enhancer of mRNA decapping 3 (EDC3) (two RNA decay factors), phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (a regulator of the biogenesis of the splicing machinery), and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3C (APOBEC3C, a nucleic acid-editing deaminase), inherently restrict Zika virus infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regulations of cellular mRNA decay and RNA splicing are compromised by Zika virus infection as well as by sfRNA alone.

We observed that the level of the antiviral enzyme APOBEC3C (apolipoprotein-B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3C (A3C)) preferentially increased upon the treatment with Art against tumor xenografts of p53-deficient H1299 cells. Using gain-of-function experiments, A3C could improve the therapeutic efficacy of Art, as determined by cell proliferation and colony formation assays. Furthermore, elevated A3C provoked a minor accumulation of \u03b3H2AX foci and the phosphorylation of RPA32 and Chk1, which strongly sensitized H1299 cells to Art. The employment of A3C also caused an increase in the synergistic interaction between Art and Chk1 inhibition. Besides, A3C overexpression delayed the cell cycle at the S phase, accompanied by attenuated G2/M arrest in the presence of Art. The enzymatic inactivation of A3C by the mutation of zinc-coordinating residues (C97S and C100S) indicated that A3C sensitized Art in a deaminase-dependent manner.

We also detected the BBB penetration of AZD3759 when combined with cranial radiation. The results showed the BBB penetration of AZD3759 was decreased within 24 hr after radiation, however, the free concentration of AZD3759 in brain kept at a high level in the context of radiation.

AZD3759 is a novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor with high capability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of AZD3759 in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with brain and leptomeningeal metastases. This open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study was undertaken at 11 centres and hospitals in Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the USA. Eligible patients included those with histologically confirmed, advanced-stage, EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The study was done in two parts, with dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases. In the dose-escalation phase, patients who had progressed after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor received AZD3759 at 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 500 mg twice a day. In the dose-expansion phase, AZD3759 at 200 mg or 300 mg twice a day was administered to patients with either brain or leptomeningeal metastases who had never received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and patients with leptomeningeal metastases who had been pretreated with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The primary objective was safety and tolerability, with severity of adverse events assessed with the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02228369\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02228369</a>. Between Nov 18, 2014, and Sept 7, 2016, 67 patients with NSCLC were enrolled into the study, 29 to the dose-escalation phase and 38 to the dose-expansion phase. At data cutoff (Dec 12, 2016), three (10%) patients in the dose-escalation phase and 20 (53%) in the dose-expansion phase were still receiving treatment. Dose-limiting toxic effects occurred in two (67%) of three patients who received 500 mg twice a day in the dose-escalation phase (grade 3 acne [n=1] and intolerable grade 2 mucosal inflammation [n=1]); hence, doses of 200 mg and 300 mg twice a day were selected for further assessment in the dose-expansion phase. Drug-related skin and gastrointestinal disorders of any grade occurred in 35 (92%) and 29 (76%) patients in the dose-expansion phase, respectively, and led to treatment discontinuation in one (4%) patient treated with 200 mg twice a day (grade 3 increase of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) and two (13%) patients given 300 mg twice a day (grade 3 diarrhoea [n=1] and grade 3 skin rash [n=1]). Grade 3 skin and gastrointestinal disorders occurred in four (17%) and two (9%) patients, respectively, at a dose of 200 mg twice a day, and in six (40%) and four (27%) patients, respectively, at a dose of 300 mg twice a day. No grade 4 disorders arose. Other grade 3 disorders included hepatobiliary and renal disorders (three [13%] at 200 mg twice a day), asthenia (one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day), infections and infestations (one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (one [4%] at 200 mg twice a day and one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day). AZD3759 at a dose of 200 mg twice daily showed a tolerable safety profile in patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases who had either never received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or who had been pretreated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The good penetration of the blood-brain barrier by AZD3759, and its promising clinical activity, support further assessment of this compound in studies. AstraZeneca.",

Patients harbouring these sensitizing mutations treated with EGFR TKI have derived significant clinical outcome when compared with standard platinum based chemotherapy doublets. However disease progression invariably occurs at a median of about 9-13 months from initiation treatment, if acquired resistance commonly due to the development of EGFR T790M mutation. A novel class of \"third generation\" EGFR TKIs have been developed that is sensitising and T790M mutant-specific whilst sparing WT EGFR, representing a significant breakthrough in the treatment in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance harboring these genotypes. Early phase clinical data suggest the third generation EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib, rociletinib, and HM61713 are highly efficacious and well tolerated. Another promising class of EGFR TKI such as AZD3759 has been designed to penetrate blood brain barrier to treat brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease and has showed promising responses in patients with brain metastases. Acquired resistance to third generation EGFR TKIs has been reported including EGFR C797S. Given its non-invasive nature, plasma ctDNA is being explored as a possible approach to detect T790M mutation and to also inform on novel molecular mechansims of tertiary resistance to third generation EGFR TKIs. An understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKIs will greatly aid in the development of the next generation of EGFR TKIs.",

CNS metastases remains a therapeutically challenging subset of patient to treat owing to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Prior to routine EGFR mutation testing, surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) were the main treatment options whereas treatment options for patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) included intra-thecal chemotherapy, WBRT, and ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. Unfortunately outcome for both BM and LM remains poor with median survival between 3 and 6 months. Systemic treatment with EGFR TKIs had been effective in the treatment of intracranial metastases but efficacy of early generation TKIs were hampered by its limited BBB penetration. The next generation EGFR TKIs osimertinib and AZD3759 have improved BBB penetration and the BLOOM study of osimertinib and AZD3759 has reported highly promising intracranial efficacy and may herald a new frontier to treat this therapeutically challenging subset of advanced EGFR mutant patients.",

Nucleosomes strongly prefer yeast DNA over Escherichia coli DNA, indicating that the yeast genome evolved to favor nucleosome formation. Many yeast promoter and terminator regions intrinsically disfavor nucleosome formation, and nucleosomes assembled in vitro show strong rotational positioning. Nucleosome arrays generated by the ACF assembly factor have fewer nucleosome-free regions, reduced rotational positioning and less translational positioning than obtained by intrinsic histone-DNA interactions. Notably, nucleosomes assembled in vitro have only a limited preference for specific translational positions and do not show the pattern observed in vivo. Our results argue against a genomic code for nucleosome positioning, and they suggest that the nucleosomal pattern in coding regions arises primarily from statistical positioning from a barrier near the promoter that involves some aspect of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II.",

To delineate nucleosomal patterns in a model genetic organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis in which DNA fragments corresponding to nucleosome cores were liberated using an enzyme (micrococcal nuclease) with a strong preference for cleavage in non-nucleosomal regions. Sequence analysis of 284,091 putative nucleosome cores obtained in this manner from a mixed-stage population of C. elegans reveals a combined picture of flexibility and constraint in nucleosome positioning. As has previously been observed in studies of individual loci in diverse biological systems, we observe areas in the genome where nucleosomes can adopt a wide variety of positions in a given region, areas with little or no nucleosome coverage, and areas where nucleosomes reproducibly adopt a specific positional pattern. In addition to illuminating numerous aspects of chromatin structure for C. elegans, this analysis provides a reference from which to begin an investigation of relationships between the nucleosomal pattern, chromosomal architecture, and lineage-based gene activity on a genome-wide scale.",

Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation, while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in nucleosome-depleted DNA tend to inhibit nucleosome formation, which is especially evident at nucleosome-disfavored sequences in nucleosome-free regions at both ends of genes. Sequence polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome positioning correspond to stable nucleosome positioning.

A common experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo.

We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26305225": "The fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome. Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity.",

In particular, the precise role of DNA sequence in shaping local chromatin structure has been controversial. This paper rigorously quantifies the contribution of hitherto-debated sequence features-including G+C content, 10.5 bp periodicity, and poly(dA:dT) tracts-to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome landscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. Our computational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and nucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to other previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase digestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, poly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the experimental method used. We further show that the 10.5 bp nucleotide periodicity facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying our method to in vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, the regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites can be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone. Finally, in vivo nucleosome occupancy derived from MNase-seq experiments around transcription termination sites can be mostly explained by the genomic sequence. Implications of these results and potential extensions of the proposed computational framework are discussed.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20232936": "Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., YYRR versus RYRY); (iii) we postulate that alternating AT-rich and GC-rich motifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and DNA in the minor groove. Using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions mapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, the pGUB plasmid, chicken beta-globin and three 5S rDNA genes). We predicted 15 of the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. The predicted position of the '601' nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the computed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by no more than 1 bp - an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. Our analysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be divided into two groups based on the positioning 'rules' they follow. The sequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable YR/YYRR motifs at the minor-groove bending sites SHL+/- 3.5 and +/- 5.5, which is similar to the alpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between histones H2A/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group (that includes the '601' clone) the same YR/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at the sites SHL +/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the central part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either an X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA). The results presented here may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking together structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the underlying DNA sequence patterns guiding their positions.",

We performed targeted WES analysis of DNA collected from the patient and her parents. We validated our findings by a similar analysis of DNA from 150 patients with very-early-onset IBD not associated with known genetic factors analyzed in Toronto, Oxford, and Munich. We compared gene expression signatures in inflamed vs noninflamed intestinal and rectal tissues collected from patients with treatment-resistant Crohn's disease who participated in a trial of ustekinumab. We performed functional studies of identified variants in primary cells from patients and cell culture. We identified a homozygous variant in the tripartite motif containing 22 gene (TRIM22) of the patient, as well as in 2 patients with a disease similar phenotype. Functional studies showed that the variant disrupted the ability of TRIM22 to regulate nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-dependent activation of interferon-beta signaling and nuclear factor-\u03baB. Computational studies demonstrated a correlation between the TRIM22-NOD2 network and signaling pathways and genetic factors associated very early onset and adult-onset IBD. TRIM22 is also associated with antiviral and mycobacterial effectors and markers of inflammation, such as fecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, and Crohn's disease activity index scores. In WES and targeted exome sequence analyses of an infant with severe IBD characterized by granulomatous colitis and severe perianal disease, we identified a homozygous variant of TRIM22 that affects the ability of its product to regulate NOD2.

Whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were performed to screen disease-associated NLRP3 variants from a cohort of children with VEOIBD. Inflammasome activation was determined in reconstituted HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells with NLRP3 inflammasome components, doxycycline-inducible NLRP3 macrophages, as well as PBMCs and biopsies from patients with NLRP3 variants. Pathogenesis of the variants was determined using a dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis model. We identified a dominant gain-of-function missense variant of NLRP3, encoded by rs772009059 (R779C), in 3 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Functional analysis revealed that R779C increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in macrophages. This was mediated by enhanced deubiquitination of NLRP3 via binding with deubiquitinases BRCC3 and JOSD2, which are highly expressed in myeloid cells. In a dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis model, NLRP3-R779C in hematopoietic cells resulted in more severe colitis, which can be ameliorated via knockdown of BRCC3 or JOSD2.

Treatment goals in severe hemophilia A are expanding beyond low annualized bleed rates to include long-term outcomes associated with high sustained FVIII levels.

Increasing recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) half-life further is ultimately dependent upon uncoupling rFVIII from endogenous VWF. We have developed a new class of FVIII replacement, rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN (BIVV001), that is physically decoupled from endogenous VWF and has enhanced pharmacokinetic properties compared with all previous FVIII products. BIVV001 was bioengineered as a unique fusion protein consisting of a VWF-D'D3 domain fused to rFVIII via immunoglobulin-G1 Fc domains and 2 XTEN polypeptides (Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Mountain View, CA).

To screen the optimal concentration and action time of thiazovivin for maintaining the morphology and function of primary HCECs, Na (+)/K (+)-ATPase and N-cadherin were chosen as indicators, and the morphology and function of HCECs in various concentrations(0 \u03bcmol/L, 2 \u03bcmol/L, 4 \u03bcmol/L, and 6 \u03bcmol/L)for different durations(24 h and 48 h)were examined by immunofluorescence experiments. The effect of thiazovivin on the expression of ROCK was investigated by immunofluorescence and Western blot. The primary HCECs cultured were hexagonal, closely packed, homogeneously and obviously stained by neuron-specific enolase. The immunofluorescence staining of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase showed that when the primary HCECs cultured with various concentrations of thiazovivin(0, 2, 4, 6 \u03bcmol/L)for 24 h, the fluorescence were obvious, and the average absorbance values(A)were 1.27\u00b10.08, 3.72\u00b10.17, 21.07\u00b14.67, 3.69\u00b10.34, respectively. And the immunofluorescence staining of N-cadherin revealed that when the primary HCECs treated with 4 \u03bcmol/L thiazovivin for 24 h, the cell boundary was clear and the structure of the cells was intact. While the treating time of thiazovivin(4 \u03bcmol/L)on HCECs extended to 48 h, the immunofluorescence staining of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and N-cadherin showed that compared to HCECs treated with thiazovivin(4 \u03bcmol/L)for 24 h, the fluorescence intensity did not change significantly, but the cells arranged slightly untidy. In addition, the immunofluorescence staining of ROCK was weakened and the expression of ROCK was reduced by thiazovivin. Thiazovivin was effective for protecting the morphology and function of HCECs. An optimal improvement in the morphology, connection and function of HCECs was found when the primary HCECs were cultured with 4 \u03bcmol/L thiazovivin for 24 h. Moreover, the expression of ROCK protein could be significantly inhibited by thiazovivin. (Chin J Ophthalmol, 2016, 52: 686-692).",

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) is considered a promising resource for restorative cell therapy in clinical areas. While fully reprogrammed iPSCs are similar to embryonic stem cells, iPSCs could be derived from the patient's own cells (autologous), which avoids the immune rejection activities. Recent advances have demonstrated that iPSCs could be generated from human fibroblasts using only four transcription factors: OCT4, SOX2, CMYC, and KLF4. However, the limitations of reprogramming technologies include low efficiency, slow kinetics, transgene integration and residual expression. Surprisingly, adult stem cells from human endometrium (endometrial stem cells; EnSCs) express OCT4 and KLF4 pluripotency factors. On the other hand, small molecule inhibitors of specific signaling pathways such as thiazovivin have been used in various aspects of iPSC generation and maintenance. Thiazovivin is a selective small molecule that directly targets Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and increases expression of pluripotency factors. The process using thiazovivin could be easier, faster and more cost effective than transgene integration into somatic cells. So reprogramming of OCT4 and KLF4 expressing EnSCs by a ROCK inhibitor, thiazovivin, could result in producing more efficient iPSCs compared with fibroblasts or conventional somatic cells without integration any transgene and retroviral vector.",

Little is known about the molecular composition and structure of the Barr body or the mechanisms leading to its formation in female nuclei. Because human sera from patients with autoimmune diseases often contain antibodies against a variety of cellular components, we reasoned that some autoimmune sera may contain antibodies against proteins associated with the Barr body. Therefore, we screened autoimmune sera by immunofluorescence of human fibroblasts and identified one serum that immunostained a distinct nuclear structure with a size and nuclear localization consistent with the Barr body. The number of these structures was consistent with the number of Barr bodies expected in diploid female fibroblasts containing two to five X chromosomes. Immunostaining with the serum followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe against XIST RNA demonstrated that the major fluorescent signal from the autoantibody colocalized with XIST RNA. Further analysis of the serum showed that it stains human metaphase chromosomes and a nuclear structure consistent with the inactive X in female mouse fibroblasts. However, it does not exhibit localization to a Barr body-like structure in female mouse embryonic stem cells or in cells from female mouse E7.5 embryos. The lack of staining of the inactive X in cells from female E7.5 embryos suggests the antigen(s) may be involved in X inactivation at a stage subsequent to initiation of X inactivation. This demonstration of an autoantibody recognizing an antigen(s) associated with the Barr body presents a strategy for identifying molecular components of the Barr body and examining the molecular basis of X inactivation.",

The debated link between BRCA1 and Xi might reflect a general relationship between BRCA1 and heterochromatin, which could connect BRCA1 to both epigenetic and genetic instability.

The centromeres of inactive X chromosomes (Barr bodies) were located closer to the nuclear periphery as compared with the centromeres of active X chromosomes. In addition, it was established that the nuclear radial position of gene-rich chromosome 1 was changed in XXXXY cells as compared to normal XY cells.

The steady-state levels of O-GlcNAc are influenced by extracellular glucose concentrations suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation may serve as a metabolic sensor. Intriguingly, human OGT is located on the X-chromosome (Xq13) close to the X-inactivation center (XIC), suggesting that OGT levels may be controlled by dosage compensation. In human female cells, dosage compensation is accomplished by X-inactivation. Long noncoding RNAs and polycomb repression act together to produce an inactive X chromosome, or Barr body. Given that OGT has an established role in polycomb repression, it is uniquely poised to auto-regulate its own expression through X-inactivation. In this study, we examined OGT expression in male, female and triple-X female human fibroblasts, which differ in the number of inactive X chromosomes (Xi). We demonstrate that OGT is subjected to random X-inactivation in normal female and triple X cells to regulate OGT RNA levels. In addition, we used chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) and immunolocalization to examine O-GlcNAc levels in the Xi/Barr body. Despite the established role of O-GlcNAc in polycomb repression, OGT and target proteins bearing O-GlcNAc are largely depleted from the highly condensed Barr body. Thus, while O-GlcNAc is abundantly present elsewhere in the nucleus, its absence from the Barr body suggests that the transcriptional quiescence of the Xi does not require OGT or O-GlcNAc.",

Despite being known for over 50 years, relatively few components of the Barr body have been identified. In this study, we have screened over 30 histone variants, modified histones and non-histone proteins for their association with or exclusion from the Barr body. We demonstrate that, similar to the histone variant macroH2A, heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1), histone H1 and the high mobility group protein HMG-I/Y are elevated at the territory of the Xi in interphase in human cell lines, but only when the Xi chromatin is heteropycnotic, implicating each as a component of the Barr body. Surprisingly, however, virtually all other candidate proteins involved in establishing heterochromatin and gene silencing are notably absent from the Barr body despite being localized generally elsewhere throughout the nucleus, indicating that the Barr body represents a discrete subnuclear compartment that is not freely accessible to most chromatin proteins. A similar dichotomous pattern of association or exclusion describes the spatial relationship of a number of specific histone methylation patterns in relation to the Barr body. Notably, though, several methylated forms of histone H3 that are deficient in Xi chromatin generally are present at a region near the macrosatellite repeat DXZ4, as are the chromatin proteins CTCF and SAP30, indicating a distinctive chromatin state in this region of the Xi. Taken together, our data imply that the Xi adopts a distinct chromatin configuration in interphase nuclei and are consistent with a mechanism by which HP1, through histone H3 lysine-9 methylation, recognizes and assists in maintaining heterochromatin and gene silencing at the human Xi.",

These two histone marks are distributed in distinct domains, and X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) preferentially colocalizes with H3K27me3 domains. Here we show that Xi compaction requires HBiX1, a heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-binding protein, and structural maintenance of chromosomes hinge domain-containing protein 1 (SMCHD1), both of which are enriched throughout the Xi chromosome. HBiX1 localization to H3K9me3 and XIST-associated H3K27me3 (XIST-H3K27me3) domains was mediated through interactions with HP1 and SMCHD1, respectively. Furthermore, HBiX1 was required for SMCHD1 localization to H3K9me3 domains. Depletion of HBiX1 or SMCHD1, but not Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), resulted in Xi decompaction, similarly to XIST depletion.

Here we employ quantitative live imaging methods and mathematical modeling to test the effect of the pioneer factor Zelda on transcriptional dynamics and memory in Drosophila embryos. We demonstrate that increasing the number of Zelda binding sites accelerates the kinetics of nuclei transcriptional activation regardless of their transcriptional past. Despite its known pioneering activities, we show that Zelda does not remain detectably associated with mitotic chromosomes and is neither necessary nor sufficient to foster memory. We further reveal that Zelda forms sub-nuclear dynamic hubs where Zelda binding events are transient. We propose that Zelda facilitates transcriptional activation by accumulating in microenvironments where it could accelerate the duration of multiple pre-initiation steps.",

Recently, we showed that Zelda acts through specific chromatin patterns of histone modifications to mark developmental enhancers and active promoters. Intriguingly, some Zelda sites still maintain these chromatin patterns in Drosophila embryos lacking maternal Zelda protein. This suggests that additional Zelda-like pioneer factors may act in early fly embryos. We developed a computational method to analyze and refine the chromatin landscape surrounding early Zelda peaks, using a multichannel spectral clustering. This allowed us to characterize their chromatin patterns through MZT (mitotic cycles 8-14). Specifically, we focused on H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K18ac, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 and identified three different classes of chromatin signatures, matching \"promoters,\" \"enhancers\" and \"transiently bound\" Zelda peaks. We then further scanned the genome using these chromatin patterns and identified additional loci-with no Zelda binding-that show similar chromatin patterns, resulting with hundreds of Zelda-independent putative enhancers. These regions were found to be enriched with GAGA factor (GAF, Trl) and are typically located near early developmental zygotic genes. Overall our analysis suggests that GAF, together with Zelda, plays an important role in activating the zygotic genome. As we show, our computational approach offers an efficient algorithm for characterizing chromatin signatures around some loci of interest and allows a genome-wide identification of additional loci with similar chromatin patterns.",

Such priming is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl). Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs. Without Zld, Dl binding decreases at enhancers and redistributes to open regions devoid of enhancer activity. We propose that Zld primes enhancers by lowering the high nucleosome barrier just enough to assist TFs in accessing their binding motifs and promoting spatially controlled enhancer activation if the right patterning TFs are present. We envision that genome activators in general will utilize this mechanism to activate the zygotic genome in a robust and precise manner.",

During this developmental transition, the zygotic genome is largely transcriptionally quiescent and undergoes significant chromatin remodeling. In Drosophila, the DNA-binding protein Zelda (also known as Vielfaltig) is required for this transition and for transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. Open chromatin is associated with Zelda-bound loci, as well as more generally with regions of active transcription. Nonetheless, the extent to which Zelda influences chromatin accessibility across the genome is largely unknown. Here we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements to determine the role of Zelda in regulating regions of open chromatin in the early embryo. We demonstrate that Zelda is essential for hundreds of regions of open chromatin. This Zelda-mediated chromatin accessibility facilitates transcription-factor recruitment and early gene expression. Thus, Zelda possesses some key characteristics of a pioneer factor. Unexpectedly, chromatin at a large subset of Zelda-bound regions remains open even in the absence of Zelda. The GAGA factor-binding motif and embryonic GAGA factor binding are specifically enriched in these regions.

Experiments in Drosophila and zebrafish have revealed that ZGA depends on transcription factors that provide large-scale control of gene expression by direct and specific binding to gene regulatory sequences. Zelda (Zld) plays such a role in the Drosophila embryo, where it has been shown to control the action of patterning signals; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unclear. A recent model proposed that Zld binding sites act as quantitative regulators of the spatiotemporal expression of genes activated by Dorsal (Dl), the morphogen that patterns the dorsoventral axis. Here we tested this model experimentally, using enhancers of brinker (brk) and short gastrulation (sog), both of which are directly activated by Dl, but at different concentration thresholds. In agreement with the model, we show that there is a clear positive correlation between the number of Zld binding sites and the spatial domain of enhancer activity. Likewise, the timing of expression could be advanced or delayed. We present evidence that Zld facilitates binding of Dl to regulatory DNA, and that this is associated with increased chromatin accessibility. Importantly, the change in chromatin accessibility is strongly correlated with the change in Zld binding, but not Dl.

In Drosophila melanogaster, Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) occurs in two waves, starting respectively at mitotic cycles 8 (approximately 60 genes) and 14 (over a thousand genes). The regulatory mechanisms underlying these drastic transcriptional changes remain largely unknown. We developed an original gene clustering method based on discretized transition profiles, and applied it to datasets from three landmark early embryonic transcriptome studies. We identified 417 genes significantly up-regulated during ZGA. De novo motif discovery returned nine motifs over-represented in their non-coding sequences (upstream, introns, UTR), three of which correspond to previously known transcription factors: Zelda, Tramtrack and Trithorax-like (Trl). The nine discovered motifs were combined to scan ZGA-associated regions and predict about 1300 putative cis-regulatory modules. The fact that Trl is known to act as chromatin remodelling factor suggests that epigenetic regulation might play an important role in zygotic genome activation. We thus systematically compared the locations of predicted CRMs with ChIP-seq profiles for various transcription factors, 38 epigenetic marks from ModENCODE, and DNAse1 accessibility profiles. This analysis highlighted a strong and specific enrichment of predicted ZGA-associated CRMs for Zelda, CBP, Trl binding sites, as well as for histone marks associated with active enhancers (H3K4me1) and for open chromatin regions. Based on the results of our computational analyses, we suggest a temporal model explaining the onset of zygotic genome activation by the combined action of transcription factors and epigenetic signals. Although this study is mainly based on the analysis of publicly available transcriptome and ChiP-seq datasets, the resulting model suggests novel mechanisms that underly the coordinated activation of several hundreds genes at a precise time point during embryonic development.",

We studied Zelda in the cockroach Blattella germanica, a hemimetabolan, short germ-band, and polyneopteran species. B. germanica Zelda has the complete set of functional domains, which is typical of species displaying ancestral features concerning embryogenesis. Interestingly, we found D. melanogaster TAGteam heptamers in the B. germanica genome. The canonical one, CAGGTAG, is present at a similar proportion in the genome of these two species and in the genome of other insects, suggesting that the genome admits as many CAGGTAG motifs as its length allows. Zelda-depleted embryos of B. germanica show defects involving blastoderm formation and abdomen development, and genes contributing to these processes are down-regulated. We conclude that in B. germanica, Zelda strictly activates the zygotic genome, within the MZT, a role conserved in more derived endopterygote insects. In B. germanica, zelda is expressed during MZT, whereas in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum it is expressed beyond this transition. In these species and A. mellifera, Zelda has functions even in postembryonic development. The expansion of zelda expression beyond the MZT in endopterygotes might be related with the evolutionary innovation of holometabolan metamorphosis.

Our results demonstrate roles for zld not only during the MZT, but also in posterior segmentation and patterning of imaginal disc derived structures. Further, we also demonstrate that zld is critical for posterior segmentation in the hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus, indicating this function predates the origin of holometabolous insects and was subsequently lost in long-germ insects.

TAGteam motifs are present and well conserved in highly bound regions, and are associated with transcription factor binding even in the absence of canonical recognition motifs for these factors. Furthermore, levels of binding in promoters and enhancers of zygotically transcribed genes are correlated with RNA polymerase II occupancy and gene expression levels.

We find that regions of accessibility are established sequentially, where enhancers are opened in advance of promoters and insulators. These open states are stably maintained in highly condensed mitotic chromatin to ensure faithful inheritance of prior accessibility status across cell divisions. The temporal progression of establishment is controlled by the biological timers that control the onset of the MBT. In general, acquisition of promoter accessibility is controlled by the biological timer that measures the nucleo-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, whereas timing of enhancer accessibility is regulated independently of the N:C ratio.

Chromatin accessibility at OCT4-bound sites requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1, which is recruited to these sites by OCT4 to support additional transcription factor binding and expression of the pluripotency-associated transcriptome. Furthermore, the requirement for BRG1 in shaping OCT4 binding reflects how these target sites are used during cellular reprogramming and early mouse development.

In nucleotide excision repair ZRF1 remodels E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes at the damage site.

Reconstituted transcription reactions established that the Brahma (BRM) chromatin-remodeling complex is essential for Zeste-directed activation on nucleosomal templates. Because it is not required for Zeste to bind to chromatin, the BRM complex appears to act after promoter binding by the activator. Purification of the Drosophila BRM complex revealed a number of novel subunits. We found that Zeste tethers the BRM complex via direct binding to specific subunits, including trxG proteins Moira (MOR) and OSA. The leucine zipper of Zeste mediates binding to MOR. Interestingly, although the Imitation Switch (ISWI) remodelers are potent nucleosome spacing factors, they are dispensable for transcriptional activation by Zeste. Thus, there is a distinction between general chromatin restructuring and transcriptional coactivation by remodelers.

The primary endpoint was the rate of HPR, defined as VerifyNow-P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) &gt;235, at 24 h post loading. Prasugrel achieved a lower PRU compared to clopidogrel after loading (119 [56-175] vs. 245 [189-299]), at 24 h (34 [8-58] vs. 196 [122-244]), and at 30 days (134 [98-189] vs. 203 [144-248]). Prasugrel had a lower rate of HPR after loading (5.7% vs. 57.1%, p &lt;0.001), at 24 h (2.9% vs. 28.6%, p=0.006), and at 30 days (11.4% vs. 34.3%, p=0.004). Prasugrel had a similar rate of optimal platelet reactivity at 30 days (71.4% vs. 60.0%, p=0.450). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of periprocedural myonecrosis within 48 h after PCI with clopidogrel and prasugrel (22.9% vs. 17.1%, p&gt;0.960). Half-dose prasugrel provided potent platelet inhibition in NSTE-ACS patients that were carriers of the CYP2C19*2 or *3 allele, with a lower rate of HPR. Periprocedural myonecrosis was not significantly different in the 2 groups.",

Here, we integrate measures of how essential a gene is to supporting life, as inferred from viability and phenotyping screens performed on knockout mice by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium and essentiality screens carried out on human cell lines. We propose a cross-species gene classification across the Full Spectrum of Intolerance to Loss-of-function (FUSIL) and demonstrate that genes in five mutually exclusive FUSIL categories have differing biological properties. Most notably, Mendelian disease genes, particularly those associated with developmental disorders, are highly overrepresented among genes non-essential for cell survival but required for organism development. After screening developmental disorder cases from three independent disease sequencing consortia, we identify potentially pathogenic variants in genes not previously associated with rare diseases. We therefore propose FUSIL as an efficient approach for disease gene discovery.",

In Phase Ib, patients received INC280 as capsules or tablets in combination with buparlisib. In Phase II, patients received INC280 only. Response was assessed centrally using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology response criteria for high-grade gliomas. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded and graded. 33 patients entered Phase Ib, 32 with altered PTEN. RP2D was not declared due to potential drug-drug interactions, which may have resulted in lack of efficacy; thus, Phase II, including 10 patients, was continued with INC280 monotherapy only. Best response was stable disease in 30% of patients. In the selected patient population, enrollment was halted due to limited activity with INC280 monotherapy. In Phase Ib, the most common treatment-related AEs were fatigue (36.4%), nausea (30.3%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (30.3%). MTD was identified at INC280 Tab 300 mg twice daily + buparlisib 80 mg once daily. In Phase II, the most common AEs were headache (40.0%), constipation (30.0%), fatigue (30.0%) and increased lipase (30.0%).

Patients affected by leishmaniasis; a neglected tropical disease, confront serious problems for their treatment including resistance to common drugs as well as toxicity and high cost of therapy. So, there is a need for development of new drug candidates to control the diseases. Jellein, a peptide derived from royal jelly of honeybee has been shown to have promising effect against several bacterial and fungal species.

Moreover, cytotoxic effect of these peptides was studied in THP1 cell line and human Red Blood Cells (RBCs). Furthermore, the mechanism of action of peptides on L. major promastigotes was assessed through different methods. The results demonstrated that, conjugation of lauric acid to Jellein not only had no effect on the elevation of antimicrobial activity but also halted it completely.

Data were retrieved from scientific articles published in 1990-2014, a period comprising the development and the 10 years following the HGP completion. The fact that only 20,000 genes are protein and RNA-coding is one of the most striking HGP results. A new concept about the organization of genome arose. The ENCODE project was initiated in 2003 and targeted to map the functional elements of the human genome. This project revealed that the human genome is pervasively transcribed. Therefore, it was determined that a large part of the non-protein coding regions are functional. Finally, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure emerged. The mechanistic functioning of the genome has been redrafted, revealing a much more complex picture. Besides, a gene-centric conception of the organism has to be reviewed. A number of criticisms have emerged against the ENCODE project approaches, raising the question of whether non-conserved but biochemically active regions are truly functional.

A number of novel and promising cancer targets have emerged from the genome project for diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostic markers, which are being used to monitor response to cancer treatment. The heterogeneous nature of cancer has hindered progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to abnormal cellular growth. Since, the start of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the International Genome consortium projects, there has been tremendous progress in genome sequencing and immense numbers of cancer genomes have been completed, and this approach has transformed our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of different types of cancers. By employing Genomics and proteomics technologies, an immense amount of genomic data is being generated on clinical tumors, which has transformed the cancer landscape and has the potential to transform cancer diagnosis and prognosis. A complete molecular view of the cancer landscape is necessary for understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer initiation to improve diagnosis and prognosis, which ultimately will lead to personalized treatment. Interestingly, cancer proteome analysis has also allowed us to identify biomarkers to monitor drug and radiation resistance in patients undergoing cancer treatment. Further, TCGA-funded studies have allowed for the genomic and transcriptomic characterization of targeted cancers, this analysis aiding the development of targeted therapies for highly lethal malignancy.

Accordingly, our overall understanding of genome organization remains incomplete. Here, we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles.

Especially in complex eukaryotes, data generated by these methods, coupled with other genome-wide datasets, demonstrated that non-random chromatin folding correlates strongly with cellular processes such as gene expression and DNA replication. We describe a genome architecture assay, tethered multiple 3C (TM3C), that maps genome-wide chromatin contacts via a simple protocol of restriction enzyme digestion and religation of fragments upon agarose gel beads followed by paired-end sequencing. In addition to identifying contacts between pairs of loci, TM3C enables identification of contacts among more than two loci simultaneously. We use TM3C to assay the genome architectures of two human cell lines: KBM7, a near-haploid chronic leukemia cell line, and NHEK, a normal diploid human epidermal keratinocyte cell line. We confirm that the contact frequency maps produced by TM3C exhibit features characteristic of existing genome architecture datasets, including the expected scaling of contact probabilities with genomic distance, megabase scale chromosomal compartments and sub-megabase scale topological domains. We also confirm that TM3C captures several known cell type-specific contacts, ploidy shifts and translocations, such as Philadelphia chromosome formation (Ph+) in KBM7. We confirm a subset of the triple contacts involving the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) using PCR analysis for KBM7 cells. Our genome-wide analysis of pairwise and triple contacts demonstrates their preference for linking open chromatin regions to each other and for linking regions with higher numbers of DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs) to each other. For near-haploid KBM7 cells, we infer whole genome 3D models that exhibit clustering of small chromosomes with each other and large chromosomes with each other, consistent with previous studies of the genome architectures of other human cell lines. TM3C is a simple protocol for ascertaining genome architecture and can be used to identify simultaneous contacts among three or four loci.

We report 12 radiological partial responses and 9 of 31 histological complete responses. Thirty-two patients experienced further relapses, and 13 continued in complete remission after surgical resection of the residual disease. Three-year overall survival was 40%, and 3-year progression-free survival was 24%. Delay of relapse (+/- 2 years from diagnosis) was a prognostic factor (P = 0.011). No acute toxic serious adverse event occurred. Conclusion. The use of HD thiotepa and ASCT is feasible in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma. A randomized study for recurrent osteosarcoma between standard salvage chemotherapy and high dose thiotepa with stem cell rescue is ongoing.",

These proteins provide the key catalytic activity of the \u03b3-secretase complex in the cleavage of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein and resultant amyloid tangle deposition. Over the last 25 years, screening novel drugs to control this aberrant proteolytic activity has yet to identify effective treatments for the disease. In the search for other mechanisms of presenilin pathology, several studies have demonstrated that mammalian presenilin proteins also act in a non-proteolytic role as a scaffold to co-localize key signaling proteins. This role is likely to represent an ancestral presenilin function, as it has been described in genetically distant species including non-mammalian animals, plants, and a simple eukaryotic amoeba Dictyostelium that diverged from the human lineage over a billion years ago. Here, we review the non-catalytic scaffold role of presenilin, from mammalian models to other biomedical models, and include recent insights using Dictyostelium, to suggest that this role may provide an early evolutionary function of presenilin proteins.",

It now appears that an integrated proteolytic network operates within the epidermis, comprising more than 30 enzymes that carry out a growing list of essential functions. Equally, defective regulation or execution of protease-mediated processes is emerging as a key contributor to diverse human skin pathologies, and in recent years the number of diseases attributable to aberrant proteolytic activity has more than doubled.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18565216": " In the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, lymphocytic infiltration is preceded by an accumulation of dendritic cells in the submandibular glands (SMGs). NOD mice also exhibit an increased frequency of mature, fractalkine receptor (CX3C chemokine receptor [CX3CR]1) expressing monocytes, which are considered to be precursors for tissue dendritic cells. To unravel further the role played by fractalkine-CX3CR1 interactions in the salivary gland inflammation, we studied the expression of fractalkine in NOD SMGs. We studied protein expression using Western blot analysis of whole tissue lysates. Protease activity was measured in salivary gland tissue lysates using fluorimetric substrates. Digestive capacity of enzymes was determined by in vitro incubation of recombinant enzyme and fractalkine, followed by protein staining and Western blot. Fractalkine was detected in salivary glands of both NOD and control mice at all ages. Western blot analysis showed fractalkine cleavage with increasing age, which was more pronounced in NOD mice. This cleavage resulted in a decrease in the 31 kDa form of the protein, and the generation of an approximately 19 kDa band. Furthermore, in NOD animals older than 15 weeks, we noted the presence of a unique approximately 17 kDa fragment. This cleavage was organ specific, because it did not occur in brain or pancreas. Increased gelatinase and alpha-secretase activity were detected in NOD SMG and contributed to cleavage of the 31 kDa protein. Because aberrant cleavage products may induce autoimmunity, we studied the presence of autoantibodies against fractalkine. Indeed, NOD mice exhibited significantly more antibodies against fractalkine than did control animals. These data indicate that aberrant proteolytic activity in the NOD SMG results in increased fractalkine cleavage and generation of a unique fractalkine fragment. This specific cleavage may contribute to autoimmunity.",

Various attempts have been made to modify the different steps in the in vitro protocol for the Comet assay in order to improve its sensitivity. However, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has tried to replace the traditionally used NaOH-based electrophoresis solution (pH &gt; 13), with another type of solution. In the present paper, using TK-6 cells exposed to different concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or ionizing radiation, we present evidence clearly showing that a low-conductive LiOH-based electrophoresis solution at pH 12.5, and a more gentle lysis procedure, significantly improved both the speed and sensitivity of the assay. The new approach, which we call the Flash-comet, is based on a lysis buffer at pH 8.5, an unwinding time of 2.5 min in a LiOH solution without EDTA at pH 12.5, and an electrophoresis time of 1 min at 150 V (5 V/cm) using the same solution.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19712750": "Phototherapy (PT) is the most widely used form of treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. One possible harmful consequence of PT is of a genetic nature. High levels of bilirubin may lead to oxidative damage in newborns: photochemical reactions may produce toxic photoproducts, probably peroxides. In order to investigate this hypothesis further under in vivo conditions, DNA strand-break frequency was examined by means of the comet assay in peripheral lymphocytes of icteric newborns undergoing PT treatment, and the levels of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme, were determined. We analyzed 20 term non-hemolitic hyperbilirubinemic jaundiced neonates before PT ('before PT' group) and just prior to ending PT ('after PT' group) and compared comet scores of these patients with those of 20 healthy term neonates who all had bilirubin levels in the physiological range. Comet scores (tail length, tail moment and %DNA in tail) of the group 'before phototherapy' were 23.5 +/- 16.3, 7.41 (0.97-40.7), 33.0 +/- 12.1, respectively and scores of after phototherapy group were 3.2 +/- 1.8, 0.29 (0.3-3.2), 10.7 +/- 3.7, respectively. Comet scores of the control group were 3.0 +/- 2.9, 0.25 (0.03-3.22), 10.9 +/- 4.5, respectively. Comet scores and plasma catalase activities in hyperbilirubinemic newborns were significantly higher before phototherapy, compared with the values after phototherapy and in the control groups (p &lt; 0.001). There was no statistical difference between the 'after phototherapy' group and the controls (p &gt; 0.05). These results indicate that high serum bilirubin level has genotoxic effects as is evident from the high rate of DNA strand-breaks in jaundiced newborns. Also PT does not cause an increase in DNA oxidation or induce the genotoxic effects of bilirubin. The counteracting effect of higher catalase activities in hyperbilirubinemic newborns may be responsible for the inactivating toxic and DNA-damaging effects of PT.",

Development of methods to measure the extent of migration of DNA from single cells permitted detection of initial radiation-induced DNA breaks present in each cell. As cells need not be radiolabeled, there were new opportunities for analysis of radiation effects on cells from virtually any tissue, provided a single cell suspension could be prepared. The comet assay (as this method was subsequently named) was able to measure, for the first time, the fraction of radiobiologically hypoxic cells in mouse and human tumors. It was used to determine that the rate of rejoining of DNA breaks was relatively homogenous within an irradiated population of cells. Because individual cells were analyzed, heavily damaged or apoptotic cells could be identified and eliminated from analysis to determine \"true\" DNA strand break rejoining rates. Other examples of applications of the comet assay in radiobiology research include analysis of the inter-individual differences in response to radiation, effect of hypoxia modifying agents on tumor hypoxic fraction, the role of cell cycle position during DNA break induction and rejoining, non-targeted effects on bystander cells, and effects of charged particles on DNA fragmentation patterns.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8676929": "The comet assay is frequently used to measure DNA damage in individual cells. In order to better understand the mechanisms behind the technique, we have studied the behaviour of DNA under different electrophoresis conditions in mammalian cells exposed to gamma radiation. The comet tails obtained after neutral electrophoresis seem to consist of DNA loops which are attached to structures in the nucleus, since the DNA cannot move in the second direction after two-dimensional electrophoresis. When the DNA is labelled by a short pulse, microautoradiography reveals that all label appear in the head of the comets when neutral electrophoresis is applied. After chase incubation, the label moves out into the tails. This gives further support to the view that the DNA loops are fixed to some structure in the nucleus where also the DNA synthesis takes place. Under alkaline electrophoresis conditions, however, the entire comet tails move in the new electrophoresis direction. Thus, it appears that the alkaline comet tails consist of free DNA fragments. Further, the effects of alkaline concentration and sodium chloride during unwinding and electrophoresis are discussed. Throughout the study, a protocol for drying and fixation of the comets has been used.",

Gamma-irradiation of tobacco seedlings induced a dose-dependent increase in somatic mutations from 0.5 (control) to 240 per leaf (10Gy). The increased yield of somatic mutations was highly correlated (r = 0.996) with the increased DNA damage measured by the Comet assay immediately after irradiation. With increased dose of gamma-irradiation, the averaged median tail moment values ( +/- S.E.) significantly increased from 1.08 +/- 0.10 (control) to 20.26 +/- 1.61 microm (10Gy). Nuclei isolated from leaves 24h after irradiation expressed tail moment values that were not significantly different from the control (2.08 +/- 0.11). Thus a complete repair of DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation and measurable by the Comet assay was observed, whereas the yield of somatic mutations increased in relation to the radiation dose. Data on the kinetics of DNA repair and of DNA damage induced by gamma-radiation on isolated tobacco nuclei, and on nuclei isolated from irradiated leaves and roots are presented.",

Under accidental situations, large quantities of radioactive elements get released into the environment and radiation emitted from these radionuclides may adversely affect both the man and the non-human biota. The present study is aimed (a) to know the genotoxic effect of gamma radiation on aquatic fauna employing two species of selected bivalves, (b) to evaluate the possible use of 'Comet assay' for detecting genetic damage in haemocytes of bivalves as a biomarker for environmental biomonitoring and also (c) to compare the relative sensitivity of two species of bivalves viz. Paphia malabarica and Meretrix casta to gamma radiation. The comet assays was optimized and validated using different concentrations (18, 32 and 56 mg/L) of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), a direct-acting reference genotoxic agent, to which the bivalves were exposed for various times (24, 48 and 72 h). Bivalves were irradiated (single acute exposure) with 5 different doses (viz. 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 Gy) of gamma radiation and their genotoxic effects on the haemocytes were studied using the comet assay. Haemolymph was collected from the adductor muscle at 24, 48 and 72 h of both EMS-exposed and irradiated bivalves and comet assay was carried out using standard protocol. A significant increase in DNA damage was observed as indicated by an increase in % tail DNA damage at different concentrations of EMS and all the doses of gamma radiation as compared to controls in both bivalve species. This showed a dose-dependent increase of genetic damage induced in bivalves by EMS as well as gamma radiation. Further, the highest DNA damage was observed at 24h. The damage gradually decreased with time, i.e. was smaller at 48 and 72 h than at 24h post irradiation in both species of bivalves. This may indicate repair of the damaged DNA and/or loss of heavily damaged cells as the post irradiation time advanced. The present study reveals that gamma radiation induces single strand breaks in DNA as measured by alkaline comet assay in bivalves and comet assay serves as a sensitive and rapid method to detect genotoxicity of gamma radiation. This study further indicates that both M. casta and P. malabarica exhibit almost identical sensitivity to gamma radiation as measured by DNA damage.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147573": "The single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, more commonly known as the comet assay, due to the \"comet-like\" appearance of the cells, was originally developed as a technique to measure the presence of DNA single-strand breaks. The assay is performed on single cells embedded in agar and placed in an electrical field at alkaline pH, so that fragments of negatively charged single-stranded DNA move through the gel toward the positively charged anode. Undamaged DNA moves relatively slowly, forming the head of the comet, while DNA fragmented due to the presence of single-strand breaks, moves more quickly giving the appearance of the tail. The extent of DNA migration is a measure of the DNA damage present. Since it was first developed, the comet assay has been adapted for measuring other types of DNA damage. The neutral comet assay has been employed for DNA double-strand breaks, while techniques using DNA repair enzymes to cleave specific adducts, UvrABC for ultraviolet radiation induced adducts, for example, have also been described. Here, we describe a modified version of the comet assay for the measurement of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Interstrand crosslinking agents include the chemotherapeutic agents mitomycin C and cis-platin, psoralen plus UVA light (PUVA) used to treat hyperproliferative skin disorders and diepoxybutane, a metabolite of 1,3-butadiene used in industrial processes and an environmental pollutant. ICLs are a potent and cytotoxic form of DNA damage as they prevent DNA strand separation, thereby preventing DNA replication. Their removal requires several different DNA repair processes including translesion synthesis and homologous recombination. As ICLs prevent separation of the DNA strands, their presence results in less DNA migration in the comet assay. To successfully measure ICLs, it is necessary to incorporate a step that induces single-strand breaks (using a defined dose of ionizing radiation) that allows the crosslinked DNA to migrate.",

There is still uncertainty about the reliability of this method. By comparing the comet assay with a flow cytometry method that uses Annexin V binding to apoptotic cells, we have provided further evidence for evaluating the usefulness of the comet assay for detecting apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by ionizing radiation and measured using the comet assay and a flow cytometry method that measures Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. The Annexin V flow cytometry assay distinguished among early apoptosis, late apoptosis, and an apoptotic or necrotic phase in which the cells were labeled with both Annexin V and PI. The comet assay detected only the latter two phases of apoptosis. The comet assay is a useful tool for measuring the late stages of apoptosis whereas the Annexin V assay measures higher amounts of apoptosis because it can detect cells in an earlier stage of the apoptotic pathway.",

An analysis of DNA damage following gamma radiation ((60)Cobalt) treatments at a dose of 0.5 and 1.0 kGy (Kilo Gray) has been carried out with cells obtained from the larvae, pupae and adults of S. zeamais. Gamma radiation induced significant damage at DNA level in the experimental larvae, pupae and adults as manifested by increased strand breaks compared to intact cells from non-irradiated ones. Comet assay revealed that tail length and % tail DNA varied significantly for all developmental stages of S. zeamais. This study suggests that the comet assay would be a potentially useful tool for detecting DNA damage in insect pest control strategies due to its advantages in the requirement of small numbers of cells per sample and sensitivity in detecting low levels of DNA damage.",

However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",

Using single cell gel electrophoresis (e.g., Comet Assay) and immunofluoresence microscopy to detect the presence of gamma-H2AX foci, we find that Cr[VI] induces DNA double-strand breaks similar to ionizing radiation (IR). We also demonstrated that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is activated in response to Cr[VI] and exposure to Cr[VI] triggers a dose and ATM-dependent S-phase arrest. Further, we document that ATM is required for phosphorylation of the structural maintenance of chromosome protein 1 (SMC1). Finally, we find that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of SMC1 is required to facilitate S-phase cell-cycle arrest in response to Cr[VI] exposure. Collectively, these results indicate that the ATM-SMC1 pathway plays a critical role in cellular response to Cr[VI].",

Besides its known direct DNA-damaging and mutagenic activity in sufficiently exposed cells, FA at low concentrations might also enhance the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of other environmental mutagens by interfering with the repair of DNA lesions induced by these mutagens. To further assess potential co-mutagenic effects of FA, we exposed A549 human lung cells to FA in combination with various mutagens and measured the induction and removal of DNA damage by the comet assay and the production of chromosomal mutations by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN assay). The mutagens tested were ionizing radiation (IR), (\u00b1)-anti-B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), N-nitroso-N-methylurea (methyl nitrosourea; MNU) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). FA (10-75\u03bcM) did not enhance the genotoxic and mutagenic activity of these mutagens under the test conditions applied. FA alone and in combination with MNU or MMS did not affect the expression (mRNA level) of the gene of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in A549 cells. The results of these experiments do not support the assumption that low FA concentrations might interfere with the repair of DNA damage induced by other mutagens.",

DNA effects were analysed in leukocytes using the alkaline Comet assay, gene mutations and chromosome aberrations were measured in erythrocytes using the flow cytometric Pig-a gene mutation assay and the micronucleus test (applying both microscopic and flow cytometric evaluation), respectively. Since nano-sized CeO<sub>2</sub> elicited lung effects at concentrations of 5mg/m<sup>3</sup> (burdens of 0.5mg/lung) in the preceding range-finding study, whereas nano-sized BaSO<sub>4</sub> did not induce any effect, female rats were exposed to aerosol concentrations of 0.1 up to 3mg/m<sup>3</sup> CeO<sub>2</sub> or 50mg/m<sup>3</sup> BaSO<sub>4</sub> nanomaterials (6h/day; 5 days/week; whole-body exposure).

A wide variety of mutagens have been shown to cause DNA alterations detectable with the comet assay, but it is not yet clear whether a relationship exists between the DNA effects and the induction of mutations. We are therefore investigating in a cell culture system with human cells (MRC5CV1) the induction of DNA damage by environmental mutagens and the formation of mutations at the HPRT gene. In the present study we investigated benzo[a]pyrene (BP), an environmental mutagenic and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and its reactive metabolite (+)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol 9, 10-oxide ((+)-anti-BPDE). S9 mix activated BP and the direct acting mutagen (+)-anti-BPDE caused a concentration-related increase in DNA migration in the comet assay. Postincubation experiments indicated that induced DNA effects are eliminated by DNA repair within 24 h. BP-treatment caused a strong genotoxic effect in the comet assay but had only a marginal effect on the frequency of gene mutations. When cells were treated with BP in the presence of cadmium sulphate, a clear increase in genotoxicity was observed while the effect on mutations was unchanged. Our results indicate that DNA alterations detected with the comet assay do not necessarily relate to mutagenesis. The absence of a close relationship between DNA migration in the comet assay and mutagenesis may be explained by the fact that some effects seen in the comet assay occur as a consequence of an error free DNA repair process.",

Mutation rates at an expanded simple tandem repeat DNA locus and a protein-coding gene (hprt) were significantly elevated in both the germline (sperm) and somatic tissues of all the offspring of irradiated males. The transgenerational changes in mutation rates were attributed to the presence of a persistent subset of endogenous DNA lesions (double- and single-strand breaks), measured by the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX) and alkaline Comet assays. Such remarkable transgenerational destabilization of the F(1) genome may have important implications for cancer aetiology and genetic risk estimates.

We investigated the distorting influence of endogenous, assay-inherent factors onto base (single cell level) and primary outcome measures (experimental/slide level), such as olive tail moment (OTM) and percentage DNA in the tail (%tail-DNA). From 2003 to 2008, we performed the assay on lymphocytes isolated from the blood samples of 355 lung cancer patients, 170 controls, and 610 relatives, as well as one single reference individual, repeated 170 times. In total, the data from 10,016 single experiments containing around 1,750,000 cells have been included in this study. This is the first time that the endogenous variability of the COMET assay has been validated systematically on such a huge data set over a 5 year period. Assuming that the reference sample reflects assay specific white noise, we estimated a proportion of 7-95% of the variability of the outcome measures due to assay variation (white noise) depending on parameter, exposure level, and study group. The proportion of white noise was largest for the initial radiation damage. The specific endogenous factors considered attribute to 14.8% of the total variability in the primary outcome measurements of the OTM and 6.9% of the %tail-DNA. OTM turns out to be a sensitive parameter to detect variation, but is also more susceptible to disturbance caused by endogenous factors than %tail-DNA. To reduce the experimental variability in COMET assays, we recommend a highly standardized operation protocol as well as inspecting and/or adjusting the primary outcome measures according to endogenous factors before calculating secondary outcome measures, e.g. DNA repair capacity (DRC) or testing statistical inference. A human reference (HR) sample is also useful to inspect homogeneity in the temporal progression of long lasting investigations, but not for calibrating primary outcome measurements.",

L5178Y cells were the most radiosensitive, while CHO-K1 cells and HMV-II cells were radioresistant. There was an inverse relationship between the survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) and the yield of initial DNA strand breaks per unit dose under the alkaline condition for the comet assay, and also a relationship between SF2 and the residual DNA strand breaks (for 4 hr after irradiation) under the neutral condition for the comet assay, the latter being generally considered to be relative to cellular radiosensitivity. In the present analysis, it was considered that the alkaline condition for the comet assay was optimal for evaluating the initial DNA strand breaks, while the neutral condition was optimal for evaluating the residual DNA strand breaks. Since the comet assay is simpler and more rapid than other methods for detecting radiation-induced DNA damage, this assay appears to be a useful predictive assay for evaluating cellular clonogenic radiosensitivity of tumor cells.",

In recent years, this assay has increasingly been recognized as a potentially valuable tool for regulatory studies. The assay commonly utilises commercially available software programmes to evaluate the extent of DNA damage at the single-cell level. These programmes provide a large number of measurement outcomes (i.e., tail length, %Tail DNA, various measures of tail moment, etc.) to evaluate the extent of DNA migration and DNA damage. At the moment, however, there is no general agreement with respect to the most relevant measurements or parameters to use. This study was carried out to establish which measurement(s) in the Comet assay are most significantly correlated with DNA damage, and should thus be adopted for routine use. Pooled peripheral blood samples from 3 healthy human individuals were irradiated with a range of doses of (137)Cs gamma-radiation (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 Gy). Following irradiation, the Comet assay was performed according to a standard protocol, and different parameters were recorded by use of Komet 5.0 software (Kinetic Imaging Ltd., Liverpool, UK). Following a correlation analysis, the Olive Tail Moment (OTM), the Tail Extent Moment and the percentage of DNA in the tail (%Tail DNA) gave good correlations that were not significantly different from each other. Further retrospective analysis from other in vitro and in vivo Comet assay experiments with chemical agents also suggested that OTM and %Tail DNA gave good correlation with the dose of genotoxic agents used. Since OTM and %Tail DNA are the most commonly used parameters in many manuscripts, these two could continue to be applied for routine use. However, since OTM is measured in arbitrary units and different image-analysis systems give different values, the %Tail DNA could be considered more meaningful and easy to conceptualise.

After a repair time of 3 h, following 2 Gy x-irradiation, some of the healthy volunteers showed no residual DNA damage at all in their lymphocytes, whereas others revealed about 30%. There was no indication that our results were affected by either age, gender or smoking habits. Slow repair kinetics and high amounts of residual damage were characteristic for many but not all tumour patients who had experienced severe side-effects in their normal tissues during or after radiotherapy (n = 18). Our conclusion is that those individuals showing poor DNA repair characteristics in the lymphocytes following in vitro irradiation, have a high probability of being radiosensitive. The opposite conclusion is not necessarily true: if repair is effective, this does not mean that the individual is radioresistant, because factors other than impaired repair may cause radiosensitivity.",

For this purpose, monoenergetic neutrons from Hiroshima University Radiobiological Research Accelerator (HIRRAC) were used to induce DNA damage in irradiated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The level of damage was computed as tail moment for different doses (0.125-1 Gy) and compared with the effects resulting from irradiation with (60)Co gamma. The neutron-irradiated cells exhibited longer comet tails consisting of tiny pieces of broken DNA in contrast to the streaking tails generated by (60)Co gamma. The peak biological effectiveness occurred at 0.37 and 0.57 MeV; a further increase or decrease in neutron energy led to a reduced RBE value. The RBE values, as measured by the comet assay, were 6.3, 5.4, 4.7, 4.3, 2.6, and 1.7 for 0.37, 0.57, 0.79, 0.186, 1, and 2.3 MeV neutrons. The lower RBE value obtained by the comet assay when compared to that for other biological end points is discussed. This study reports the usefulness of the alkaline comet assay for identifying DNA damage induced by neutrons of the same radiation weighting factor. The comet assay is a potential tool for use in neutron therapy, as well as a method for the rapid screening of samples from individuals accidentally exposed to radiation.",

The standard alkaline method of the comet assay involves deproteinization of cells embedded in agarose gel using a high salt-detergent lysis buffer, followed by denaturation of DNA and electrophoresis using a strong alkali at pH&gt;13 [N.P. Singh, M.T. McCoy, R.R. Tice, E.L. Schneider, A simple technique for quantitation of low levels of DNA damage in individual cells, Exp. Cell. Res. 175 (1988) 184-191]. However, a recent report showed that a strong alkali treatment results in simultaneous deproteinization of cells and denaturation of genomic DNA [P. Sestili, C. Martinelli, V. Stocchi, The fast halo assay: an improved method to quantify genomic DNA strand breakage at the single cell-level, Mutat. Res. 607 (2006) 205-214]. This study was carried out to test whether the strong alkali deproteinization of cells could replace the high salt-detergent lysis step used in the standard method of the alkaline comet assay. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 3 healthy individuals were irradiated with gamma rays at doses varying between 0 and 10 Gy. Following irradiation, the comet assay was performed according to the standard alkaline method (pH&gt;13) and a modified method. In the modified method, agarose embedded cells were treated with a strong alkali (0.3M NaOH, 0.02 M Trizma and 1mM EDTA, pH&gt;13) for 20 min to allow deproteinization of cells and denaturation of DNA. This was followed by electrophoresis using the same alkali solution to obtain comets. DNA damage expressed in terms of comet tail length, percentage of DNA in comet tail and tail moment obtained by the standard alkaline method and the modified method were compared. In both methods, DNA damage showed a good correlation with the dose of gamma ray. The results indicate a satisfactory sensitivity of the modified method in detecting radiation-induced DNA damage in human peripheral blood lymphocytes.",

Our previous results indicated that LCL with a BRCA1 mutation do not generally show the same chromosomal mutagen sensitivity in the micronucleus test as lymphocytes with the same BRCA1 mutation. To further study the radiosensitivity of LCL with a BRCA1 mutation, we now performed comparative investigations with the alkaline (pH 13) and the neutral (pH 8.3) comet assay and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). These tests are commonly used to determine the repair capacity for DNA double strand breaks (DNA-DSB). Six LCL (three established from women with a heterozygous BRCA1 mutation and three from healthy controls) were investigated. Induction (2 and 5 Gy) of gamma-ray-induced DNA damage and its repair (during 60 min after irradiation) was measured with the alkaline and neutral comet assay. Comparative experiments were performed with PFGE determining the induction of DNA-DSB by 10-50 Gy gamma-irradiation and their repair during 6 h. There was no significant difference between LCL with and without BRCA1 mutation in any of these experiments. Therefore, using these methods, no indication for a delayed repair of DNA-DSB in LCL with a BRCA1 mutation was found. However, these results do not generally exclude DNA-DSB repair deficiency in these cell lines because the methods applied have limited sensitivity and only measure the speed but not the fidelity of the repair process.",

To provide further data on the possible applicability of this assay in human biomonitoring studies, we have evaluated the eventual genetic damage induced by therapeutic exposure to 131I, by measuring the Comet length and the amount of DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes from a group of 28 thyroid cancer patients who received 131I sodium iodide via oral administration. Blood samples were taken just before the treatment and 1 week after it. From the results obtained after radioiodine therapy, a small increase in the Comet length and in the grade of DNA damage is observed; however, this increase is not statistically significant because of inter-individual variability and the variable responses before and after 131I treatment. Considering our previous studies showing significant increases in the frequency of cytogenetic damage (when measured as micronuclei) in patients treated with relatively low doses of 131I, the results obtained in the present work by using the Comet assay could indicate that 1 week after the exposure most of the radioiodine-induced DNA lesions, that can be detected with this assay, have already been repaired.",

As structural changes in chromosomes frequently lead to activation of proto-oncogenes and elimination of tumor-suppressor genes, they represent important mechanisms for the initiation of DNA repair processes and tumorigenesis. With the exception of rare genetic syndromes such as AT (Ataxia telangiectasia) or NBS (Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome), the background for the inheritance of genetic susceptibility to radiation is unknown. Recently, a large-scale genetic screen of mouse mutants has been established within the German Human Genome Project (Hrab\u00e8 de Angelis and Balling 1998). The goal of this ENU (ENU: ethylnitrosourea) mutagenesis screen is the generation of mutant mice that will serve as animal models for human diseases and genetic susceptibility. In order to fully utilize the potential of a genetic screen of this magnitude, in which exploration for genes responsible for genomic instability and radiation sensitivity is to occur, it is necessary to establish a simple assay system that is amenable to automation. Hence, we are using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) to detect mouse mutants that display a genetic susceptibility to ionizing radiation. We have established the analysis parameters in the comet assay which are currently used to detect radiation-sensitive mouse mutants and to control the variance within the mouse population in the ENU screen. The assay can be used to isolate genes that are responsible for DNA repair and radiation sensitivity in mouse and human.",

The functions and mechanisms behind such reorganization, however, are unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor GRHL2 is necessary and sufficient to activate an epithelial subset of enhancers as naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) transition into formative epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Surprisingly, many GRHL2 target genes do not change in expression during the ESC-EpiLC transition. Instead, enhancers regulating these genes in ESCs diminish in activity in EpiLCs while GRHL2-dependent alternative enhancers become activated to maintain transcription. GRHL2 therefore assumes control over a subset of the naive network via enhancer switching to maintain expression of epithelial genes upon exit from naive pluripotency. These data evoke a model where the naive pluripotency network becomes partitioned into smaller, independent networks regulated by EpiLC-specific transcription factors, thereby priming cells for lineage specification.",

They possess a unique developmental plasticity, termed naive pluripotency. For development to proceed, this naive state must be subsumed by multi-lineage differentiation within 72 h following implantation. In vitro differentiation of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in controlled conditions provides a tractable system to dissect and understand the process of exit from naive pluripotency and entry into lineage specification. Exploitation of this system in recent large-scale RNAi and mutagenesis screens has uncovered multiple new factors and modules that drive or facilitate progression out of the naive state. Notably, these studies show that the transcription factor network that governs the naive state is rapidly dismantled prior to upregulation of lineage specification markers, creating an intermediate state that we term formative pluripotency. Here, we summarize these findings and propose a road map for state transitions in ESC differentiation that reflects the orderly dynamics of epiblast progression in the embryo.",

Two phases of pluripotency, called na\u00efve and primed, have previously been described. In this Hypothesis article, a third phase, called formative pluripotency, is proposed to exist as part of a developmental continuum between the na\u00efve and primed phases.

Due to the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification, and diverse subcellular localization of proteins, few versatile tools are available for effective identification and visualization of protein motifs. In addition, various reduced AA alphabets based on physicochemical, structural, or functional properties have been valuable in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution. However, there is lack of tools for applying reduced AA alphabets to the identification and visualization of statistically significant motifs. To fill this gap, we developed an R/Bioconductor package dagLogo, which has several advantages over existing tools. First, dagLogo allows various formats for input sets and provides comprehensive options to build optimal background models. It implements different reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties. Furthermore, dagLogo provides statistical and visual solutions for differential AA (or AA group) usage analysis of both large and small data sets. Case studies showed that dagLogo can better identify and visualize conserved protein sequence patterns from different types of inputs and can potentially reveal the biological patterns that could be missed by other logo generators.",

Targeting aberrant cell survival pathways with selective small molecule BH3-mimetic inhibitors of BCL-2 (venetoclax, S55746), BCL-XL (A1331852), or MCL1 (S63845) is an emerging therapeutic option. We report that combined targeting of BCL-2 and MCL1 is synergistic in B-ALL in vitro. The combination demonstrated greater efficacy than standard chemotherapeutics and TKIs in primary samples from adult B-ALL with Ph+ ALL, Ph-like ALL, and other B-ALL. Moreover, combined BCL-2 or MCL1 inhibition with dasatinib showed potent killing in primary Ph+ B-ALL cases, but the BH3-mimetic combination appeared superior in vitro in a variety of Ph-like ALL samples. In PDX models, combined BCL-2 and MCL1 targeting eradicated ALL from Ph- and Ph+ B-ALL cases, although fatal tumor lysis was observed in some instances of high tumor burden.

Analysis of PEPCK structures have revealed amino acid residues involved in substrate/cofactor coordination during catalysis. Key residues involved in coordinating the different substrates and cofactor bound to E. coli PEPCK were mutated. Purified mutant enzymes were used for kinetic assays. The structure of some mutant enzymes were determined using X-ray crystallography. Mutation of residues D269 and H232, which comprise part of the coordination sphere of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, reduced k<sub>cat</sub> by 14-fold, and significantly increased the K<sub>m</sub> values for Mn<sup>2+</sup> and OAA. Mutation of K254 a key residue in the P-loop motif that interacts with MgATP, significantly elevated the K<sub>m</sub> value for MgATP and reduced k<sub>cat</sub>.

Initially described as being mainly produced in muscle during physical exercise, irisin mediates adipose tissue thermogenesis and also regulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hepatic expression of FNDC5 and its role in hepatocytes in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL). Here we report that hepatic expression of FNDC5 increased with hepatic steatosis and liver injury without impacting the systemic level of irisin in mouse models of NAFLD (HFD and MCDD) and in obese patients. The increased Fndc5 expression in fatty liver resulted from its upregulation in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells in mice. The local production of Fndc5 in hepatocytes was influenced by genotoxic stress and p53-dependent pathways. The down-regulation of FNDC5 in human HepG2 cells and in primary mouse hepatocytes increased the expression of PEPCK, a key enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis associated with a decrease in the expression of master genes involved in the VLDL synthesis (CIDEB and APOB). These alterations in FNDC5-silenced cells resulted to increased steatosis and insulin resistance in response to oleic acid and N-acetyl glucosamine, respectively. The downregulation of Fndc5 also sensitized primary hepatocytes to apoptosis in response to TNF\u03b1, which has been associated with decreased hepatoprotective autophagic flux. In conclusion, our human and experimental data strongly suggest that the hepatic expression of FNDC5 increased with hepatic steatosis and its upregulation in hepatocytes could dampen the development of NAFLD by negatively regulating steatogenesis and hepatocyte death.",

A recent report confirms that Pck1 is a target for proteasomal degradation through its proline residue at the penultimate position, recognized by Gid4 E3 ligase, but with a lack of informative structural details. In this study, we delineate the localized sequence motif, degron, that specifically interact with Gid4 ligase and unravel the binding mode of Pck1 to the Gid4 ligase by using molecular docking and molecular dynamics. The peptide/protein docking HPEPDOCK web server along with molecular dynamic simulations are applied to demonstrate the binding mode and interactions of a Pck1 wild type (SPSK) and mutant (K4V) with the recently solved structure of Gid4 ligase. Results unveil a distinct binding mode of the mutated peptide compared with the wild type despite having comparable binding affinities to Gid4. Moreover, the four-residue peptide is found insufficient for Gid4 binding, while the seven-residue peptide suffices for binding to Gid4. The amino acids S134, K135, and N137 in the loop L1 (between \u03b21 and \u03b22) of the Gid4 are essential for the stabilization of the seven-residue peptide in the binding site of the ligase. The presence of Val<sup>4</sup> instead of Lys<sup>4</sup> smashes the H-bonds that are formed between Lys<sup>4</sup> and Gid4 in the wild type peptide, making the peptide prone to bind with the other side of the binding pocket (L4 loop of Gid4). The dynamics of Gid4 L3 loop is affected dramatically once K4V mutant Pck1 peptide is introduced. This opens the door to explore the mutation effects on the binding mode and smooth the path to target protein degradation by design competitive and non-competitive inhibitors.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698624": "<b>Background:</b> The scratch collapse test (SCT) is a clinical examination maneuver that has been previously reported as a reliable and reproducible test to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The initial study by Cheng et al in 2008 showed a simple test with high sensitivity. However, subsequent attempts to reproduce those findings have resulted in lower accuracy. Our goal was to evaluate the use of the SCT for patients presenting with symptoms of pain, numbness, or weakness in an upper extremity. <b>Methods:</b> Forty patients were referred to the electrodiagnostic (EDX) lab for evaluation of an upper extremity. One blinded examiner who was familiar with the maneuver performed the SCT on all 40 patients. Another physician or technician performed the nerve conduction study and electromyography. Patient history and accompanying physical examination findings were not revealed to the SCT examiner. <b>Results:</b> The relationship between the SCT performed by a blinded examiner and the EDX performed by blinded examiners was nonsignificant (<i>P</i> = .676) and showed a sensitivity of 0.48, specificity of 0.59, positive predictive value of 0.61, and negative predictive value of 0.45. <b>Conclusion:</b> Based on this study and previous findings by other authors, we would advise against the use of the SCT in CTS for important patient-care decisions, such as surgical decision-making, until future research is done. It is possible that the SCT, in combination with other physical examination maneuvers, could increase diagnostic accuracy and enhance patient management.",

Appropriate and timely evaluation, diagnosis, objective testing, and evidence-based decisions regarding treatment options are paramount in the optimal care of the patient with this pathology. An understanding of current literature is critical in determining and understanding best practices. A thorough review of the recent literature regarding physical examination, diagnostic testing, and nonoperative versus operative results was performed. Regarding physical examination, the glenohumeral internal rotation test and scratch collapse test are more effective and sensitive than traditional maneuvers such as Tinel's testing and the elbow flexion test. Electrodiagnostic testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound evaluation have all been shown to be effective in diagnosing cubital tunnel syndrome. However, no single test has proven itself to be superior. Nonoperative treatment can be successful for mild cases of cubital tunnel syndrome. Surgical release techniques comparing open with endoscopic release are equivocal, and in situ release versus transposition techniques show that transposition should not be performed routinely. The diagnosis and treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome do not have a well-defined algorithm based on current literature. The treating physician must therefore utilize the available information to determine a diagnostic and treatment plan individualized to the patient. More rigorous scientific studies are needed to determine the most effective surgical approaches for cubital tunnel syndrome.",

Ninety-two subjects were recruited from all patients referred for electrodiagnostic studies for upper extremity symptoms that were thought to be related to an entrapment mononeuropathy. The scratch collapse test was performed twice on each patient, once by the resident and once by a nerve conduction technician. Both observers were blinded to all aspects of the patient's presentation. Sensitivity and specificity for the scratch collapse test were calculated twice, once using electrodiagnostic testing results and a second time using a validated clinical tool (the CTS-6) as the reference standard. The interrater reliability was also calculated. Using electrodiagnostic criteria as a reference standard, the scratch collapse test had a sensitivity of 7% and a specificity of 78% for CTS. Using clinical criteria as a reference standard, the test had a sensitivity of 15% and a specificity of 87%. For cubital tunnel syndrome, the sensitivity was 10% and the specificity was 90%. For the resident/technician 1, kappa was -0.025 (worse than chance alone). For the resident/technician 2, kappa was 0.211 (fair strength of agreement). The sensitivity of the scratch collapse test for CTS and cubital tunnel syndrome was lower than that found in other studies, regardless of whether a clinical or an electrodiagnostic reference standard was used. The specificity was high. Overall interrater agreement was lower than previously reported.

The scratch collapse test was prospectively compared with Tinel's sign and flexion/nerve compression in 169 patients and 109 controls. One hundred nineteen patients were diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and 70 patients were diagnosed with cubital tunnel syndrome based on history, examination, and positive electrodiagnostic test. For the new test, the patient resisted bilateral shoulder external rotation with elbows flexed. The area of suspected nerve compression was lightly \"scratched,\" and then resisted shoulder external rotation was immediately repeated. Momentary loss of shoulder external rotation resistance on the affected side was considered a positive test. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated. For carpal tunnel syndrome, sensitivities were 64%, 32%, and 44% for the scratch collapse test, Tinel's test, and wrist flexion/compression test, respectively. For cubital tunnel syndrome, sensitivities were 69%, 54%, and 46% for the scratch collapse test, Tinel test, and elbow flexion/compression test, respectively. The scratch collapse test had the highest negative predictive value (73%) for carpal tunnel syndrome. Tinel's test had the highest negative predictive value (98%) for cubital tunnel syndrome. Specificity and positive predictive values were high for all of the tests. The scratch collapse test had significantly higher sensitivity than Tinel's test and the flexion/nerve compression test for carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes. Accuracy for this test was 82% for carpal tunnel syndrome and 89% for cubital tunnel syndrome. This novel test provides a useful addition to existing clinical maneuvers in the diagnosis of these common nerve compression syndromes. Diagnostic II.",

From January 1, 2004 to December 1, 2005, 64 adult patients with cubital tunnel syndrome were evaluated by a single surgeon. Cubital tunnel syndrome was diagnosed based upon symptoms of numbness, tingling, and/or pain in the ulnar nerve distribution or by the presence of weakness or wasting of the ulnar-innervated intrinsic hand muscles. All diagnoses were confirmed with electrodiagnostic studies. As part of the physical examination, the SCT was performed along three subdivided segments in the region of the cubital tunnel. Results of the SCT were recorded and correlated with intraoperative findings. Of the 64 patients evaluated, 44 had a positive SCT that was either more profound or solely present a few centimeters distal to the medial epicondyle in the region of Osborne's band. All of these patients subsequently underwent anterior submuscular transposition and were found to have a tight compression point at Osborne's band corresponding to their preoperative SCT. This study suggests that the scratch collapse test may be a reliable physical examination technique for localizing the point of maximal nerve compression in patients with cubital tunnel syndrome.

The scratch collapse test (SCT) is a novel test that may be of diagnostic advantage. The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the SCT for CTS. A literature search was performed using PubMed (1966 to April 2018); Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to April 2018); EMBASE (1988 to April 2018); and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, to April 2018). We examined the studies for the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of the SCT. This review has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018077115). The literature search generated 13 unique articles. Seven articles were included for full text screening and 3 articles met our inclusion criteria, all of which were level II evidence with low risk of bias (165 patients). Pooled sensitivities, specificities, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratios were 0.32 [95% CI (0.24-0.41)], 0.62 [95% CI (0.45-0.78)], 0.75 [95% CI (0.33-1.67)], and 1.03 [95% CI (0.61-1.74)], respectively. The calculated area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (AUSROC) curve was 0.25, indicating a low diagnostic accuracy.

This study aims to perform a systematic review of literature to assess the data on the reliability of the SCT as a diagnostic test for entrapment neuropathy. Ten articles were reviewed. Five articles had sufficient numerical data for analysis, and in these five articles, the positive predictive values and specificity were high, i.e. between 0.71 and 0.99 and 0.6 and 0.99, respectively, whereas other values were very variable, i.e. individual negative predictive values ranged from 0.15 to 0.92 and the sensitivity values ranged from 0.24 to 0.77. Another main finding was the versatility of the test in that it can be used for various nerve entrapments and to localise the exact level of compression. Literature suggests that SCT has potential to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool for entrapment neuropathy.

The purpose of this study is to introduce the hierarchical SCT as a physical examination tool for identifying multilevel nerve compression in patients with cubital tunnel syndrome. A prospective cohort study (2010-2011) was conducted of patients referred with primary cubital tunnel syndrome. Five ulnar nerve compression sites were evaluated with the SCT. Each site generating a positive SCT was sequentially \"frozen out\" with a topical anesthetic to allow determination of both primary and secondary ulnar nerve entrapment points. The order or \"hierarchy\" of compression sites was recorded. Twenty-five patients (mean age 49.6 \u00b1 12.3 years; 64 % female) were eligible for inclusion. The primary entrapment point was identified as Osborne's band in 80 % and the cubital tunnel retinaculum in 20 % of patients. Secondary entrapment points were also identified in the following order in all patients: (1) volar antebrachial fascia, (2) Guyon's canal, and (3) arcade of Struthers. The SCT is useful in localizing the site of primary compression of the ulnar nerve in patients with cubital tunnel syndrome. It is also sensitive enough to detect secondary compression points when primary sites are sequentially frozen out with a topical anesthetic, termed the hierarchical SCT.

IFNAR1 surface expression and internalisation on human monocytes before and after exposure to anifrolumab were assessed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The effects of anifrolumab on type I IFN pathway activation were assessed using signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation, IFN-stimulated response element-luciferase reporter cell assays and type I IFN gene signature induction. The ability of anifrolumab to inhibit plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) function and plasma cell differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry and ELISA. Effector-null properties of anifrolumab were assessed in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays with B cells. Anifrolumab reduced cell surface IFNAR1 by eliciting IFNAR1 internalisation. Anifrolumab blocked type I IFN-dependent STAT1 phosphorylation and IFN-dependent signalling induced by recombinant and pDC-derived type I IFNs and serum of patients with SLE. Anifrolumab suppressed type I IFN production by blocking the type I IFN autoamplification loop and inhibited proinflammatory cytokine induction and the upregulation of costimulatory molecules on stimulated pDCs. Blockade of IFNAR1 suppressed plasma cell differentiation in pDC/B cell co-cultures. Anifrolumab did not exhibit CDC or ADCC activity.

In this study, we report the presence of IFN activation in SLE bone marrow (BM), as measured by an IFN gene signature, increased IFN regulated chemokines, and direct production of IFN by BM-resident cells, associated with profound changes in B cell development. The majority of SLE patients had an IFN signature in the BM that was more pronounced than the paired peripheral blood and correlated with both higher autoantibodies and disease activity. Pronounced alterations in B cell development were noted in SLE in the presence of an IFN signature with a reduction in the fraction of pro/pre-B cells, suggesting an inhibition in early B cell development and an expansion of B cells at the transitional stage. These B cell changes strongly correlated with an increase in BAFF and APRIL expression in the IFN-high BM. Furthermore, we found that BM neutrophils in SLE were prime producers of IFN-\u03b1 and B cell factors. In NZM lupus-prone mice, similar changes in B cell development were observed and mediated by IFN, given abrogation in NZM mice lacking type-I IFNR. BM neutrophils were abundant, responsive to, and producers of IFN, in close proximity to B cells.

The primary objectives of this analysis were (a) to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for sifalimumab in SLE; (b) to identify and quantitate the impact of patient/disease characteristics on pharmacokinetic variability; and (c) to evaluate fixed versus body weight (WT)-based dosing regimens. Sifalimumab serum concentration-time data were collected from a phase Ib study (MI-CP152) designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sifalimumab in adult patients with SLE. Sifalimumab was administered every 14 days as a 30- to 60-minute intravenous infusion with escalating doses of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg and serum concentrations were collected over 350 days. A total of 120 patients provided evaluable pharmacokinetic data with a total of 2,370 serum concentrations. Sifalimumab serum concentrations were determined using a validated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a lower limit of quantitation of 1.25 \u03bcg/mL. Population pharmacokinetic modeling of sifalimumab was performed using a non-linear mixed effects modeling approach with NONMEM VII software. Impact of patient demographics, clinical indices, and biomarkers on pharmacokinetic parameters were explored using a stepwise forward selection and backward elimination approach. The appropriateness of the final model was tested using visual predictive check (VPC). The impact of body WT-based and fixed dosing of sifalimumab was evaluated using a simulation approach. The final population model was utilized for phase IIb dosing projections. Sifalimumab pharmacokinetics were best described using a two-compartment linear model with first order elimination. Following intravenous dosing, the typical clearance (CL) and central volume of distribution (V 1) were estimated to be 176 mL/day and 2.9 L, respectively. The estimates (coefficient of variation) of between-subject variability for CL and V 1 were 28 and 31 %, respectively. Patient baseline body WT, interferon gene signature from 21 genes, steroid use, and sifalimumab dose were identified as significant covariates for CL, whereas only baseline body WT was a significant covariate for V 1 and peripheral volume of distribution (V 2). Although the above-mentioned covariates were statistically significant, they did not explain variability in pharmacokinetic parameters to any relevant extent (&lt;7 %). Thus, no dosing adjustments are necessary. VPC confirmed good predictability of the final population pharmacokinetic model. Simulation results demonstrate that both fixed and body WT-based dosing regimens yield similar median steady state concentrations and overall variability. Fixed sifalimumab doses of 200, 600, and 1,200 mg monthly (with a loading dose at Day 14) were selected for a phase IIb clinical trial.

Only one drug, belimumab, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat SLE during the last 50 years and there remains a high unmet medical need to develop new and effective therapies to benefit different patient populations in SLE. Due to the extreme heterogeneity of the disease and the complex and rigorous process to validate individual biomarkers, there is currently a very limited number of consensus biomarkers to aid the treatment decision-making in SLE. This review provides a snapshot of some biomarkers in the field that have the potential to make a big impact on drug development and/or treatment decisions by physicians. These include: type I interferon (IFN) gene signature as a pharmacodynamic marker and potential predictive marker for anti-type I IFN therapy; anti-double stranded DNA as a disease marker and potential predictive marker for flares; the complements and neutrophil signatures as disease marker of SLE; and TWEAK (a tumor necrosis factor family member produced by macrophages) and MCP-1 as potential markers to predict renal flares. Most of these markers need carefully planned and prospective studies with high statistical power to confirm their respective utilities. With the development and application of powerful new technologies, more successful biomarkers will emerge in SLE. This could improve the management of patients in the clinic and facilitate the development of novel and more effective therapeutics for this difficult-to-treat disease.",

The molecular characteristics and nature of circulating PC and B cells in SLE have not been completely characterized. Microarray analysis of gene expression was used to characterize circulating PC in subjects with active SLE. Flow cytometry was used to sort PC and comparator B cell populations from active SLE blood, normal blood and normal tonsil. The gene expression profiles of the sorted B cell populations were then compared. SLE PC exhibited a similar gene expression signature as tonsil PC. The differences in gene expression between SLE PC and normal tonsil PC and tonsil plasmablasts (PB) suggest a mature Ig secreting cell phenotype in the former population. Despite this, SLE PC differed in expression of about half the genes from previously published gene expression profiles of normal bone marrow PC, indicating that these cells had not achieved a fully mature status. Abnormal expression of several genes, including CXCR4 and S1P(1), suggests a mechanism for the persistence of SLE PC in the circulation. All SLE B cell populations revealed an interferon (IFN) gene signature previously only reported in unseparated SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These data indicate that SLE PC are a unique population of Ig secreting cells with a gene expression profile indicative of a mature, but not fully differentiated phenotype.",

Overexpressed transcripts were identified in the whole blood (WB) of 262 patients with SLE, 44 with DM, 33 with PM, 28 with SSc and 89 with RA and compared with 24 healthy subjects using Affymetrix microarrays. A five gene type I IFN signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type I IFN pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this pathway in the WB with clinical measurements. A common set of 36 type I IFN inducible transcripts were identified among the most overexpressed in the WB of all subjects. Significant activation of the type I IFN pathway in subgroups of each of the five diseases studied was observed. Baseline disease activity measurements correlated with a type I IFN gene signature in the WB of subjects with SLE, PM and SSc, as did various serum autoantibody levels in subjects with SLE and DM. This signature was also well correlated between disease-affected tissue and WB in subjects with SLE, DM, PM and SSc. The results indicate that the type I IFN pathway is activated in patient subsets of five rheumatic diseases and suggest that these subsets may benefit from anti-IFN therapy.",

We used microarray to probe the platelet transcriptome in patients with SLE and healthy controls, and the gene and protein expression of a subset of differentially expressed genes was further investigated and correlated to platelet activation status. Real-time PCR was used to confirm a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature in patients with SLE, and the IFN-regulated proteins PRKRA, IFITM1 and CD69 (P &lt; .0001) were found to be up-regulated in platelets from SLE patients compared with healthy volunteers. Notably, patients with a history of vascular disease had increased expression of type I IFN-regulated proteins as well as more activated platelets compared with patients without vascular disease. We suggest that interferogenic immune complexes stimulate production of IFN\u03b1 that up-regulates the megakaryocytic type I IFN-regulated genes and proteins. This could affect platelet activation and contribute to development of vascular disease in SLE. In addition, platelets with type I IFN signature could be a novel marker for vascular disease in SLE.",

This phase Ia trial was undertaken to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of anti-IFNalpha monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy in SLE. During the trial, we also examined whether overexpression of an IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signature in whole blood could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to evaluate IFNalpha neutralization and investigated downstream effects of neutralizing IFNalpha on BAFF and other key signaling pathways, i.e., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and IL-1beta, in SLE. Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used to profile whole blood and lesional skin of patients receiving standard therapy for mild to moderate SLE. Selected IFNalpha/beta-inducible proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. With the study treatment, we observed anti-IFNalpha mAb-specific and dose-dependent inhibition of overexpression of IFNalpha/beta-inducible genes in whole blood and skin lesions from SLE patients, at both the transcript and the protein levels. In SLE patients with overexpression of messenger RNA for BAFF, TNFalpha, IL-10, IL-1beta, GM-CSF, and their respective inducible gene signatures in whole blood and/or skin lesions, we observed a general trend toward suppression of the expression of these genes and/or gene signatures upon treatment with anti-IFNalpha mAb. IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signatures in whole blood are effective pharmacodynamic biomarkers to evaluate anti-IFNalpha mAb therapy in SLE. Anti-IFNalpha mAb can neutralize overexpression of IFNalpha/beta-inducible genes in whole blood and lesional skin from SLE patients and has profound effects on signaling pathways that may be downstream of IFNalpha in SLE.",

A characteristic feature of this disease is the occurrence of antibodies against nuclear antigens. Further, SLE is characterized by a type-I interferon gene signature. A dysregulation of apoptosis and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is discussed as a central pathogenetic mechanism in the development of SLE. Several publications in recent years have described an accumulation of autoantigens within apoptotic cells, as well as an exposition of these antigens on the surface of apoptotic cells. During late stages of apoptosis, autoantigens are posttranslationally modified, leading to the formation of neoantigens. Subcellular fragments such as apoptotic microparticles also seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. It has been shown that microparticles contain relevant antigens and stimulate B- and T-lymphocytes. Moreover, apoptotic microparticles have the ability to stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells, causing a secretion of interferon alpha. These observations provide a link between dysregulation of apoptosis and phagocytosis and the type-I interferon signature observed in SLE patients.",

Serum levels of IFN-alpha are elevated in SLE patients, and gene expression profiling of peripheral blood cells shows that most lupus cases demonstrate an upregulation of IFN-responsive genes. Of interest, the IFN gene 'signature' correlates with more severe disease. The available data support a model whereby chromatin-containing immune complexes circulating in the blood of lupus patients stimulate leukocytes to produce IFN, which perpetuates disease. These emerging insights into the connection between IFN and lupus provide a host of new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.",

A bioinformatic approach employing individual IFN species gene signatures to interrogate SLE microarray datasets demonstrates a putative role for numerous IFN species, with prominent expression of IFNB1 and IFNW signatures. In contrast with other SLE-affected organs, the IGS is less prominent in lupus nephritis. SLE patients with active and inactive disease have readily detectable IGS and the IGS changes synchronously with a monocyte signature but not disease activity, and is significantly related to monocyte transcripts. Monocyte over-expression of three times as many IGS transcripts as T and B cells and IGS retention in monocytes, but not T and B cells from inactive SLE patients contribute to the lack of correlation between the IGS and SLE disease activity.",

However, the expression of this gene signature in individuals with incomplete forms of lupus and the pathogenic relationship between IFN signature genes and autoantibody production have not been explored fully. In the present study, we examined the gene expression and autoantibody profiles of patients diagnosed with incomplete lupus erythematosus (ILE) to determine correlations of the gene expression signature with autoantibody production. Gene expression analysis was carried out on the 24K Illumina Human Refseq-8 arrays using blood samples from 84 subjects, including patients with SLE (n = 27) or ILE (n = 24), first-degree relatives (FDR) of these patients (n = 22) and non-autoimmune control (NC) individuals (n = 11). Autoantibody expression was measured using standard immunoassays and autoantigen proteomic arrays. Up-regulation of a set of 63 IFN signature genes was seen in 83% of SLE patients and 50% of ILE patients. High levels of IFN gene expression in ILE and SLE showed significant correlations with the expression of a subset of IgG autoantibodies, including chromatin, dsDNA, dsRNA, U1snRNP, Ro/SSA, La/SSB, topoisomerase I and Scl 70, while low IFN levels were correlated with immunoglobulin (Ig)M autoreactivity. These studies suggest that in patients with ILE the IFN gene expression signature may identify a subset of these individuals who are at risk for disease progression. Furthermore, high levels of alpha IFN may promote autoantibody class-switch from IgM to the more pathogenic IgG class.",

Quantification of the IFN signature is currently performed by gene expression analysis, limiting its current applicability in clinical practice. Therefore, the objective of this study was to establish an easy to measure biomarker for the IFN signature. Serum levels of galectin-9, CXCL-10 (IP-10) and tumour necrosis factor receptor type II (TNF-RII) were measured in patients with SLE, SLE+APS and primary APS (PAPS) and healthy controls (n=148) after an initial screening of serum analytes in a smaller cohort (n=43). Analytes were correlated to measures of disease activity and the IFN signature. The performance of galectin-9, CXCL-10 and TNF-RII as biomarkers to detect the IFN signature was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves. Galectin-9, CXCL-10 and TNF-RII were elevated in patients with SLE, SLE+APS and PAPS (p&lt;0.05) and correlated with disease activity and tissue factor expression. Galectin-9 correlated stronger than CXCL-10 or TNF-RII with the IFN score (r=0.70, p&lt;0.001) and was superior to CXCL-10 or TNF-RII in detecting the IFN signature (area under the curve (AUC) 0.86). Importantly, in patients with SLE(\u00b1APS), galectin-9 was also superior to anti-dsDNA antibody (AUC 0.70), or complement C3 (AUC 0.70) and C4 (AUC 0.78) levels in detecting the IFN signature. Galectin-9 is a novel, easy to measure hence clinically applicable biomarker to detect the IFN signature in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE and APS.",

Peripheral blood was obtained from 10 healthy controls and 30 patients with CLE, including eight with concomitant SLE. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into complementary DNA. Gene expression levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH, standardized to healthy controls and then summed to calculate an IFN score for each patient. Disease activity was assessed with the Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index (CLASI). Patients with subacute CLE (SCLE) and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) had elevated IFN scores compared with healthy controls regardless of concomitant SLE (P &lt; 0\u00b701 with SLE and P &lt; 0\u00b705 without SLE). There was no difference between patients with tumid lupus erythematosus (TLE) and healthy controls. The IFN score correlated with CLASI scores (Spearman's rho = 0\u00b755, P = 0\u00b70017). Patients with SCLE and DLE have an IFN signature, as seen in SLE. The level of gene expression correlates with cutaneous disease activity.

We developed a method to quantify the IS using three genes-the IS metric (ISM)-and characterised the clinical characteristics of patients with SLE with different ISM status from multiple clinical trials. Blood microarray expression data from a training cohort of patients with SLE confirmed the presence of the IS and identified surrogate genes. We assayed these genes in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, yielding an ISM from the IS. The association of ISM status with clinical disease characteristics was assessed in patients with extrarenal lupus and lupus nephritis from four clinical trials. Three genes, HERC5, EPSTI and CMPK2, correlated well with the IS (p&gt;0.96), and composed the ISM qPCR assay. Using the 95th centile for healthy control data, patients with SLE from different studies were classified into two ISM subsets-ISM-Low and ISM-High-that are longitudinally stable over 36 weeks. Significant associations were identified between ISM-High status and higher titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies, presence of anti extractable nuclear antigen autoantibodies, elevated serum B cell activating factor of the tumour necrosis factor family (BAFF) levels, and hypocomplementaemia. However, measures of overall clinical disease activity were similar for ISM-High and ISM-Low groups. The ISM is an IS biomarker that divides patients with SLE into two subpopulations-ISM-High and ISM-Low-with differing serological manifestations.

As CCR6 enriches for Th17 cells, we used this approach to investigate whether CCR6\u207a memory T-helper cells producing IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and/or IL-22 are increased in SLE patients and whether this increase is related to the presence of IFN type I signature.

In addition, several cells in the immune system promote the IFN production by pDCs and gene variants in the type I IFN signaling pathway contribute to the IFN signature. The type I IFNs act as an immune adjuvant and stimulate T cells, B cells, and monocytes, which all play an important role in the loss of tolerance and persistent autoimmune reaction in SLE.

Pharmacodynamically induced changes in gene expression following tabalumab treatment were extensive, occurring predominantly in B cell-related and immunoglobulin genes, and were consistent with other pharmacodynamic changes including anti-dsDNA antibody, C3, and immunoglobulin levels. SLE patients demonstrated increased expression of an IFN response gene signature (75% of patients had an elevated IFN response gene signature) at baseline in ILLUMINATE-1 and ILLUMINATE-2.

However, type I IFN, mainly IFNalpha, plays a major role in activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multi-systemic, inflammatory autoimmune disease with undefined etiology. SLE is characterized by dysregulation of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems. An increased expression of type I IFN-regulated genes, termed IFN signature, has been reported in patients with SLE. We review here the role of IFNalpha in the pathogenesis and course of SLE and the possible role of IFNalpha inhibition as a novel treatment for lupus patients.",

Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we now show that active SLE can be distinguished by a remarkably homogeneous gene expression pattern with overexpression of granulopoiesis-related and interferon (IFN)-induced genes. Using the most stringent statistical analysis (Bonferroni correction), 15 genes were found highly up-regulated in SLE patients, 14 of which are targets of IFN and one, defensin DEFA-3, a major product of immature granulocytes. A more liberal correction (Benjamini and Hochberg correction) yielded 18 additional genes, 12 of which are IFN-regulated and 4 granulocyte-specific. Indeed immature neutrophils were identified in a large fraction of SLE patients white blood cells. High dose glucocorticoids, a standard treatment of disease flares, shuts down the interferon signature, further supporting the role of this cytokine in SLE. The expression of 10 genes correlated with disease activity according to the SLEDAI. The most striking correlation (P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.55) was found with the formyl peptide receptor-like 1 protein that mediates chemotactic activities of defensins. Therefore, while the IFN signature confirms the central role of this cytokine in SLE, microarray analysis of blood cells reveals that immature granulocytes may be involved in SLE pathogenesis.",

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of healthy control PBMCs was used to determine the relative induction of a panel of IFN-inducible genes (IFIGs) by IFNalpha and IFNgamma. PBMCs from 77 SLE patients were compared with those from 22 disease controls and 28 healthy donors for expression of IFIGs. Expression of IFNalpha-inducible genes was significantly higher in SLE PBMCs than in those from disease controls or healthy donors. The level of expression of all IFIGs in PBMCs from SLE patients with IFNalpha pathway activation correlated highly with the inherent responsiveness of those genes to IFNalpha, suggesting coordinate activation of that cytokine pathway. Expression of genes preferentially induced by IFNgamma was not significantly increased in SLE PBMCs compared with control PBMCs. IFNalpha-regulated gene-inducing activity was detected in some SLE plasma samples. The coordinate activation of IFNalpha-induced genes is a characteristic of PBMCs from many SLE patients, supporting the hypothesis that IFNalpha is the predominant stimulus for IFIG expression in lupus.",

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional \"antagonist\" and \"agonist\" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells. These functions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems, modulating brain immune and phagocytic activities, preserving the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB), and the proliferation of neural precursor cells. Recently, FTY720 have shown receptor-independent effects, including intracellular target bindings and epigenetic modulations. Many researchers have recognized the positive effects of FTY720 and launched basic and clinical experiments to test the use of this agent against stroke. Although the mechanism of FTY720 has not been fully elucidated, its efficacy against cerebral stroke is becoming clear, not only in animal models, but also in ischemic stroke patients through clinical trials. In this article, we review the data obtained from laboratory findings and preliminary clinical trials using FTY720 for stroke treatment.",

However, the loss of the link between the precursor and the product ions combined with the high dimensionality of DIA data sets hinder accurate feature annotation. Here, we present LipidMS, an R package aimed to confidently identify lipid species in untargeted LC-DIA-MS. To this end, LipidMS combines a coelution score, which links precursor and fragment ions with fragmentation and intensity rules. Depending on the MS evidence reached by the identification function survey, LipidMS provides three levels of structural annotations: (i) \"subclass level\", e.g., PG(34:1); (ii) \"fatty acyl level\", e.g., PG(16:0_18:1); and (iii) \"fatty acyl position level\", e.g., PG(16:0/18:1). The comparison of LipidMS with freely available data dependent acquisition (DDA) and DIA identification tools showed that LipidMS provides significantly more accurate and structural informative lipid identifications. Finally, to exemplify the utility of LipidMS, we investigated the lipidomic serum profile of patients diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a disorder underlying a strong lipid dysregulation. As previously published, a significant decrease in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol esters and an increase in phosphatidylethanolamines were observed in NASH patients. Remarkably, LipidMS allowed the identification of a new set of lipids that may be used for NASH diagnosis.

Radiologists should also carefully evaluate follow-up images in PBM patients even years after prophylactic surgery because residual bile ducts remain at risk for cancer.<sup>\u00a9</sup>RSNA, 2020.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15836453": "The most common functional disorders of the biliary tract and pancreas are associated with disordered motility of the sphincter of Oddi (SO). The SO is a neuromuscular structure located at the junction of the bile and pancreatic ducts with the duodenum. The primary functions of the SO are to regulate the delivery of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and to prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic systems. Disordered motility of the SO leads to the common and painful clinical conditions of SO dysfunction and acute pancreatitis. In order to understand normal SO motility, studies have been performed addressing SO function, control of spontaneous SO activity, responses to bioactive agents, SO innervation, and reflexes with other gastrointestinal organs. These studies have led to the current understanding of how the SO functions and may permit the development of targeted therapy for SO dysfunction and acute pancreatitis. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the control and regulation of SO motility, highlighting laboratory based and clinical research performed over the last 5 years.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10409171": "We have investigated the existence of neural connections between the duodenum and the sphincter of Oddi (SO). Stimulation of duodenal myenteric fiber bundles elicited synaptic responses in SO neurons, which included nicotinic fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), slow EPSPs, and alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. After 48 h in organ culture, when extrinsic fibers had diminished, only the fast EPSPs persisted. Duodenal mucosal stimulation also elicited nicotinic fast EPSPs in SO neurons. There was no association between the SO neurons that received duodenal input and their chemical coding. A reciprocal projection also exists from the SO to the duodenum. In acute and cultured preparations, duodenal myenteric stimulation caused antidromic responses in 20% of SO neurons. Furthermore, 45.6 +/- 10.5 neurons in SO ganglia were retrogradely labeled from dye application sites in the duodenum. It is proposed that bidirectional neural communication occurs between the duodenum and the SO and that duodenal neurons provide excitatory fast synaptic input to SO neurons through a reflex that can be activated at the duodenal mucosa.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8026537": "We studied the role of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxation of the rabbit sphincter of Oddi by recording changes in isometric tension in response to electrical field stimulation in two series of experiments. In a first set of experiments, biliary sphincters of Oddi removed from New Zealand white rabbits were placed horizontally in an organ bath containing oxygenized, buffered (pH 7.4) Krebs solution. Contractile responses of the whole sphincter to field stimulation were determined. In the second set of experiments, sphincter of Oddi was divided into two parts and the effects of field stimulation were studied separately on areas close to the duodenal papilla (area I) and areas close to the common bile duct (area II). In the whole sphincter of Oddi, field stimulation induced an initial twitch-like contraction followed by relaxation proportional to the number of stimuli (3 and 10 stimuli at 20 Hz, 50 V, 0.1 ms). The magnitude of the contractile responses was considerably reduced by 1 microM atropine, phentolamine and oxprenolol (NANC solution). Field stimulation produced dose-dependent contractions of both segments of sphincter of Oddi in response to the same protocol as used with whole sphincter of Oddi. However, preincubation with NANC solution produced monophasic relaxations in response to field stimulation in area I, whereas area II preparations such as the whole sphincter of Oddi responded with contractions followed by minimal relaxations. Field stimulation failed to induce either contractions or relaxations in the presence of 1 microM tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15143221": "Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography has proved a robust and noninvasive imaging modality for evaluating the biliary and pancreatic ducts without the use of ionizing radiation. Although MR cholangiopancreatography reliably depicts the main extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, it does not depict the segmental intrahepatic ducts unless they are dilated. The segmental ducts are difficult to visualize with MR cholangiopancreatography because of their small caliber and the limited spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio achievable with standard MR pulse sequences. However, visualization of the normal (ie, nondistended) biliary system is necessary for the evaluation of donor candidates for living related liver transplantation. Because of the prevalence of variant biliary anatomy, MR cholangiopancreatography is often used for preoperative evaluation of prospective liver donors. Intravenous morphine administered prior to MR cholangiopancreatography can improve image quality by causing the sphincter of Oddi to contract, which increases pressure in and distention of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Morphine administration may also be particularly helpful for the evaluation of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, malignant neoplasms such as cholangiocarcinoma, or cystic and non-organ-deforming benign pancreatic neoplasms.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8419235": " This study investigated the existence of direct neural connections between the duodenum and the biliary tract in the Australian possum. Retrogradely transported neuronal dyes, Fast Blue and Dil, were injected into the wall of the gallbladder and the sphincter of Oddi. The duodenum, biliary tract, and sympathetic and sensory ganglia were examined for the presence of labeled cell bodies. Two to 3 weeks after gallbladder injection, labeled nerve cell bodies were found in the myenteric plexus of the proximal duodenum but were rare in the duodenum distal to the sphincter of Oddi. No neurons were found in the submucous plexus. Labeled nerve cells were also found in the sphincter of Oddi. After injection of the sphincter, labeled neurons were in both the submucous and myenteric plexuses of the duodenum, on either side. Approximately one third of labeled myenteric neurons were immunoreactive for enkephalin. Labeled cell bodies were also in the coeliaco-mesenteric, nodose, and dorsal root ganglia after both gallbladder and sphincter injection. After a myotomy on the proximal duodenum, no neurons were labeled on the pyloric side of the lesion by subsequent sphincter injection of dye. Direct neural pathways connect the duodenum with the gallbladder and the sphincter of Oddi, and the sphincter with the gallbladder; this implies that enteric nerve circuits participate in coordinating duodenal and biliary functions.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3049055": "The sphincter of Oddi is the smooth muscle connection between the bile duct and the duodenum. Its physiological function is associated with a regular motility characterized by phasic contractions superimposed on the sphincter of Oddi baseline pressure. Recently introduced ERCP-manometry permits further studies of sphincter of Oddi pharmacology. A number of drugs have so far been studied. Sedatives of the diazepam type had no effect on the sphincter, while butylscopolaminium bromide, a typical neurotropic agent, brings about cessation of the sphincter motility for 3-8 minutes. Hymecromon lowered the sphincter baseline pressure from 9.8 to 7.8 mmHg. A 1.2 mg sublingual dose of nitroglycerin, a typical musculotropic agent, caused significant relaxation of the sphincter, and decreased baseline pressure from 8.9 mmHg to 2.9 mmHg; Sphincter motility was not affected. Morphine-like analgetics, in particular pentazocine, elevated sphincter baseline pressure, but buprenorphine and tramadol did not. Pharmacological doses of gastrointestinal hormones also affect the sphincter; CCK octapeptide, glucagon and secretin are able to decrease sphincter of Oddi baseline pressure, and CCK octapeptide abolishes sphincter motility. Sphincter of Oddi pharmacology is of clinical interest. The administration of sphincter-relaxing agents, in particular nitroglycerin and butylscopolaminium bromide, enables the endoscopist to extract small common bile duct stones without previous papillotomy. Analgetics that induce sphincter contraction and thus hinder the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, may be helpful for the treatment of pain in patients with pancreatico-biliary disease. Investigations into the effect of CCK on the healthy and diseased sphincter permit us to identify patients with sphincter dysfunction using a special CCK-provocation test.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19799700": "The most common functional disorder of the biliary tract and pancreas relates to the activity of the Sphincter of Oddi. The Sphincter of Oddi is a small smooth muscle sphincter strategically placed at the junction of the bile duct, pancreatic duct, and duodenum. The sphincter controls flow of bile and pancreatic juices into the duodenum and prevents reflux of duodenal content into the ducts. Disorder in its motility is called Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Clinically this presents either with recurrent abdominal biliary type pain or episodes of recurrent pancreatitis. Manometry may identify the motility abnormalities, the most clinically significant being an abnormally elevated basal pressure. The most effective treatment once an abnormal basal pressure is identified is division of the sphincter. This is associated with good long-term results.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6065875": "Flow through the sphincter of Oddi was studied by a constant-pressure perfusion apparatus, and by using a constant rate of infusion and measuring pressure changes just proximal to the sphincter. Pressure changes from balloons placed in the gastric antrum and duodenum were recorded. Despite considerable variation in activity and behaviour, the following conclusions were reached.1. The sphincter of Oddi appears to be partially autonomous but is readily affected by changes in duodenal tone.2. Reflex inhibition of the sphincter of Oddi is seen on electrical and mechanical stimulation of the gall-bladder but not with passive pressure changes within the gall-bladder.3. This reflex is relayed through the coeliac ganglion.4. There is a definite relationship between gastric antral activity and flow through the sphincter of Oddi. This is more obvious when food is present in the stomach.5. Mechanical or electrical stimulation of the stomach, duodenum, or upper small bowel influences the tone of the sphincter of Oddi.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11900681": "Major papilla pancreatic sphincter dysfunction, a variant of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, causes pancreatitis and pancreatic-type pain. The gold standard for diagnosis is sphincter of Oddi manometry, most commonly performed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Noninvasive testing, such as secretin-stimulated transabdominal or endoscopic ultrasound assessment of pancreatic duct diameter, is less reliable and has relatively low sensitivity. Two thirds of patients with biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction have elevated pancreatic basal sphincter pressure. To maximize the diagnostic yield of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, both the biliary and pancreatic sphincter pressures should be measured. Patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may respond to biliary sphincterotomy alone, but evaluation of their pancreatic sphincter is warranted if symptoms persist after biliary therapy alone. Whether both biliary and pancreatic sphincters should be treated at the first ERCP session is controversial. Biliary and pancreatic endoscopic sphincterotomies are associated with two- to fourfold increased incidence of pancreatitis following the procedure in patients with pancreatic sphincter hypertension. Prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting reduces the frequency and severity of complications by greater than 50%.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7549047": "It has been reported that interdigestive motor activities occur in the gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi as well as in the gastroduodenal tract and truncal vagus nerves modulate the gastroduodenal motility pattern. In the present study, the vagal branches which influence on the interdigestive motor activity of these organs were determined in conscious dogs. In the normal dog, interdigestive motor activities closely related to interdigestive migrating motor complex (IMC) in the gastric antrum and descending duodenum were recorded in the gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi. In dogs whose celiac branches of the vagus nerve were chronically resected, cycle periods of interdigestive motor activity in the stomach, duodenum, gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi significantly prolonged as compared with those in the normal dog but the interrelation of them persisted. Quiescent period in motility prolonged and the active period shortened. Resection of the pyloric branches had no influence on the interdigestive motor activities in all organs. The results imply that celiac branches of the vagus nerve modulate the interdigestive motor activity in the stomach, descending duodenum, gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2052626": "The sphincter of Oddi is a small sphincter which is strategically placed at the junction of the bile duct and pancreatic duct with the duodenum. It regulates the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum and prevents reflux of duodenal contents into the ducts. The structure of the sphincter of Oddi differs from species to species and consequently its physiological action varies in different species. Anatomical and immunohistochemical investigations have demonstrated that the sphincter of Oddi is richly innervated by cholinergic, adrenergic and peptidergic neurons. In addition, neural connections exist between the sphincter, gallbladder and proximal gastrointestinal tract. These nerves in addition to hormones are important in the control of sphincter of Oddi motility and function. The normal human sphincter of Oddi is characterized by prominent phasic contractions which are superimposed on a modest basal pressure. These contractions are present throughout the interdigestive period. The contractions and basal pressure are inhibited by ingestion of a meal or infusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide, thus enhancing the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction has been described in patients who present with recurrent biliary type pain and no evidence of a structural cause for the pain. Motility disorders characterized as an elevated basal pressure, rapid contraction frequency, paradoxical response to cholecystokinin octapeptide or excess of retrograde contractions have been identified. A number of pharmacologically active substances have been used in an attempt to treat these patients. Such pharmaceuticals include nitrites, Ca2+ channel blockers and smooth muscle relaxants. Their effect is transient and side effects relating to cardiovascular actions preclude their longterm use. Division of the sphincter either endoscopically or by open operation has been demonstrated by prospective clinical trials to be the most efficacious treatment for patients with a stenosed sphincter manometrically demonstrated by a high basal pressure. Improved understanding of the controlling mechanisms of sphincter of Oddi motility and the pathophysiology of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction should assist in the development of effective pharmacotherapy for these disorders.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3653618": "One hundred and nine successive post mortem examinations have been performed with a peculiar attention to the gross and microscopic features of the sphincter of Oddi. Biliary lesions were present in 24 cases and pancreatic lesions in 7 cases. According to previous histologic descriptions, a group of 18 pathologic sphincters of Oddi was selected. Biliary lesions were not more common in this group (28 p. 100) than in the group with a normal sphincter of Oddi (21 p. 100) and inversely, there were no more lesions of the sphincter of Oddi in the group with biliary lesions (21 p. 100) than in the group without biliary lesions (15 p. 100). Chronic pancreatitis was more frequently associated with an abnormal sphincter of Oddi, but in these cases, another associated disease could explain pancreatitis (alcoholism, hemochromatosis). Pathologic lesions of the sphincter of Oddi are frequent and usually latent. These features are not simple anatomic variations because five cases were undoubtedly pathologic with an important thickening of the sphincter and a fibro-adenomatosic pattern. This study shows that sclerosing odditis does exist but is rare.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2666281": "Ever since its description approximately 100 years ago, the sphincter of Oddi has been surrounded by controversy. First, whether it indeed existed, second, whether it had a significant physiological role in man and more recently whether abnormalities in its function give rise to a clinical syndrome. Data from animal and human studies, using sensitive techniques, have helped define the physiological role of the sphincter of Oddi, and more recent studies are determining the factors which control sphincter of Oddi function. These studies support Oddi's original description that the sphincter has a major role in the control of flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and equally importantly helps prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems. The controversy of whether abnormalities in sphincter of Oddi motility result in clinical syndromes has not been totally resolved. Part of the difficulty has been inability to document normal and hence abnormal function of the sphincter. With the emergence of endoscopic biliary manometry as a sensitive and reproducible technique, however, the motility of the human sphincter of Oddi has come under closer scrutiny and allowed definition of possible disorders. We have used the term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction to define manometric abnormalities in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin. Based on the manometry, we have subdivided the dysfunction into two groups; a group characterised by a stenotic pattern - that is, raised sphincter basal pressure - and a second group having a dyskinetic pattern - that is, paradoxical response to cholecystokinin injection, rapid contraction frequency, high percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal pressure. It is apparent from the mamometry but also from the clinical data that the patients are a heterogeneous group and thus any therapy would need to be tailored for each patient and abnormality. The most recent therapeutic data suggest that patients with the stenotic pattern on manometry respond to division of the sphincter, however, those patients with the dyskinetic manometric pattern show no significant effect after sphincterotomy. Further prospective trials evaluating therapeutic options are under way and their results are eagerly awaited.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3058076": "The sphincter of Oddi (SO) is critically located at the junction of the common bile duct (CBD), main pancreatic duct, and the duodenum. It is a high-pressure zone with phasic contractions that regulate bile and pancreatic juice flow. The SO is probably regulated by several gastrointestinal hormones, and its basal pressure and phasic contractions can be elevated or decreased significantly by exogenous drugs. Its role in gallstone formation is probably negligible, but severing the SO allows one to extract CBD stones with an endoscope. Abnormal function of the SO can cause biliarylike pain. Of patients with persistent pain after cholecystectomy, 14% have abnormal SO manometric findings. Endoscopic or surgical sphincterotomy can cure these patients of their pain. The SO may play a significant role in the development of pancreatitis in certain patients, either because of the relationship of the CBD orifice to the pancreatic duct orifice created by the SO or because of the response of the SO to exogenous agents, such as alcohol."
