We describe a 10-year-old boy with syndromic obesity who carries a novel 1p21.3 deletion overlapping the critical region with the <i>MIR137</i> gene only.

Recent studies identified miRNAs as important regulators of learning and memory in model organisms. So far, no mutations in specific miRNA genes have been associated with impaired cognitive functions. In three sibs and two unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID), overlapping 1p21.3 deletions were detected by genome-wide array analysis. The shortest region of overlap included dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and microRNA 137 (MIR137). DPYD is involved in autosomal recessive dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. Hemizygous DPYD deletions were previously suggested to contribute to a phenotype with autism spectrum disorder and speech delay. Interestingly, the mature microRNA transcript microRNA-137 (miR-137) was recently shown to be involved in modulating neurogenesis in adult murine neuronal stem cells. Therefore, this study investigated the possible involvement of MIR137 in the 1p21.3-deletion phenotype. The patients displayed a significantly decreased expression of both precursor and mature miR-137 levels, as well as significantly increased expression of the validated downstream targets microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila, Homologue 2 (EZH2), and the newly identified target Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). The study also demonstrated significant enrichment of miR-137 at the synapses of cortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role of miR-137 in regulating local synaptic protein synthesis machinery. This study showed that dosage effects of MIR137 are associated with 1p21.3 microdeletions and may therefore contribute to the ID phenotype in patients with deletions harbouring this miRNA. A local effect at the synapse might be responsible.",

Recent reports have documented the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) in the treatment of adenomas resistant to conventional management. Objective. The review of the literature concerning TMZ treatment of atypical corticotroph adenomas and a case study of 56-year-old woman who developed Nelson's syndrome. Treatment Proceeding. The patient with Cushing's disease underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy followed by a 27-month-long period of remission. Due to a regrowth of the tumor, she underwent two reoperations followed by stereotactic radiotherapy. Because of treatment failures, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Then she developed Nelson's syndrome. A fourth transsphenoidal adenomectomy was performed, but there was a rapid recurrence. Five months later, she underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy. Due to a rapid regrowth of the tumour, the patient did not receive gamma-knife therapy and was treated with cabergoline and somatostatin analogue for some time. Only TMZ therapy resulted in marked clinical, biochemical, and radiological improvement. To date, this is the first case of invasive corticotroph adenoma in Nelson's syndrome treated with temozolomide in Poland. Conclusion. In our opinion, temozolomide can be an effective treatment option of invasive adenomas in Nelson's syndrome.",

Identification of D(2) receptors in corticotroph tumors led to clinical trials of cabergoline therapy in limited cases of Nelson's syndrome, ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors, and recently Cushing's disease (CD). To evaluate the long-term efficacy of cabergoline monotherapy in patients with CD. Retrospective analysis of non-randomized clinical therapy with cabergoline in 30 patients with CD treated in academic centers of Buenos Aires and Montreal. Cabergoline was initiated at 0.5-1.0 mg/week and adjusted up to a maximal dose of 6 mg/week based on urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels. Complete response to cabergoline was defined as a sustained normalization of UFC with at least two normal values measured at 1-3 months interval; partial response was defined as a decrease of UFC to &lt;125% of the upper limit of normal, and treatment failure as UFC \u2265 125% of it. Within 3-6 months, complete response was achieved in 11 patients (36.6%) and partial response in 4 patients (13.3%). After long-term therapy, nine patients (30%) remain with a complete response after a mean of 37 months (range from 12 to 60 months) with a mean dose of 2.1 mg/week of cabergoline. Two patients escaped after 2 and 5 years of complete response, but one patient transiently renormalized UFC after an increase in cabergoline dosage. No long-term response was maintained in four initial partial responders. Cabergoline monotherapy can provide an effective long-term medical therapy for selected patients with CD, but requires close follow-up for dose adjustments.",

Trough the observation of a patient suffering from a severe form of Nelson's syndrome for more than 10 years, the authors review the literature and discuss the main current therapeutic possibilities. Many molecules have been used with variable results. In our observation cabergoline at 2 mg per week seems to be efficient after a 3 and a half years follow-up, in accordance with some recent publications. More than bromocriptine, this dopamine agonist provides interesting prospects for this disease's management. Moreover, if the conventional treatments as valproic acid or cyproheptadine are not very efficient, somatostatin analogs seem to be of some therapeutic interest. New molecules are currently evaluated, but studies are difficult to conduct because of the low disease prevalence.

The disease presented 26 years after bilateral adrenalectomy and radiation treatment for Cushing's disease, followed by glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Signs of Nelson's syndrome included skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation accompanied by elevated plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (984 pmol/l; normal, 2.0-11.5 pmol/l). Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary demonstrated sellar enlargement with a 15 mm macroadenoma. The patient was initially treated with bromocriptine (10 mg/d) which had no effect on either ACTH level or tumor mass. Because of visual loss, transsphenoidal surgery was performed, with partial excision of the adenoma and chiasmal decompression, followed by radiosurgery. However, ACTH levels improved only temporarily, and then increased to previous levels. Therefore, cabergoline treatment (1.5 mg/week) was initiated. ACTH levels decreased dramatically from 1050 to 132 pmol/l, accompanied by clinical improvement. Repeated imaging studies demonstrated a stable residual pituitary tumor.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16311416": "The neurotransmitter/neuromodulator dopamine plays an important role in both the central nervous system and the periphery. In the hypothalamopituitary system its function is a dominant and tonic inhibitory regulation of pituitary hormone secretion including prolactin- and proopiomelanocortin-derived hormones. It is well known that dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, pergolide, quinagolide, cabergoline, and lisuride, can inhibit PRL secretion by binding to the D(2) dopamine receptors located on normal as well as tumorous pituitary cells. Moreover, they can effectively decrease excessive PRL secretion as well as the size of the tumor in patients having prolactinoma. Furthermore, dopamine agonists can also be used in other pituitary tumors. The major requirement for its use is that the tumor cells should express D(2) receptors. Therefore, in addition to prolactinomas, targets of dopamine agonist therapy are somatotroph tumors, nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, corticotroph pituitary tumors, Nelson's syndrome, gonadotropinomas, and thyrotropin-secreting pituitary tumors. It is also an option for the treatment of pituitary disease during pregnancy.

At the age of 26 years, the patient exhibited the clinical signs of the Nelson's syndrome, i.e. skin and gingival hyperpigmentation accompanied by amenorrhea, and elevated ACTH plasma levels (2,850 pg/ml, normal range 15-80 pg/ml). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis of the sellar region evidenced a pituitary macroadenoma, measuring 14 x 13 mm. The patient was initially treated with cyproheptadine hydrochloride (12 mg/day) for 18 months. There was a partial improvement of the symptoms, with a reduction of the ACTH plasma levels to 112 pg/ml, but without any modification of the tumor mass. Due to sleepiness and weight gain, the cyproheptadine treatment was interrupted and substituted by a cabergoline (0.5 mg twice a week) therapy. Soon after cabergoline was applied an improvement of the clinical symptoms and signs was observed such as a regression of the tumor mass and the normalization of the ACTH plasma titers (38 pg/ml). Later, cabergoline was substituted by bromocriptine (7.5 mg/day) and the plasma levels of ACTH increased again (247 pg/ml), and headache and cutaneous hyperpigmentation were recorded. When cabergoline was reintroduced there was a clinical improvement and normalization of ACTH plasma levels (64 pg/ml). The MRI analysis of the sella region demonstrated a complete remission of the pituitary adenoma. The results obtained show for the first time that a long-term treatment with cabergoline also brings about a complete remission of Nelson's syndrome in the presence of a pituitary macroadenoma.",

Thereafter, he was given cortisone acetate replacement at the dose of 62.5 mg a day. Fifteen months after pituitary irradiation, he developed Nelson's syndrome, having skin hyperpigmentation, high plasma ACTH levels (376 ng/l) and a pituitary microadenoma (5 mm) documented at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary region.

Plasma ACTH levels significantly increased (119 ng/l) after 3 months of treatment withdrawal. At the last follow-up, during cabergoline treatment at the dose of 2 mg/week plasma ACTH levels were normalized (40.4 ng/l).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10971110": "Recently, the medical approach to patients with secreting and clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas has received great impulse thanks to the availability of new, selective and long-lasting compounds with dopaminergic activity, such as cabergoline, and of somatostatin analogues provided in slow-release formulations, such as lanreotide and octreotide long acting release (LAR). In particular, the use of cabergoline has induced control of hyperprolactinaemia and tumour shrinkage in the great majority of patients with micro- and macroprolactinomas. Cabergoline treatment restores fertility both in women and men, and partially improves osteoporosis, one of the major complications of hyperprolactinaemia. In acromegaly, disease control (growth hormone [GH] &lt;2.5-1.0 microg/l as a fasting or glucose-suppressed value, respectively, together with age-normalised insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-I) is achievable in more than half of patients receiving treatment with lanreotide or octreotide-LAR. Improvement in cardiomyopathy, sleep apnoea and arthropathy has been reported during GH/IGF-I suppression after pharmacotherapy. A synthetic GH analogue, B2036-PEG, that antagonises endogenous GH binding to its receptor-binding sites and a GH-releasing hormone antagonist that blocks the effect of this releasing factor on the hypothalamus and pituitary are presently under investigation in acromegaly. Preliminary studies have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the GH receptor antagonist in suppressing IGF-I levels in acromegalic patients previously unresponsive to somatostatin analogues. Beneficial effects of subcutaneous octreotide and lanreotide have also been reported in adenomas secreting thyroid-stimulating hormone, while the results of treatment with dopamine agonists or somatostatin analogues remain disappointing in patients with clinically non-functioning adenomas. In these patients the possibility of visualising in vivo the expression of D(2) receptors using specific radiotracers such as (123)I-methoxybenzamide has allowed selection of patients likely to respond to cabergoline. Scant effects of pharmacotherapy have also been reported in patients with adenomas secreting adrenocorticotropic hormone.

The large size and extensive glycosylation present challenges to study the mucin structure using traditional methods, including crystallography. We offer the hypothesis that the functional versatility of mucins may be attributed to the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that provide dynamism and flexibility and that the IDRs offer potential therapeutic targets. Herein, we examined the links between the mucin structure and function based on IDRs, posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and potential impact on their interactome. Using sequence-based bioinformatics tools, we observed that mucins are predicted to be moderately (20%-40%) to highly (&gt;40%) disordered and many conserved mucin domains could be disordered. Phosphorylation sites overlap with IDRs throughout the mucin sequences. Additionally, the majority of predicted O- and N- glycosylation sites in the tandem repeat regions occur within IDRs and these IDRs contain a large number of functional motifs, that is, molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which directly influence protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This investigation provides a novel perspective and offers an insight into the complexity and dynamic nature of mucins.",

Because mucin functions as a first line of the innate immune system, Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to require interaction with mucin to establish infection in the host. However, the interactions between P. aeruginosa and mucin have been poorly understood. In this study, using in vivo expression technology (IVET), we attempted to identify mucin-inducible promoters that are likely to be involved in the establishment of P. aeruginosa infection. The IVET analysis revealed that the genes encoding glycosidases, sulfatases, and peptidases that are thought to be required for the utilization of mucin as a nutrient are present in 13 genes downstream of the identified promoters. Our results indicated that, among them, sdsA1 encoding a secreted sulfatase plays a central role in the degradation of mucin. It was then demonstrated that disruption of sdsA1 leads to a decreased release of sulfate from mucin and sulfated sugars. Furthermore, the sdsA1 mutant showed a reduction in the ability of mucin gel penetration and an attenuation of virulence in leukopenic mice compared with the wild-type strain. Collectively, these results suggest that SdsA1 plays an important role as a virulence factor of P. aeruginosa.",

We hypothesize that impaired Cosmc-dependent <i>O</i>-glycosylation in podocytes is sufficient to cause disease. Podocyte-specific <i>Cosmc</i> knockout mice were generated and phenotyped to test this hypothesis. Female heterozygous mice displaying mosaic inactivation of <i>Cosmc</i> in podocytes due to random X-linked inactivation were also examined. Mice with podocyte-specific <i>Cosmc</i> deletion develop profound albuminuria, foot process effacement, glomerular sclerosis, progressive renal failure, and impaired survival. Glomerular transcriptome analysis reveals early changes in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, and chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, coupled with podocyte loss. Expression of the <i>O</i>-glycoprotein podoplanin was lost, while Tn antigen, representing immature <i>O</i>-glycans, was most abundantly found on podocalyxin. In contrast to hemizygous male and homozygous female animals, heterozygous female mosaic animals developed only mild albuminuria, focal foot process effacement, and nonprogressive kidney disease. Ultrastructurally, Cosmc-deficient podocytes formed Tn antigen-positive foot processes interdigitating with those of normal podocytes but not with other Cosmc-deficient cells. This suggests a cell nonautonomous mechanism for mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycoproteins in maintaining podocyte function. In summary, our findings demonstrated an essential and likely cell nonautonomous role for mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycosylation for podocyte function.",

Often, a nerve conduction study (NCS) is performed before CTR; however, there are various reports questioning the sensitivity of NCS, and some patients do undergo CTR despite normal NCS results. We had the following purposes: (1) to report clinical outcome of CTS patients who undergo CTR despite normal NCS, (2) to identify the characteristics and compare those with abnormal NCS patients in terms of basic features and risk factors, and (3) to analyze and compare normal and abnormal NCS results. Medical records of 546 CTS (30 normal NCS and 516 abnormal NCS) patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of 30 normal NCS patients, 7 were excluded, leaving 23 patients in the experimental group. We investigated the influence of age, sex, operative arm, and body mass index, as well as medical conditions known to be risk factors for CTS. In normal NCS patients, as a functional score, we investigated Boston carpal tunnel scores before and after CTR. The NCS results were compared in terms of median motor and median sensory testing. In normal NCS patients, NCS data were compared with that of the contralateral nonoperated wrists. There were 18 women and 5 men in the normal NCS group (mean age 43.7 years). On physical examination, 22 (94.7%) patients showed a positive Tinel test, 19 (82.6%) showed a positive Phalen test, 8 (34.8%) complained of nocturnal paresthesia, and only 1 (4.3%) presented with thenar atrophy. In 19 of 23 patients, the Boston CTS scores showed significant improvement after CTR. Normal NCS patients were significantly younger and significantly heavier and more likely to be a current smoker. In NCS analysis of normal NCS patients, the operated wrists were closer to the reference values than nonoperated wrists. Surgeons should evaluate the possibility of other combined lesions before CTR in normal NCS patients. Normal NCS can be present with a CTS diagnosis, especially in younger patients.

Nonsurgical management is still a matter of debate, and conservative treatments include splinting, local steroid injections, ultrasound, and oral steroids. Acupuncture and electroacupuncture therapy for symptomatic CTS may improve symptoms and aid nerve repair as well as improve sensory and motor functions. However, limited evidence based on comprehensive evaluation methods is available regarding the effects of those treatments. The study intended to compare the short-term effects of acupuncture and conventional medical treatment on CTS patients' clinical symptoms and on the results of their electrodiagnostic tests. The research team designed a randomized controlled trial. The study took place at the electrodiagnostic clinic of the School of Persian and Complementary Medicine at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (Mashhad, Iran). Participants were 60 patients at the clinic with the clinical diagnosis of CTS. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Patients in the control group received 100 mg of Celebrex as tablets, 2 times daily. Patients in the intervention group received 12 sessions of acupuncture, each for 30 min, for 4 wk. The needle insertion points were fixed for all sessions. In addition, wrist braces were provided to wear at night for 1 mo in both groups. At baseline, postintervention at the end of week 4, and at a 3-mo follow-up at the end of week 16, participants' clinical symptoms-pain, numbness, tingling, weakness/clumsiness, and night awakenings-and the results of their electrodiagnostic studies were evaluated and compared. In total, 49 patients completed the study-24 in the control group and 25 in the intervention group. Compared with the control group, the intervention group's clinical symptoms-pain, numbness, tingling, and muscular weakness-based on the subscales of the global symptoms score questionnaire as well as the overall score on that questionnaire improved significantly (P &lt; .05). Regarding the electrodiagnostic studies, only the distal motor latency showed a significantly greater decrease in the acupuncture group in comparison to controls (P = .001).

This syndrome is caused by entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist (Preston and Shapiro, 2005) when the pressure increases in the carpal tunnel. A high division of the median nerve proximal to the carpal tunnel, also known as a bifid median nerve, is a rare anatomic variation that may be associated with CTS and with persistent median vessels (Lanz, 1977). This anatomic variation has an incidence of 0,8% to 2,3% in patients with CTS. Lanz (1977) has characterized this anatomic condition of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. These anatomic variants have been classified into four groups: - Group 0: extraligamentous thenar branch (standard anatomy); - Group 1: variations of the course of the thenar branch; - Group 2: accessory branches at the distal portion of the carpal tunnel; - Group 3: divided or duplicated median nerve inside the carpal tunnel; - Group 4: accessory branches proximal to the carpal tunnel. During dissection of the wrist performed for the treatment of a CTS under local anesthesia, we found an anatomical variation of the median nerve that was divided in two branches inside the carpal tunnel (Group 3 of Lanz Classification) and in which its radial branch passed through its own compartment. The two parts of the nerve seems to be unequal in size (Fig. 1). Moreover the nerve passed in carpal tunnel associated with a median artery, so we classified this variation in the group 3b of Lanz Classification (Fig. 2). The persistence of median artery coexisting with a bifid median nerve has been widely reported in surgical literature (Lanz, 1977; Barbe et al., 2005). Before surgical intervention clinical evaluation of patient and electrophysiological examination showed no differences compared to a non bifid median nerve entrapment syndrome. In conclusion the bifid median nerve may facilitate compression of median nerve in the carpal tunnel because of its increased cross sectional area even if it has no electrophysiological or clinical differential diagnosis in case of CTS. The aim of this letter is aware the physicians in order to borne in mind the possible presence of a median nerve variation during dissection of carpal tunnel in order to avoid the damage of this non common anatomical structures.",

Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 30 adult patients who had undergone carpal tunnel release or ulnar nerve decompression at the elbow 6-24 months prior. Interviews were digitally audio recorded and transcribed, and the data subjected to thematic analysis. Four overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) most patients did not perceive their condition to be serious; (2) patients were satisfied with the overall surgical experience; (3) the outcome was more important to patients than the process; and (4) majority of patients had a realistic expectation of outcomes. Patients had a positive experience with carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve decompression surgery, although their level of satisfaction was dependent on the surgical outcome. Areas requiring improvement, specifically information about post-operative care and expectations of recovery, will be implemented in the future care of patients.",

In spite of their ubiquitous nature, they are underdiagnosed, underreported, and sometimes not properly managed, especially in developing countries. Entrapment neuropathies are of various types, but the most common type is carpal tunnel syndrome. Mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of entrapment neuropathies include mechanical compression and nerve ischemia. A clear understanding of the various types and the underlying mechanisms of entrapment neuropathies are invaluable in the decision-making process involved in the management of every patient with the condition.",

The etiologies of tarsal tunnel syndrome are mainly the presence of a ganglion, osseous prominence with tarsal bone coalition, trauma, varicose veins, neurinoma, hypertrophy of the flexor retinaculum, or systemic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis). However, no specific cause can be identified in some cases. Patients with chronic renal failure tend to develop peripheral nerve entrapment and carpal tunnel syndrome is the best-known peripheral entrapment neuropathy among them. Contrary to carpal tunnel syndrome, tarsal tunnel syndrome is observed less frequently in chronic renal failure patients. The common presenting symptoms of TTS are paresthesias and/or pain in the plantar side of the foot. Motor symptoms are rarely detected. Diagnosis is made primarily by electroneuromyographic studies and physical examination. Surgery is the treatment of choice and the outcome is generally favourable.

In the last years, several studies have demonstrated the presence of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms. To review the basis neurophysiology of peripheral and central sensitization by applying them to CTS and to determine their clinical repercussions. Several studies have revealed that patients with CTS exhibit somato-sensory changes in areas innervated by the median nerve and also in areas non-related with the median nerve. Individuals with CTS exhibited widespread mechanical and thermal pain hyperalgesia, although they suffered from unilateral symptoms. Further, patients also showed wide-spread impairments in vibration conduction, deficits in fine motor control and changes in the somato-sensory cortex. These evidences support the presence of a complex process of peripheral and central sensitization in patients with CTS which may constitute a negative prognosis factor for the management of these patients. The advances in neurosciences in the last years support the presence of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms in CTS. These mechanisms justify the necessity of conceptual changes and in the management, both conservative and surgical, of this syndrome. Additionally, central sensitization can also play a relevant role in the prognosis of CTS since it can constitute a negative prognosis factor for its treatment.",

In all cases the median nerve was seen as an ovoid structure of moderate signal intensity and was easily distinguished from the flexor tendons of the hands running in the carpal tunnel. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) serves as an extremely useful tool for evaluation of primary nerve pathologies and for the assessment of space-occupying lesions leading to its compression. We present a pictorial review of the MRI findings in the multitude of pathologies implicated in the causation of carpal tunnel syndrome.

We evaluated structural reorganization in brain gray (GM) and white (WM) matter and whether such plasticity is linked to altered median nerve function in CTS. We performed NCV testing, T1-weighted structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 28 CTS and 28 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) contrasted regional GM volume for CTS versus HC. Significant clusters were correlated with clinical metrics and served as seeds to define associated WM tracts using DTI data and probabilistic tractography. Within these WM tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity were evaluated for group differences and correlations with clinical metrics. For CTS subjects, GM volume was significantly reduced in contralesional S1 (hand-area), pulvinar and frontal pole. GM volume in contralesional S1 correlated with median NCV. NCV was also correlated with RD and was negatively correlated with FA within U-fiber cortico-cortical association tracts identified from the contralesional S1 VBM seed. Our study identified clear morphometric changes in the CTS brain. This central morphometric change is likely secondary to peripheral nerve pathology and altered somatosensory afference. Enhanced axonal coherence and myelination within cortico-cortical tracts connecting primary somatosensory and motor areas may accompany peripheral nerve deafferentation. As structural plasticity was correlated with NCV and not symptomatology, the former may be a better determinant of appropriate clinical intervention for CTS, including surgery.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CTS on force coordination and muscle coherence during low-intensity sustained precision pinch while the wrist assumed different postures. Twenty subjects (10 CTS patients and 10 asymptomatic controls) participated in this study. An instrumented pinch device was used to measure the thumb and index finger forces while simultaneously collecting surface electromyographic activities of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles. Subjects performed a sustained precision pinch at 10% maximum pinch force for 15 sec with the wrist stabilized at 30\u00b0 extension, neutral, or 30\u00b0 flexion using customized splints. The force discrepancy and the force coordination angle between the thumb and index finger forces were calculated, as well as the \u03b2-band (15-30 Hz) coherence between APB and FDI. The index finger applied greater force than the thumb (p &lt; 0.05); this force discrepancy was increased with wrist flexion (p &lt; 0.05), but was not affected by CTS (p &gt; 0.05). The directional force coordination was not significantly affected by wrist posture or CTS (p &gt; 0.05). In general, digit force coordination during precision pinch seems to be sensitive to wrist flexion, but is not affected by CTS. The \u03b2-band muscular coherence was increased by wrist flexion for CTS patients (p &lt; 0.05), which could be a compensatory mechanism for the flexion-induced exacerbation of CTS symptoms. This study demonstrates that wrist flexion negatively influences muscle and force coordination in CTS patients supporting the avoidance of flexion posture for symptom exacerbation and functional performance.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6756339": "Clinicians commonly observe upper extremity signs and symptoms which result from median nerve entrapment and can develop at multiple sites along this nerve. Median nerve entrapment may occur at the distal humerus when the rarely present ligament of Struthers connects an anomalous bony spur of the humeral shaft to its medial epicondyle. The pronator syndrome refers to compromise of the median nerve in the proximal forearm region. This may result from entrapment between the 2 heads of the pronator teres, between the pronator teres and the flexor digitorum sublimis, or by the lacertus fibrosus extension from the biceps tendon. The anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve is subject to compromise near its origin. As a motor nerve it produces signs of weakness as indicators of anterior interosseous syndrome. This syndrome usually occurs spontaneously, but can be caused by fractures and fibrous bands. The carpal tunnel is a narrow fibro-osseous tunnel through which the median nerve passes with 9 tendons. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common of the median nerve entrapments. Its causes are many: anything which increases the volume of the tunnel contents or decreases the size of the tunnel. Electrodiagnostic abnormalities exist more frequently when this entrapment is present than for other median nerve entrapments. Anatomic variations of the median nerve occur frequently and may lead to diagnostic confusion if not recognized. Successful diagnosis and treatment of median nerve entrapment syndromes require awareness of possible involved sites and detailed knowledge of related anatomy.",

Am J Public Health 84:190-196, 1994; Stevens et al. Neurology 38:134-138, 1988). A combination of described symptoms, clinical findings and electrophysiological testing is used to confirm the diagnosis. Several studies have suggested that in patients with a clinical diagnosis of CTS, the accuracy of nerve sonography is similar to that for electromyography (Chen et al. BMC Med Imaging 11:22, 2011; Guan et al. Neurol Res 33:970-953, 2011; Kele et al. Neurology 61:389-391, 2003; Tai et al. Ultrasound Med Biol 38:1121-1128, 2012). In special cases though, the nerve sonography can reveal the cause of the median entrapment neuropathy (Fumi\u00e8re et al. JBR-BTR 85:1-3, 2002; Kele et al. J Neurosurg 97:471-473, 2002; Kele et al. Neurology 61:389-391, 2003; Zamora et al. J Clin Ultrasound 39:44-47, 2011). A 43-year-old farmer was admitted to our department with 1 year of intermittent pain in the left hand and numbness of the thumb, index and middle finger. The pain and the numbness could be reproduced by extension of the wrist and fingers. The electrophysiological testing revealed signs of an entrapment median neuropathy in carpal tunnel. The high-resolution sonography (18 MHz) revealed signs of entrapment neuropathy with increased cross-sectional area, disturbed echostructure of the nerve and pathological wrist-to-forearm ratio, confirming the results from a similar study (Kele et al. Neurology 61:389-391, 2003). In addition, an elongated muscle belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis in the carpal tunnel could be identified. During the extension of the wrist and fingers, a greater protrusion of the muscle belly could be demonstrated causing compression of the median nerve. We present a video case report of the sonographic findings of a patient diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome due to an elongated muscle belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis in the carpal tunnel. Our case highlights the importance of nerve sonography in the differential diagnosis of the cause of a carpal tunnel syndrome. With the aid of ultrasonography, it is possible to obtain very important information concerning different aspects of this case. First, in showing the presence of the elongated muscle belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis, the cause of the symptoms could be explained. Second, it was possible through the ultrasound study to explain the atypical clinical appearance in this case, demonstrating the compression neuropathy only after extension of the wrist and fingers. There have been no previous reports in which authors described an elongated muscle belly as cause of a CTS. Third, and perhaps most important, ultrasonography had a direct influence on our selection of therapeutical strategy and approach. As a result, we recommended in this patient a surgical therapy to completely solve the problem, but the patient declined this option and preferred a conservative therapy with a hand orthosis to prevent wrist extension. In conclusion we recommend ultrasonography as a very useful method in the diagnostic evaluation of carpal tunnel syndrome. We have clearly demonstrated that ultrasonography can be used to discover the cause of median nerve compression, especially in cases with an atypical clinical presentation.",

Recent reports have shown that this syndrome is also characterized by functional and structural neuroplasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex of the brain. However, the linkage between this neuroplasticity and the functional deficits in carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. Sixty-three subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome aged 20-60 years and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were evaluated with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T while vibrotactile stimulation was delivered to median nerve innervated (second and third) and ulnar nerve innervated (fifth) digits. For each subject, the interdigit cortical separation distance for each digit's contralateral primary somatosensory cortex representation was assessed. We also evaluated fine motor skill performance using a previously validated psychomotor performance test (maximum voluntary contraction and visuomotor pinch/release testing) and tactile discrimination capacity using a four-finger forced choice response test. These biobehavioural and clinical metrics were evaluated and correlated with the second/third interdigit cortical separation distance. Compared with healthy control subjects, subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome demonstrated reduced second/third interdigit cortical separation distance (P &lt; 0.05) in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex, corroborating our previous preliminary multi-modal neuroimaging findings. For psychomotor performance testing, subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome demonstrated reduced maximum voluntary contraction pinch strength (P &lt; 0.01) and a reduced number of pinch/release cycles per second (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, for four-finger forced-choice testing, subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome demonstrated greater response time (P &lt; 0.05), and reduced sensory discrimination accuracy (P &lt; 0.001) for median nerve, but not ulnar nerve, innervated digits. Moreover, the second/third interdigit cortical separation distance was negatively correlated with paraesthesia severity (r = -0.31, P &lt; 0.05), and number of pinch/release cycles (r = -0.31, P &lt; 0.05), and positively correlated with the second and third digit sensory discrimination accuracy (r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.05). Therefore, reduced second/third interdigit cortical separation distance in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex was associated with worse symptomatology (particularly paraesthesia), reduced fine motor skill performance, and worse sensory discrimination accuracy for median nerve innervated digits. In conclusion, primary somatosensory cortex neuroplasticity for median nerve innervated digits in carpal tunnel syndrome is indeed maladaptive and underlies the functional deficits seen in these patients.",

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a 275-kb deletion within the cytogenetic band 5q31.1 which contains the H2AFY gene and 190,428bp of its downstream region. The deleted region is upstream to the PITX1 gene. The radiological features in the upper limbs of all affected members of the family were almost identical to the phenotype in the mouse model with ectopic expression of Pitx1 in the forelimbs.

Mast-cell activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of the conditions. AK002 (lirentelimab) is an anti-Siglec-8 antibody that depletes eosinophils and inhibits mast cells and that has shown potential in animal models as a treatment for eosinophilic gastritis and duodenitis. In this phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned adults who had symptomatic eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic duodenitis, or both conditions in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive four monthly infusions of low-dose AK002, high-dose AK002, or placebo. The primary end point was the change in gastrointestinal eosinophil count from baseline to 2 weeks after the final dose; to maximize statistical power, we evaluated this end point in the placebo group as compared with the combined AK002 group. Secondary end points were treatment response (&gt;30% reduction in total symptom score and &gt;75% reduction in gastrointestinal eosinophil count) and the change in total symptom score. Of the 65 patients who underwent randomization, 43 were assigned to receive AK002 and 22 were assigned to receive placebo. The mean percentage change in gastrointestinal eosinophil count was -86% in the combined AK002 group, as compared with 9% in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -98 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -121 to -76; P&lt;0.001). Treatment response occurred in 63% of the patients who received AK002 and in 5% of the patients who received placebo (difference, 58 percentage points; 95% CI, 36 to 74; P&lt;0.001). The mean change in total symptom score was -48% with AK002 and -22% with placebo (least-squares mean difference, -26 percentage points; 95% CI, -44 to -9; P = 0.004). Adverse events associated with AK002 were similar to those with placebo, with the exception of higher percentages of patients having mild-to-moderate infusion-related reactions with AK002 (60% in the combined AK002 group and 23% in the placebo group).

AK002 bound selectively to mast cells, eosinophils and, at a lower level, to basophils in human blood and tissue and not to other cell types examined. AK002 induced apoptosis of interleukin-5-activated blood eosinophils and demonstrated potent ADCC activity against blood eosinophils in the presence of natural killer cells.

Current treatment options, such as diet restriction and corticosteroids, have limited efficacy and are often inappropriate for chronic use. One promising new approach is to deplete eosinophils and inhibit MCs with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 (Siglec-8), an inhibitory receptor selectively expressed on MCs and eosinophils. Here, we characterize MCs and eosinophils from human EG and EoE biopsies using flow cytometry and evaluate the effects of an anti-Siglec-8 mAb using a potentially novel Siglec-8-transgenic mouse model in which EG/EGE was induced by ovalbumin sensitization and intragastric challenge. MCs and eosinophils were significantly increased and activated in human EG and EoE biopsies compared with healthy controls. Similar observations were made in EG/EGE mice. In Siglec-8-transgenic mice, anti-Siglec-8 mAb administration significantly reduced eosinophils and MCs in the stomach, small intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased levels of inflammatory mediators. In summary, these findings suggest a role for both MCs and eosinophils in EGID pathogenesis and support the evaluation of anti-Siglec-8 as a therapeutic approach that targets both eosinophils and MCs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12957828": "Melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine), dubbed the hormone of darkness, is released following a circadian rhythm with high levels at night. It provides circadian and seasonal timing cues through activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in target tissues (1). The discovery of selective melatonin receptor ligands and the creation of mice with targeted disruption of melatonin receptor genes are valuable tools to investigate the localization and functional roles of the receptors in native systems. Here we describe the pharmacological characteristics of melatonin receptor ligands and their various efficacies (agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist), which can vary depending on tissue and cellular milieu. We also review melatonin-mediated responses through activation of melatonin receptors (MT1, MT2, and MT3) highlighting their involvement in modulation of CNS, hypothalamic-hypophyseal-gonadal axis, cardiovascular, and immune functions. For example, activation of the MT1 melatonin receptor inhibits neuronal firing rate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and prolactin secretion from the pars tuberalis and induces vasoconstriction. Activation of the MT2 melatonin receptor phase shifts circadian rhythms generated within the SCN, inhibits dopamine release in the retina, induces vasodilation, enhances splenocyte proliferation and inhibits leukocyte rolling in the microvasculature. Activation of the MT3 melatonin receptor reduces intraocular pressure and inhibits leukotriene B4-induced leukocyte adhesion. We conclude that an accurate characterization of melatonin receptors mediating specific functions in native tissues can only be made using receptor specific ligands, with the understanding that receptor ligands may change efficacy in both native tissues and heterologous expression systems.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12111545": "The pineal hormone, melatonin, is an important regulator of seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythms. Its effects are mediated via high-affinity melatonin receptors, located on cells of the pituitary pars tuberalis (PT) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), respectively. Two subtypes of mammalian melatonin receptors have been cloned and characterized, the MT1 (Mel(1a)) and the MT2 (Mel(1b)) melatonin receptor subtypes. Both subtypes are members of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor family. By using recombinant melatonin receptors it has been shown that the MT1 melatonin receptor is coupled to different G proteins that mediate adenylyl cyclase inhibition and phospholipase C beta activation. The MT2 receptor is also coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and additionally it inhibits the soluble guanylyl cyclase pathway. In mice with a targeted deletion of the MT1 receptor, the acute inhibitory effects of melatonin on SCN multiunit activity are completely abolished, while the phase-shifting responses to melatonin (given in physiological concentrations) appear normal. Furthermore, melatonin inhibits the phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein, induced by the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in SCN cells predominantly via the MT1 receptor. However, a functional MT2 receptor in the rodent SCN is partially able to compensate for the absence of the MT1 receptor in MT1 receptor-deficient mice. These findings indicate redundant and non-redundant roles of the receptor subtypes in regulating SCN function. In the PT, a functional MT1 receptor is essential for the rhythmic synthesis of the clock gene product mPER1. Melatonin produces a long-lasting sensitization of adenylyl cyclase and thus amplifies cyclic AMP signaling when melatonin levels decline at dawn. This action of melatonin amplifies gene expression rhythms in the PT and provides a mechanism for reinforcing rhythmicity in peripheral tissues which themselves lack the capacity for self-sustained oscillation. Mice with targeted deletion of melatonin receptor subtypes provide an excellent model to understand cellular mechanisms through which melatonin modulates circadian and photoperiodic rhythmicity.",

In this study, immunolocalization assay showed that MT1 and MT2 are highly expressed in Leydig cell membrane. To understand the biological function of melatonin receptors in hCG-induced testosterone synthesis, we generated melatonin receptor knockdown cells using specific siRNA and performed testosterone detection after hCG treatment. We found that knockdown of melatonin receptors, especially MTNR1A, led to an obvious decrease (&gt; 60%) of testosterone level. Our further study revealed that knockdown of melatonin receptors repressed expression, at both the mRNA level and the protein level, of key steroidogenic genes, such as p450scc, p450c17 and StAR, which are essential for testosterone synthesis. hCG triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to regulate steroidogenic genes' expression and apoptosis. To further investigate the potential roles of melatonin receptors in hCG-induced regulation of ER stress and apoptosis, we examined expression of some crucial ER stress markers, including Grp78, Chop, ATF4, Xbp1, and IRE1. We found that inhibition of melatonin receptors increased hCG-induced expression of Grp78, Chop and ATF4, but not Xbp1 and IRE1, suggesting that hCG may modulate IRE1 signaling pathways in a melatonin receptor-dependent manner. In addition, our further data showed that knockdown of MTNR1A and MTNR1B promoted hCG-induced expression of apoptosis markers, including p53, caspase-3 and Bcl-2. These results suggested that the melatonin receptors MTNR1A and MTNR1B are essential to repress hCG-induced ER stress and cell apoptosis.

Because of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of HPE, patients carrying defined mutations may not manifest the disease at all, or have a spectrum of defects. It is currently unknown what drives manifestation of HPE in genetically at-risk individuals, but it has been speculated that other gene mutations and environmental factors may combine as cumulative insults. HPE can be diagnosed in utero by a high-resolution prenatal ultrasound or a fetal magnetic resonance imaging, sometimes in combination with molecular testing from chorionic villi or amniotic fluid sampling.

Furthermore, we explore potential implications of miR-9-mediated regulation of Notch/Hes1 signaling with regard to neural progenitor homeostasis, patterning, timing of differentiation and tumor formation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583034": "In the adult mammalian brain niches for neural stem cells are maintained, which enable a steady-state neurogenesis. This process is tightly regulated by multiple niche factors, including Notch and NF-\u03baB signaling. The NF-\u03baB-activating-protein (NKAP) has previously been shown to act as Notch co-repressor component by binding CIR and recruiting HDAC3 in T-cell development and furthermore to regulate NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription. Here, we provide first evidence for the expression of NKAP in neurogenic cells of the adult mammalian brain. NKAP is highly expressed in Mash1(+) transit amplifying cells and PSA-NCAM(+) migrating neuroblasts throughout the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the rostral migratory stream (RMS), as well as in the hippocampus. We further show that NKAP expression levels are downregulated during the course of the RMS. Eventually, most differentiated cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) and the corpus callosum only display low levels of NKAP expression. Finally, large subsets of mature neurons in the OB, the hippocampus and the thalamus express NKAP at high levels, suggesting an additional role of NKAP outside of SVZ progenitor cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19783418": "In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells.",

Using neural progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult rat subjected to focal cerebral ischemia, we investigated the Notch pathway in regulating proliferation and differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells after stroke. During proliferation of neural progenitor cells, ischemic neural progenitor cells exhibited substantially increased levels of Notch, Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and hairy enhancer of split (Hes) 1, which was associated with a significant increase of proliferating cells. Blockage of the Notch pathway by short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) against Notch or a gamma secretase inhibitor significantly reduced Notch, NICD and Hes1 expression and cell proliferation induced by stroke. During differentiation of neural progenitor cells, Notch and Hes1 expression was downregulated in ischemic neural progenitor cells, which was coincident with a significant increase of neuronal population. Inhibition of the Notch pathway with a gamma secretase inhibitor further substantially increased neurons, but did not alter astrocyte population in ischemic neural progenitor cells. These data suggest that the Notch signaling pathway mediates adult SVZ neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation after stroke.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18000541": "A complete account of the whole developmental process of neurogenesis involves understanding a number of complex underlying molecular processes. Among them, those that govern the crucial transition from proliferative (self-replicating) to neurogenic neural progenitor (NP) cells remain largely unknown. Due to its sequential rostro-caudal gradients of proliferation and neurogenesis, the prospective spinal cord of the chick embryo is a good experimental system to study this issue. We report that the NOTCH ligand DELTA-1 is expressed in scattered cycling NP cells in the prospective chick spinal cord preceding the onset of neurogenesis. These Delta-1-expressing progenitors are placed in between the proliferating caudal neural plate (stem zone) and the rostral neurogenic zone (NZ) where neurons are born. Thus, these Delta-1-expressing progenitors define a proliferation to neurogenesis transition zone (PNTZ). Gain and loss of function experiments carried by electroporation demonstrate that the expression of Delta-1 in individual progenitors of the PNTZ is necessary and sufficient to induce neuronal generation. The activation of NOTCH signalling by DELTA-1 in the adjacent progenitors inhibits neurogenesis and is required to maintain proliferation. However, rather than inducing cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation by a typical lateral inhibition mechanism as in the NZ, DELTA-1/NOTCH signalling functions in a distinct manner in the PNTZ. Thus, the inhibition of NOTCH signalling arrests proliferation but it is not sufficient to elicit neuronal differentiation. Moreover, after the expression of Delta-1 PNTZ NP continue cycling and induce the expression of Tis21, a gene that is upregulated in neurogenic progenitors, before generating neurons. Together, these experiments unravel a novel function of DELTA-NOTCH signalling that regulates the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis in NP cells. We hypothesize that this novel function is evolutionary conserved.",

Here we investigate the role of Notch signaling in apoptotic cell death of neural progenitors through the generation and analysis of cell type-specific conditional transgenic and knockout mice. We show that conditional expression of a constitutively active form of Notch1 in early neural progenitor cells, but not postmitotic neurons, selectively induces extensive apoptosis, resulting in a markedly reduced progenitor population. Conversely, attenuation of Notch signaling in Notch1 conditional knockout or Presenilin-1-/- mice results in reduced apoptosis of early neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, Notch activation in neural progenitor cells leads to elevated levels of nuclear p53 and transcriptional upregulation of the target genes Bax and Noxa, and the promotion of apoptotic cell death by Notch activation is completely suppressed by p53 deficiency. Together, these complementary gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies reveal a previously unappreciated role of Notch signaling in the regulation of apoptotic cell death during early mammalian neural development.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18956012": "In the developing mammalian nervous system, neural progenitor cells first express the Notch effector Hes1 at variable levels and then proneural genes and Notch ligands in salt-and-pepper patterns. Recent real-time imaging analysis indicates that Hes1 expression in these cells oscillates with a period of about 2-3 h. Furthermore, the proneural gene Neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) and the Notch ligand gene Deltalike-1 (Dll1) are expressed cyclically in neural progenitor cells under the control of Hes1 oscillation but are expressed continuously in postmitotic neurons, which lose Hes1 expression. Hes1-driven Ngn2 and Dll1 oscillations seem to be advantageous for maintenance of a group of cells in an undifferentiated state by mutual activation of Notch signaling. This dynamic mode of gene expression would require a revision of the traditional view of how Notch-mediated lateral inhibition operates in the developing mammalian nervous system.",

Regulation of Notch receptor levels in membrane compartments has been shown to affect signaling in a variety of contexts. Here we used steady-state and pulse-labeling techniques to follow Notch receptors in sensory organ precursor cells in Drosophila. We find that the endosomal adaptor protein Numb regulates levels of Notch receptor trafficking to Rab7-labeled late endosomes but not early endosomes. Using an assay we developed that labels different pools of Notch receptors as they move through the endocytic system, we show that Numb specifically suppresses a recycled Notch receptor subpopulation and that excess Notch signaling in numb mutants requires the recycling endosome GTPase Rab11 activity. Our data therefore suggest that Numb controls the balance between Notch receptor recycling and receptor targeting to late endosomes to regulate signaling output after asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neural progenitors.",

Studies of the mechanisms controlling the fine balance between neural stem cells and more differentiated progenitors have shown that, in every asymmetric cell division, progenitors send a Delta-Notch signal to their sibling stem cells. Here, we show that excessive activation of Notch or overexpression of its direct targets of the Hes family causes stem-cell hyperplasias in the <i>Drosophila</i> larval central nervous system, which can progress to malignant tumours after allografting to adult hosts. We combined transcriptomic data from these hyperplasias with chromatin occupancy data for Dpn, a Hes transcription factor, to identify genes regulated by Hes factors in this process. We show that the Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes. These are excluded from the stem cells and promote early differentiation steps, most likely by preventing the reversion of immature progenitors to a stem-cell fate. We describe the impact of two of these 'anti-stemness' factors, Zfh1 and Gcm, on Notch/Hes-triggered tumorigenesis.",

Numb is an inhibitor of Notch activity; thus, this mechanism forms a regulatory feedback loop to control asymmetric cytokinesis and differentiation.",

This phase I, nonrandomized, open-label multiple-dose study evaluated pexidartinib safety and efficacy in Asian patients with symptomatic, advanced solid tumors. Materials and Methods Patients received pexidartinib: cohort 1, 600 mg/d; cohort 2, 1000 mg/d for 2 weeks, then 800 mg/d. Primary objectives assessed pexidartinib safety and tolerability, and determined the recommended phase 2 dose; secondary objectives evaluated efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile. Results All 11 patients (6 males, 5 females; median age 64, range 23-82; cohort 1 n = 3; cohort 2 n = 8) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event; 5 experienced at least one grade \u2265 3 adverse event, most commonly (18%) for each of the following: increased aspartate aminotransferase, blood alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and anemia. Recommended phase 2 dose was 1000 mg/d for 2 weeks and 800 mg/d thereafter. Pexidartinib exposure, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 8 h (AUC<sub>0-8h</sub>), and maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) increased on days 1 and 15 with increasing pexidartinib doses, and time at C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) was consistent throughout all doses.

A Ten-week-old mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and then treated with PLX3397 via oral gavage (50 mg/kg) every second day for 3 weeks, with subsequent monitoring of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and assessment of adipose tissue immune cells. PLX3397 treatment substantially reduced macrophage numbers in adipose tissue of both chow and high-fat diet fed mice without affecting total myeloid cell levels. Despite this, PLX3397 did not greatly alter glucose homeostasis, did not affect high-fat diet-induced increases in visceral fat cytokine expression (Il-6 and Tnfa) and had limited effect on the phosphorylation of the stress kinases JNK and ERK and macrophage polarization.

The US FDA approved four small molecule protein kinase antagonists in 2019; these include entrectinib, erdafitinib, pexidartinib, and fedratinib. Entrectinib binds to TRKA/B/C and ROS1 and is prescribed for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK fusion proteins and for ROS1-postive non-small cell lung cancers. Erdafitinib inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4 and is used in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancers. Pexidartinib is a CSF1R antagonist that is prescribed for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumors. Fedratinib blocks JAK2 and is used in the treatment of myelofibrosis. Overall, the US FDA has approved 52 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of temsirolimus (which is given intravenously) and netarsudil (an eye drop). Of the 52 approved drugs, eleven inhibit protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, two are directed against dual specificity protein kinases, eleven target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 28 block receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 46 of these drugs are used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases (eight against non-solid tumors such as leukemias and 41 against solid tumors including breast and lung cancers; some drugs are used against both tumor types). Eight drugs are employed in the treatment of non-malignancies: fedratinib, myelofibrosis; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; netarsudil, glaucoma; and tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, sirolimus and ibrutinib are used for the treatment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Entrectinib and larotrectinib are tissue-agnostic anti-cancer small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. These drugs are prescribed for the treatment of any solid cancer harboring NTRK1/2/3 fusion proteins regardless of the organ, tissue, anatomical location, or histology type. Of the 52 approved drugs, seventeen are used in the treatment of more than one disease. Imatinib, for example, is approved for the treatment of eight disparate disorders. The most common drug targets of the approved pharmaceuticals include BCR-Abl, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), and ALK. Most of the approved small molecule protein kinase antagonists (49) bind to the protein kinase domain and six of them bind covalently. In contrast, everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus are larger molecules (MW \u2248 1000) that bind to FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase complex. This review presents the physicochemical properties of all of the FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. Twenty-two of the 52 drugs have molecular weights greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular weight of the approved drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib).

The current standard of care for TGCT is surgical resection. However, some patients have tumor recurrence, present with unresectable tumors, or have tumors that are in locations where resection could result in amputations or significant debility. Therefore, the development of systemic agents with activity against TGCT to expand treatment options is a highly unmet medical need. Pathologically, TGCT is characterized by the overexpression of colony\ufeff-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), which leads to the recruitment of colony\ufeff-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) expressing macrophages that make up the primary cell type within these giant cell tumors. The binding of CSF-1 and CSF-1R controls cell survival and proliferation of monocytes and the switch from a monocytic to macrophage phenotype contributing to the growth and inflammation within these tumors. Therefore, molecules that target CSF-1/CSF-1R have emerged as potential systemic agents for the treatment of TGCT. Given the role of macrophages in regulating tumorigenesis, CSF1/CSF1R-targeting agents have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets for solid tumors. Pexidartinib is an orally bioavailable and potent inhibitor of CSF-1R which is one of the most clinically used agents. In this review, we discuss the biology of TGCT and review the pre-clinical and clinical development of pexidartinib which ultimately led to the FDA approval of this agent for the treatment of TGCT as well as ongoing clinical studies utilizing pexidartinib in the setting of cancer.",

MD simulation indicated (-)-kusunokinin and pexidartinib (P31, a specific CSF1R binding compound) shared some extents of functional similarity in which (-)-kusunokinin bound CSF1R at the juxtamembrane (JM) region with aromatic amino acids similar to pexidartinib using \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, as well as hydrogen bond. Both P31 and (-)-kusunokinin moved into the same CSF1R region and W7 was a mutual key residue. However, the P31 binding site differed from the (-)-kusunokinin binding site. For in vitro study, the synthetic (\u00b1)-kusunokinin exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than picropodophyllotoxin, silibinin and etoposide on MCF-7 cells and represented less toxicity than picropodophyllotoxin and doxorubicin on L-929 and MCF-12A cells. Knocking down CSF1R using a specific siRNA combination with (\u00b1)-kusunokinin demonstrated levels of cell proliferation proteins slightly higher than siRNA-CSF1R treatment. However, siRNA-CSF1R combination with P31 represented the number of cell viability and cell proliferation proteins, like in the control groups (Lipofectamine and siRNA-Luciferase). Moreover, (\u00b1)-kusunokinin suppressed CSF1R and its downstream proteins, including AKT, CyclinD1 and CDK1. Meanwhile, both P31 and siRNA-CSF1R dramatically suppressed CSF1R, MEK1, AKT, ERK, CyclinB1, CyclinD1 and CDK1. Our overall results indicate that the mechanism of (\u00b1)-kusunokinin differed fairly from P31. We have concluded that (\u00b1)-kusunokinin inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation partially through the binding and suppression of CSF1R, which consequently affected AKT and its downstream molecules.",

Surgery is standard with no approved systemic therapy. We aimed to evaluate pexidartinib, a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, in patients with TGCT to provide them with a viable systemic treatment option, especially in cases that are not amenable to surgical resection. This phase 3 randomised trial had two parts. Part one was a double-blind study in which patients with symptomatic, advanced TGCT for whom surgery was not recommended were randomly assigned via an integrated web response system (1:1) to the pexidartinib or placebo group. Individuals in the pexidartinib group received a loading dose of 1000 mg pexidartinib per day orally (400 mg morning; 600 mg evening) for the first 2 weeks, followed by 800 mg per day (400 mg twice a day) for 22 weeks. Part two was an open-label study of pexidartinib for all patients. The primary endpoint, assessed in all intention-to-treat patients, was overall response at week 25, and was centrally reviewed by RECIST, version 1.1. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.

There were 11 dropouts in the placebo group and nine in the pexidartinib group. Emergence of mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity caused the data monitoring committee to stop enrolment six patients short of target. The proportion of patients who achieved overall response was higher for pexidartinib than placebo at week 25 by RECIST (24 [39%] of 61 vs none of 59; absolute difference 39% [95% CI 27-53]; p&lt;0\u00b70001). Serious adverse events occurred in eight (13%) of 61 patients in the pexidartinib group and one (2%) of 59 patients in the placebo group. Hair colour changes (67%), fatigue (54%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (39%), nausea (38%), alanine aminotransferase increase (28%), and dysgeusia (25%) were the most frequent pexidartinib-associated adverse events. Three patients given pexidartinib had aminotransferase elevations three or more times the upper limit of normal with total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase two or more times the upper limit of normal indicative of mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity, one lasting 7 months and confirmed by biopsy. Pexidartinib is the first systemic therapy to show a robust tumour response in TGCT with improved patient symptoms and functional outcomes; mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity is an identified risk.

With increasing antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, alternate therapies are being developed to target toxin pore formation rather than the bacteria themselves. One strategy is to undermine the stability of these multimeric pores, whose subunits are held together by complex amino acid interaction networks, by identifying key residues in these networks which could be plausible drug or mutagenesis targets. However, this requires a quantitative assessment of per residue contributions towards pore stability, which cannot be reliably gleaned from static crystal/cryo-EM pore structures. In this study, we overcome this limitation by developing a computational screening algorithm that employs fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations coupled with energy-based screening that can predict 'hot-spot' residues which engage in persistent and stabilizing hydrogen bonds or salt bridges across protein-protein interfaces. Application of this algorithm to prototypical <i>\u03b1</i>-PFT (cytolysin A) and <i>\u03b2</i>-PFT (<i>\u03b1</i>-hemolysin) membrane-inserted pores yielded a small predicted set of highly interacting residues, blocking of which could destabilize pore complexes. Previous mutagenesis studies validate some of our <i>in silico</i> predictions.

Cardiomyocyte death and heart damage was due to pneumolysin-mediated necroptosis. IPD leads to long-term cardiac damage, as evidenced by de novo collagen deposition in mouse hearts and a decrease in fractional shortening. Adjunct necroptosis inhibition reduced the number of S. pneumoniae foci observed in hearts of acutely infected mice and serum levels of troponin I.

Two such disorders, CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, result from loss of function mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7<sup>LOF</sup>) and lysine (K) methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D<sup>LOF</sup>), respectively. Although these two syndromes are clinically distinct, there is significant phenotypic overlap. We therefore expected that epigenetically driven developmental pathways regulated by CHD7 and KMT2D would overlap and that DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations downstream of the mutations in these genes would identify common target genes, elucidating a mechanistic link between these two conditions, as well as specific target genes for each disorder. Genome-wide DNAm profiles in individuals with CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes with CHD7<sup>LOF</sup> or KMT2D<sup>LOF</sup> identified distinct sets of DNAm differences in each of the disorders, which were used to generate two unique, highly specific and sensitive DNAm signatures. These DNAm signatures were able to differentiate pathogenic mutations in these two genes from controls and from each other. Analysis of the DNAm targets in each gene-specific signature identified both common gene targets, including homeobox A5 (HOXA5), which could account for some of the clinical overlap in CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, as well as distinct gene targets. Our findings demonstrate how characterization of the epigenome can contribute to our understanding of disease pathophysiology for epigenetic disorders, paving the way for explorations of novel therapeutics.",

In particular, it targets histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), whose methylations serve as a gene activation mark. Recently, KMT2D has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated genes in a variety of cancers and in other human diseases, including lymphoma, medulloblastoma, gastric cancer, and Kabuki syndrome. Mutations in KMT2D identified thus far point to its loss-of-function in pathogenesis and suggest its role as a tumor suppressor in various tissues. To determine the effect of a KMT2D deficiency on neoplastic cells, we used homologous recombination- and nuclease-mediated gene editing approaches to generate a panel of isogenic colorectal and medulloblastoma cancer cell lines that differ with respect to their endogenous KMT2D status. We found that a KMT2D deficiency resulted in attenuated cancer cell proliferation and defective cell migration. Analysis of histone H3 modifications revealed that KMT2D was essential for maintaining the level of global H3K4 monomethylation and that its enzymatic SET domain was directly responsible for this function. Furthermore, we found that a majority of KMT2D binding sites are located in regions of potential enhancer elements. Together, these findings revealed the role of KMT2D in regulating enhancer elements in human cells and shed light on the tumorigenic role of its deficiency. Our study supports that KMT2D has distinct roles in neoplastic cells, as opposed to normal cells, and that inhibiting KMT2D may be a viable strategy for cancer therapeutics.",

Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of ion transport and cell cycle genes, leading to altered calcium handling and cell cycle defects. We further determined that myocardial Kmt2d deletion led to decreased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 at enhancers and promoters. Finally, we identified KMT2D-bound regions in cardiomyocytes, of which a subset was associated with decreased gene expression and decreased H3K4me2 in mutant hearts. This subset included genes related to ion transport, hypoxia-reoxygenation and cell cycle regulation, suggesting that KMT2D is important for these processes.

Here, we report a patient, who was initially diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome based on the spectrum of inner organ malformations like choanal hypoplasia, heart defect, anal atresia, vision problems and conductive hearing impairment. While sequencing and MLPA analysis of all coding exons of CHD7 revealed no pathogenic mutation, sequence analysis of the KMT2D gene identified the heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation c.5263C &gt; T (p.Gln1755*). Thus, our patient was diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome. By using co-immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry and direct yeast two hybrid assays, we could show that, like KMT2D, CHD7 interacts with members of the WAR complex, namely WDR5, ASH2L and RbBP5.

It is characterized by a typical facial gestalt in combination with short stature, intellectual disability, skeletal findings and additional features like cardiac and urogenital malformations, cleft palate, hearing loss and ophthalmological anomalies. The major cause of Kabuki syndrome are mutations in KMT2D, a gene encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase belonging to the group of chromatin modifiers. Here we provide evidence that Kabuki syndrome is a neurocrestopathy, by showing that Kmt2d loss-of-function inhibits specific steps of neural crest (NC) development. Using the Xenopus model system, we find that Kmt2d loss-of-function recapitulates major features of Kabuki syndrome including severe craniofacial malformations. A detailed marker analysis revealed defects in NC formation as well as migration. Transplantation experiments confirm that Kmt2d function is required in NC cells. Furthermore, analyzing in vivo and in vitro NC migration behavior demonstrates that Kmt2d is necessary for cell dispersion but not protrusion formation of migrating NC cells. Importantly, Kmt2d knockdown correlates with a decrease in H3K4 monomethylation and H3K27 acetylation supporting a role of Kmt2d in the transcriptional activation of target genes. Consistently, using a candidate approach, we find that Kmt2d loss-of-function inhibits Xenopus Sema3F expression, and overexpression of Sema3F can partially rescue Kmt2d loss-of-function defects. Taken together, our data reveal novel functions of Kmt2d in multiple steps of NC development and support the hypothesis that major features of Kabuki syndrome are caused by defects in NC development.",

Mutations with a loss-of-function in the KMT2D gene on chromosome 12 in humans are responsible for Kabuki syndrome (KS). Phenotypic characterization of the bapa mutant was performed using a behavioral test battery to evaluate the parameters related to general activity, the sensory nervous system, the psychomotor system, and the autonomous nervous system, as well as to measure motor function and spatial memory. Relative to BALB/cJ mice, the bapa mutant showed sensory and psychomotor impairments, such as hypotonia denoted by a surface righting reflex impairment and hindquarter fall, and a reduction in the auricular reflex, suggesting hearing impairment. Additionally, the enhanced general activity showed by the increased rearing and grooming frequency, distance traveled and average speed possibly presupposes the presence of hyperactivity of bapa mice compared with the control group. A slight motor coordination dysfunction was showed in bapa mice, which had a longer crossing time on the balance beam compared with BALB/cJ controls. Male bapa mice also showed spatial gait pattern changes, such as a shorter stride length and shorter step length.

Mutations in the histone H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D have been identified as the main cause of Kabuki syndrome, however, the role of KMT2D in heart development remains to be characterized. Here we analyze the function of Kmt2d at different stages of Xenopus heart development. Xenopus Kmt2d is ubiquitously expressed at early stages of cardiogenesis, with enrichment in the anterior region including the cardiac precursor cells. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Kmt2d led to hypoplastic hearts lacking the three-chambered structure. Analyzing different stages of cardiogenesis revealed that development of the first and second heart fields as well as cardiac differentiation were severely affected by loss of Kmt2d function. Kmt2d loss of function in Xenopus recapitulates the hypoplastic heart defects observed in Kabuki syndrome patients and shows that Kmt2d function is required for the establishment of the primary and secondary heart fields. Thus, Xenopus Kmt2d morphants can be a valuable tool to elucidate the etiology of the congenital heart defects associated with Kabuki syndrome.",

We have described the isolation of a human 5 alpha-reductase complementary DNA from prostate. Subsequent cloning and genetic studies showed that this gene (designated 5 alpha-reductase 1) was normal in patients with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. We report here the isolation of a second 5 alpha-reductase cDNA by expression cloning and the polymerase chain reaction. The biochemical and pharmacological properties of this cDNA-encoded enzyme (designated 5 alpha-reductase 2) are consistent with it being the major isozyme in genital tissue. A deletion in this gene is present in two related individuals with male pseudohermaphroditism caused by 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. These results verify the existence of at least two 5 alpha-reductases in man and provide insight into a fundamental hormone-mediated event in male sexual differentiation.",

All of the serum hormone profiles were normal except for raised serum total testosterone. Testosterone to DHT ratio (T/DHT) was elevated before (15.72) and further increased after hCG stimulation (32.46). A chromosomal study revealed a 46,XY karyotype. A bilateral gonadectomy, recessive cliteroplasty, urethroplasty, and vaginoplasty were performed and hormonal replacement therapy using estrogen was started.

Semen analysis and testicular histology revealed maturation arrest of spermatogenesis, with low sperm count and motility. Determination of urinary 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reduced adrenal steroids enabled us to diagnose the disease in a male patient with the full-blown clinical syndrome, in another male patient who had undergone bilateral orchidectomy, and in three female individuals with the biochemical derangement. The female patients were unique in this family with respect to their low degree of virilization, but had normal menstrual cycles. Molecular genetic studies were performed on DNA extracted from peripheral leukocytes and from cultured genital skin fibroblasts. The coding sequence of the 5 alpha R2 gene (SRD5A2) was studied by exon-specific PCR, single strand conformation polymorphism, and direct sequencing.

One substrate for this membrane-bound enzyme is testosterone, whose reduction to dihydrotestosterone is required for the embryonic differentiation of the external male genitalia and prostate. There are two 5 alpha-reductase isozymes, designated types 1 and 2, which have different biochemical and pharmacological properties. Inherited deficiencies of 5 alpha-reductase type 2 result in a form of male pseudohermaphroditism in which the external genitalia fail to develop normally. Here, nine additional mutations in the 5 alpha-reductase 2 gene in subjects with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency are described. The biochemical consequences of these mutations, as well as 13 previously identified missense mutations, were characterized by recreating the mutations in an expressible cDNA and transfecting into mammalian cells. Twelve of the 22 mutations inactivated the enzyme. The remaining 10 mutations impaired enzyme function by affecting either substrate or cofactor binding. Almost all mutations decreased the half-life of the protein, and all but one of the impaired enzymes had an altered pH optimum. The mutations provide insight into functional domains in the protein as well as an unusual acidic pH optimum characteristic of the 5 alpha-reductase type 2 isozyme.",

This paper describes the population exposure-response (E-R) modeling and simulations, which were used to inform the phase III dose-selection rationale, based on ~ 800 participants pooled across two phase IIb randomized dose-finding clinical trials. The E-R model describes the placebo and ubrogepant treatment effects based on migraine pain end points (2-hour pain relief and 2-hour pain freedom) at various dose levels. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate various assumptions of placebo response in light of the high placebo response observed in one phase II trial. A population pharmacokinetic model describing the effect of formulations was included in the E-R simulation framework to assess potential dose implications of a formulation switch from phase II to phase III. Model-based simulations predict that a dose of 25 mg or higher is likely to achieve significantly better efficacy than placebo with desirable efficacy levels. The understanding of E-R helped support the dose selection for the phase III clinical trials.",

The CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant, also known as MK-1602, has been recently evaluated in phase III clinical trials for clinical efficacy and long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.",

Ubrogepant is the first oral CGRP receptor antagonist approved for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP is an important key mediator of migraine pain; CGRP levels have been shown to be significantly higher during a migraine attack. Two pivotal phase III clinical trials (ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II) demonstrated effectiveness and safety of ubrogepant in acute migraine attacks. Ubrogepant can be administered as 50- and 100-mg tablets, with a maximum dose of 200 mg within 48 h. Besides minimizing pain, the drug is equally effective in alleviating migraine-associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia and sound sensitivity. Unlike other gepants, ubrogepant is free from hepatotoxicity at the therapeutic doses. In certain cases (1 in 5), a full relief of pain was achieved with a single dose of the drug.

We have identified a 32-nucleotide conserved noncoding element (CNE) as HOTAIR ancient sequence that likely originated at the root of vertebrate. The second round of whole-genome duplication resulted in one copy of the CNE within HOTAIR and another copy embedded in noncoding transcript of HOXD11. Paralogous CNEs underwent compensatory mutations, exhibit sequence complementarity with respect to transcripts directionality, and have high affinity in vitro. The HOTAIR CNE resembled a poised enhancer in stem cells and an active enhancer in HOTAIR-expressing cells. HOTAIR expression is positively correlated with HOXC11 in cis and negatively correlated with HOXD11 in trans. We propose a dual modality of HOTAIR regulation where transcription of HOTAIR and its embedded enhancer regulates HOXC11 in cis and sequence complementarity between paralogous CNEs suggests HOXD11 regulation in trans.",

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) largely contributes to night sleep disruption and narcolepsy is the most common cause of secondary RBD. However, RBD linked to narcolepsy (N-RBD) has been insufficiently characterized, leaving unsolved a number of issues. Indeed, it is still debated whether N-RBD is an intrinsic feature of narcolepsy, as indubitable for cataplexy, and therefore strictly linked to the cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 (CSF hcrt-1) deficiency, or an associated feature, with a still unclear pathophysiology. The current review aims at rendering a comprehensive state-of-the-art of N-RBD, highlighting the open and unsettled topics. RBD reportedly affects 30-60% of patients with Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), but it may be seen also in Narcolepsy type 2 (NT2). When compared to idiopathic/isolated RBD (iRBD), N-RBD has been reported to be characterized by less energetic and quieter episode, which however occur with the same probability in the first and the second part of the night and sometime even subcontinuously. N-RBD patients are generally younger than those with iRBD. N-RBD has been putatively linked to wake-sleep instability due to CSF hcrt-1 deficiency, but this latter by itself cannot explain completely the phenomenon as N-RBD has not been universally linked to low CSF hcrt-1 levels and it may be observed also in NT2. Therefore, other factors may probably play a role and further studies are needed to clarify this issue. In addition, therapeutic options have been poorly investigated.",

There is no curative therapy for narcolepsy. Treatment is therefore symptom directed. Symptom management is generally directed at improving excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, and cataplexy. First-line treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness is typically daily use of wake-promoting agents, such as modafinil or armodafinil, or stimulant therapy, such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. Alternatively, sodium oxybate can be used nightly for improved cataplexy, sleep consolidation, and following day wakefulness. These therapies can be limited in some patients because of inadequate efficacy, poor tolerability, or side effects. We describe five narcolepsy patients with severe excessive daytime sleepiness who had an inadequate response or experienced side effects with the initial therapies but had a positive response to treatment with baclofen. These patients reported subjective improvement in sleep maintenance without fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. Average Epworth Sleepiness Scale assessment before treatment was 15.8 with post-treatment assessment being 10.4 (P &lt; 0.05).

Of the seven scales reviewed, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale continues to be an important outcome measure to screen adults for excessive daytime sleepiness, which may be associated with narcolepsy. Several narcolepsy-specific scales have demonstrated utility, such as the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale, Swiss Narcolepsy Scale, and Narcolepsy Symptom Assessment Questionnaire, but further validation is required.

The human Clec11a gene encodes a polypeptide of 323 amino acids with characteristics of a secreted glycoprotein encompassing two integrin-binding motifs, RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) and LDT (Leu-Asp-Thr), a putative leucine zipper domain, and a functional C-type lectin domain. It regulates hematopoietic differentiation and homeostasis and exhibits a protective effect against severe malarial anemia and lipotoxicity. Furthermore, Clec11a promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into mature osteoblasts in vitro and plays an important role in the maintenance of adult skeleton age-related bone loss and fracture repair. Receptor ligand binding results in activation of downstream signaling cascades including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), \u03b2-catenin, and Wnt, resulting in the expression of osteoblast-related gene transcripts including Alp, Runx2, Lef1, and Axin2. In addition, Clec11a is also associated with the development of several cancers, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and gastrointestinal tract tumors. To date, however, the mechanisms governing transcription regulation of the Clec11a gene are not known and remain to be uncovered.

Here, we show that fibroblast activation protein (Fap), a serine protease inhibited by the bone growth factor Osteolectin, is an osteogenic suppressor. Genetic deletion of Fap significantly ameliorates limb trabecular bone loss during aging. Pharmacological inhibition of Fap significantly promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption in wild-type mice by differentially regulating canonical Wnt and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of Fap promotes osteoblast differentiation, inhibits osteoclast differentiation, and significantly attenuates osteoporosis in ovariectomized mice. Epistasis analyses in zebrafish show that Osteolectin functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Fap to promote vertebrae mineralization. Taken together, we identify Fap as an important osteogenic suppressor and a potential drug target to treat osteoporosis.",

We reviewed a prospectively obtained ECMO database and patients' medical records between January 2005 and June 2011. Demographic characteristics, illness severity at admission, ECMO indication, organ failure scores before ECMO and the ECMO mode and configuration were recorded. Bleeding, neurological, vascular and infectious complications that occurred on ECMO were also collected. Demographic, illness, ECMO support descriptors and complications associated with hospital mortality were analysed. ECMO was initiated 158 times in 151 patients. VA ECMO (66.5%) was twice as common as VV ECMO (33.5%) with a median duration significantly shorter than for VV ECMO (7 days (first and third quartiles: 5; 10 days) versus 10 days (first and third quartiles: 6; 16 days)).

Haemorrhagic events, assessed by the total of red blood cell units received during ECMO, were associated with hospital mortality for both ECMO types. Among neurologic, vascular, infectious and bleeding events that occurred on ECMO, bleeding was the most frequent and had a significant impact on mortality.

Mechanical emergencies on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have an associated mortality of 25%. Thus, acquiring and maintaining the technical, behavioral, and critical thinking skills necessary to manage ECMO emergencies is essential to patient survival. Traditional training in ECMO management is primarily didactic in nature and usually complemented with varying degrees of hands-on training using a water-filled ECMO circuit. These traditional training methods do not provide an opportunity for trainees to recognize and interpret real-time clinical cues generated by human patients and their monitoring equipment. Adult learners are most likely to acquire such skills in an active learning environment. To provide authentic, intensive, interactive ECMO training without risk to real patients, we used methodologies pioneered by the aerospace industry and our experience developing a simulation-based training program in neonatal resuscitation to develop a similar simulation-based training program in ECMO crisis management, ECMO Sim. A survey was conducted at the 19th Annual Children's National Medical Center ECMO Symposium to determine current methods for ECMO training. Using commercially available technology, we linked a neonatal manikin with a standard neonatal ECMO circuit primed with artificial blood. Both the manikin and circuit were placed in a simulated neonatal intensive care unit environment equipped with remotely controlled monitors, real medical equipment and human colleagues. Twenty-five healthcare professionals, all of whom care for patients on ECMO and who underwent traditional ECMO training in the prior year, participated in a series of simulated ECMO emergencies. At the conclusion of the program, subjects completed a questionnaire qualitatively comparing ECMO Sim with their previous traditional ECMO training experience. The amount of time spent engaged in active and passive activities during both ECMO Sim and traditional ECMO training was quantified by review of videotape of each program. Hospitals currently use lectures, multiple-choice exams, water drills, and animal laboratory testing for their ECMO training. Modification of the circuit allowed for physiologically appropriate circuit pressures (both pre- and postoxygenator) to be achieved while circulating artificial blood continuously through the circuit and manikin. Realistic changes in vital signs on the bedside monitor and fluctuations in the mixed venous oxygen saturation monitor were also effectively achieved remotely. All subjects rated the realism of the scenarios as good or excellent and described ECMO Sim as more effective than traditional ECMO training. They reported that ECMO Sim engaged their intellect to a greater degree and better developed their technical, behavioral, and critical thinking skills. Active learning (eg, hands-on activities) comprised 78% of the total ECMO Sim program compared with 14% for traditional ECMO training (P &lt; 0.001). Instructor-led lectures predominated in traditional ECMO training. Traditional ECMO training programs have yet to incorporate simulation-based methodology. Using current technology it is possible to realistically simulate in real-time the clinical cues (visual, auditory, and tactile) generated by a patient on ECMO. ECMO Sim as a training program provides more opportunities for active learning than traditional training programs in ECMO management and is overwhelmingly preferred by the experienced healthcare professionals serving as subjects in this study. Subjects also indicated that they felt that the acquisition of key cognitive, technical, and behavioral skills and transfer of those skills to the real medical domain was better achieved during simulation-based training.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of this approach by evaluating the rate of return to ECMO after repair. The CDH Study Group database was used to analyze CDH patients requiring ECMO support. The primary outcome was return to ECMO within 72 h of CDH repair among those repaired following ECMO decannulation (\"post-ECMO\" patients). Secondary outcomes were death within 72 h of repair and cumulative death and return to ECMO rate. A total of 668 patients were repaired post-ECMO decannulation. Six patients (0.9%) in the post-ECMO group required return to ECMO within 72 h of surgery and a total of 19 (2.8%) died or returned to ECMO within 72 h of surgery. The rate of return to ECMO and death following CDH repair is extremely low and does not justify the risks inherent to \"on-ECMO\" repair.

A total of 1141 patients who received ECMO after cardiac surgery between 2000 and 2011 were identified by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. For each patient, we matched 5 non-ECMO patients who had undergone cardiac surgery by using propensity scores calculated for age, sex, 12 comorbid diseases, Charlson score, hospital level, type of cardiac surgery, and year of index hospitalization. The outcomes included all-cause mortality, readmission for any cause, and medical expenditure. The incidence of ECMO use after cardiac surgery in Taiwan was 1.91%. The ECMO group had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality than did the non-ECMO group (61.7% vs 6.8%, odds ratio 22.34, 95% confidence interval 19.06-26.18). The risks of all-cause mortality and first readmission for any cause were greater in the ECMO group than that in the control group (P &lt; .001, P &lt; .001) in the first year, whereas no difference was observed after the first year of follow-up (P = .209, P = .474). Similar results were observed regarding the medical expenditure of admission after index admission discharge. Patients receiving ECMO for PCS had similar outcomes to those of the non-ECMO group after the first year of follow-up despite significantly poor outcomes during the in-hospital course.",

Potential indications of the technique in this setting are discussed. Major technological improvements in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines and the positive results of the conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR) trial have reignited interest in VV-ECMO in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent hypoxemia or hypercarbia on conventional mechanical ventilation. The technique has also been successfully used as a rescue therapy for the most severe ARDS cases associated with the recent Influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. However, as the CESAR study was criticized for methodological limitations and because results of nonrandomized case-series of ECMO are prone to selection biases, indications for VV-ECMO remain highly controversial. Before widespread diffusion of VV-ECMO for severe ARDS, new trials should test the efficacy of early initiation of the technique with tight control of mechanical ventilation in the control group, initiation of ECMO prior to transportation to ECMO centers, and the use of ECMO in every patient randomly assigned to receive it.",

The use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the adult patient has increased slowly since the first reported successful treatment in 1972 (Hill et al., 1972) and is seen increasingly as a successful therapy when conventional medical treatment has failed. In this case, a young lady 2 weeks post-partum presented with acute coronary syndrome secondary to a SCAD. ECMO was used successfully as a bridge to myocardial recovery following coronary artery bypass grafts and cardiogenic shock. A case study underpinned by a review of existing literature relating to spontaneous coronary artery dissection and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. ECMO is still a relatively new and invasive technology but continues to improve survival rates in critically ill patients where conventional medical treatment has failed. This article highlights requirement for further research into several aspects of care for the adult ECMO patient. Questions to be answered raised in this case study include recommendations for the weaning of inotropes and vasoconstrictors, frequency of blood gas sampling and whether it remains essential to have two nurses caring for the ECMO patient. As medical treatment progresses, there is an increasing demand for therapies such as ECMO to become more readily available for the care of the critically ill adult patient. This article highlights challenges that may be faced and what changes could be made to further improve standards of care and survival rates for ECMO patients.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28948652": " Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving system used for critically ill patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs can change in patients undergoing ECMO, which can result in therapeutic failure or drug toxicity requiring further management of drug complications. In this review, we discussed changes in the PK of antibiotic, antiviral, antituberculosis and antifungal agents administered to adult patients on ECMO. These drugs are crucial for managing infections, which commonly occur during ECMO. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed and EMBASE databases with the following keywords: \"extracorporeal membrane oxygenation OR extracorporeal membrane oxygenations OR ECMO\" and \"PK OR pharmacokinetics OR pharmacokinetic*\" and \"anti infective* OR antibiotic* OR antiviral* OR antituberculosis OR antifungal*.\" Generally, the volume of distribution (Vd) increases and drug clearance (CL) and elimination decrease during ECMO. Highly significant changes in drug PK can occur by interactions with the ECMO device itself, drug characteristics, pathological changes and patient characteristics. This may affect the blood concentrations of drugs, which influence the success of therapy. The PK of vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, azithromycin, amikacin and caspofungin did not change significantly in adult patients receiving ECMO. However, there were significant changes in the PK of imipenem, oseltamivir, rifampicin and voriconazole. The trough concentrations of imipenem were highly variable; oseltamivir had a decreased CL and increased Vd, and rifampicin concentrations were below therapeutic levels, even when a higher-than-standard dose was used in patients treated with ECMO. Additionally, voriconazole exhibited high mean peak concentrations during ECMO. The impact of ECMO on PK varies among drugs in adult patients, and there is no consistent correlation between the effects observed in adult and infant studies. This review suggested that doses of imipenem, oseltamivir, rifampicin and voriconazole should be adjusted and therapeutic drug monitoring is needed when ECMO is used in adult patients. In the future, large PK trials in adults on ECMO are needed to provide optimal dosing guidelines. A PK/PD modelling approach will be useful for determining the precise impact of ECMO and other factors that contribute to PK changes for each drug. Finally, it is important to develop dosing guidelines based on PK/PD modelling studies that can be used in clinical practice.",

ECMO exists in 2 primary configurations: veno-venous ECMO, used in the setting of isolated respiratory failure, and veno-arterial ECMO, which can be used in respiratory failure but is mandatory in the setting of cardiac failure. Acute kidney injury occurs frequently in patients on ECMO, and renal replacement therapy is often required. Continuous forms of renal replacement therapy predominate, but there is a high degree of variation in clinical practice among ECMO centers internationally. No consensus exists regarding the optimal technique, but the use of continuous renal replacement machines has been shown to be safe and effective in patients on ECMO.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI. CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched. Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included. Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods. From 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO. Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days. ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used. ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days. Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I\u00b2 = 64%). ECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection. Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.",

We assessed the outcomes of trauma patients requiring ECMO support and compared the overall survival of all patients with trauma at facilities with and without ECMO capabilities. A retrospective review of the National Trauma Data Bank was performed to identify all trauma patients receiving care at ECMO and non-ECMO centers. Baseline patient characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) was used to compare survival at ECMO and non-ECMO facilities. Between 2007 and 2015, a total of 5 781 123 patients with trauma were identified with 1 983 986 (34%) admitted to an ECMO facility and 3 797 137 (66%) admitted to a non-ECMO facility. A total of 522 (0.03%) patients required ECMO. Both the number of patients with trauma requiring ECMO support and the number of trauma facilities utilizing ECMO increased over the 9-year-study period (4.9 to 13.8 patients per 100 000 admissions, and 18 to 77 centers, respectively). The mortality for ECMO patients was 40.5%. Patients with trauma admitted to ECMO facilities had more severe injuries (injury severity score: 9.0 vs 8.0; P &lt; .001). The overall mortality was 3.3%. The adjusted OR for mortality associated with admission to an ECMO facility vs a non-ECMO facility was 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.95-0.97; adjusted P &lt; .001). The use of ECMO for patients with trauma is expanding. Our study demonstrates a survival benefit associated with admission to a facility with ECMO capabilities.

The two forms of ECMO, veno-arterial (VA) and veno-venous (VV), are used to support cardiopulmonary and pulmonary dysfunction, respectively. Historically, ECMO was predominantly used in the neonatal and pediatric populations, as early adult studies failed to improve outcomes. ECMO has become far more common in the adult population because of positive results in published case series and clinical trials during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009 to 2010. Advances in technology that make the technique much easier to implement likely fueled the renewed interest. Although exact criteria for ECMO are not available, patients who are good candidates are generally considered to be relatively young and suffering from acute illness that is believed to be reversible or organ dysfunction that is otherwise treatable. With the increase in the use in the adult population, a number of different codes have been generated to better identify the method of support with distinctly different relative value units assigned to each code from a very simple prior coding scheme. To effectively be reimbursed for use of the technique, it is imperative that the clinician understands the new coding scheme and works with payers to determine what is incorporated into each specific code.",

Its use as a medical application has increased since its inception to treat multiple conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, and septic shock. While complications including neurological and renal injury occur in patients on ECMO, bleeding and coagulopathy are most common. ECMO is associated with an inflammatory response promoting a hypercoagulable state, requiring anticoagulation to avoid thromboembolism originating in the nonendothelial surfaced circuit. However, excessive anticoagulation may result in bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhage. Monitoring anticoagulation for ECMO has its origins in cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery; however, there is no ideal level of anticoagulation, no standardized method to monitor anticoagulation, nor are all centers standardized on what is used for anticoagulation. Multiple blood products are used in an effort to decrease bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation, often in the setting of recent surgery, and this leads to significant increases in cost for patients on ECMO and transfusion-related complications. In this review article, we discuss the evolution of the various modalities of ECMO, indications, contraindications, and complications. Furthermore, we review the different strategies for anticoagulation and treatment of coagulopathy while on ECMO. Finally, we discuss the cost of ECMO and associated blood product transfusion.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25608845": " Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of life support that targets the heart and lungs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure accesses and returns blood from the venous system and provides non-pulmonary gas exchange. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe cardiac failure or for refractory cardiac arrest (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR)) provides gas exchange and systemic circulation. The configuration of ECMO is variable, and several pump-driven and pump-free systems are in use. Use of ECMO is associated with several risks. Patient-related adverse events include haemorrhage or extremity ischaemia; circuit-related adverse effects may include pump failure, oxygenator failure and thrombus formation. Use of ECMO in newborns and infants is well established, yet its clinical effectiveness in adults remains uncertain. The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine whether use of veno-venous (VV) or venous-arterial (VA) ECMO in adults is more effective in improving survival compared with conventional respiratory and cardiac support. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 18 August 2014. We searched conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, reference lists of retrieved articles and databases of ongoing trials and contacted experts in the field. We imposed no restrictions on language or location of publications. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs that compared adult ECMO versus conventional support. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations against the inclusion criteria. We independently reviewed full-text copies of studies that met the inclusion criteria. We entered all data extracted from the included studies into Review Manager. Two review authors independently performed risk of bias assessment. All included studies were appraised with respect to random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. We included four RCTs that randomly assigned 389 participants with acute respiratory failure. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one RCT. We found no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality at six months (two RCTs) or before six months (during 30 days of randomization in one trial and during hospital stay in another RCT). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate, and further research is very likely to impact our confidence in the estimate of effects because significant changes have been noted in ECMO applications and treatment modalities over study periods to the present.Two RCTs supplied data on disability. In one RCT survival was low in both groups but none of the survivors had limitations in their daily activities six months after discharge. The other RCT reported improved survival without severe disability in the intervention group (transfer to an ECMO centre \u00b1 ECMO) six months after study randomization but no statistically significant differences in health-related quality of life.In three RCTs, participants in the ECMO group received greater numbers of blood transfusions. One RCT recorded significantly more non-brain haemorrhage in the ECMO group. Another RCT reported two serious adverse events in the ECMO group, and another reported three adverse events in the ECMO group.Clinical heterogeneity between studies prevented meta-analyses across outcomes. We found no completed RCT that had investigated ECMO in the context of cardiac failure or arrest. We found one ongoing RCT that examined patients with acute respiratory failure and two ongoing RCTs that included patients with acute cardiac failure (arrest). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains a rescue therapy. Since the year 2000, patient treatment and practice with ECMO have considerably changed as the result of research findings and technological advancements over time. Over the past four decades, only four RCTs have been published that compared the intervention versus conventional treatment at the time of the study. Clinical heterogeneity across these published studies prevented pooling of data for a meta-analysis.We recommend combining results of ongoing RCTs with results of trials conducted after the year 2000 if no significant shifts in technology or treatment occur. Until these new results become available, data on use of ECMO in patients with acute respiratory failure remain inconclusive. For patients with acute cardiac failure or arrest, outcomes of ongoing RCTs will assist clinicians in determining what role ECMO and ECPR can play in patient care.",

In 2012, The IRCCS PSD ECMO Programme was instituted with the specific aim of achieving better results than hitherto obtained. After only 1 year of activity, the results justified the programme, with a better survival rate for each group investigated, particularly in adults, but surprisingly in paediatrics too, where the results were better than what reported by ELSO.

These are all hallmarks of some autoimmune diseases. Yaa is a Y-chromosome-linked gene that accelerates autoimmune diseases in some autoimmune-prone strains of mice. To further elucidate a possible relationship with autoimmunity, the effect of the Yaa gene on MAIDS was investigated. Analysis of phenotypic and functional disease parameters revealed that Yaa does not accelerate MAIDS disease. This is probably due to the generalized activation of most or all lymphoid cells in MAIDS, which cannot be enhanced by the Yaa gene. This result is in accordance with the selective enhancing effect of the Yaa gene on the immune response against self and foreign antigens in a specific genetic background. It suggests that the autoimmune response associated with MAIDS is a secondary phenomenon. Interestingly, even in wild-type C57BL/6 mice, autoantibody production may contribute overproportionally to the hypergammaglobulinemia associated with MAIDS.",

These three quantitative trait loci (QTL) on NZB chromosomes 1, 7, and 13 differentially regulated three different autoimmune traits: anti-nuclear autoantibody production, gp70-anti-gp70 immune complex (gp70 IC) formation, and glomerulonephritis. Contributions to the disease traits were further confirmed by generating and analyzing three different B6.Yaa congenic mice, each carrying one individual NZB QTL. The chromosome 1 locus that overlapped with the previously identified Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus regulated all three traits. A newly identified chromosome 7 locus, designated Nba5, selectively promoted anti-gp70 autoantibody production, hence the formation of gp70 IC and glomerulonephritis. B6.Yaa mice bearing the NZB chromosome 13 locus displayed increased serum gp70 production, but not gp70 IC formation and glomerulonephritis. This locus, called Sgp3 (serum gp70 production 3), selectively regulated the production of serum gp70, thereby contributing to the formation of nephritogenic gp70 IC and glomerulonephritis, in combination with Nba2 and Nba5 in NZB mice. Among these three loci, a major role of Nba2 was demonstrated, because B6.Yaa Nba2 congenic male mice developed the most severe disease. Finally, our analysis revealed the presence in B6 mice of an H2-linked QTL, which regulated autoantibody production. This locus had no apparent individual effect, but most likely modulated disease severity through interaction with NZB-derived susceptibility loci.",

Male (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice, carrying the BXSB Yaa gene, serve as a model for SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome. Using microsatellite markers in the NZW x (NZW x BXSB)F1 backcross male progeny, we mapped BXSB alleles contributing to the generation of anti-CL antibodies, platelet-binding antibodies, thrombocytopenia and myocardial infarction. Generation of each disease character was controlled by two major independently segregating dominant alleles, i.e. those on chromosomes (Chr.) 4 and 17 for anti-CL antibodies, Chr. 8 and 17 for both anti-platelet antibodies and thrombocytopenia and, to our surprise, Chr. 7 and 14 for myocardial infarction, and that a combination of the two alleles appeared to produce full expression of each character, as a complementary gene action. The alleles on Chr. 17 linked to the above three characters were all mapped in close proximity to the H-2 complex. Therefore, no single factor such as anti-CL antibodies can explain the pathogenesis of SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome. Rather, a combination of susceptibility alleles such as described here, along with additional modifying loci, i.e. BXSB Yaa and some from NZW, characterizes unique SLE features in male (NZW x BXSB) F1 mice.

A mutant gene located on the BXSB Y chromosome, designated Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), is responsible for the acceleration of the disease observed in male BXSB mice. Studies on H-2 congenic and I-E transgenic mice have clearly demonstrated that the MHC class II genes play a crucial role in the development or protection of SLE. However, the MHC effect can be completely masked by the presence of the Yaa gene in mice with certain genetic backgrounds. It is intriguing that the Yaa gene effect is selective on autoimmune responses, varying in different lupus-prone mice. Studies on immune responses against foreign antigens have shown that the Yaa gene potentiates immune responses only against antigens to which mice are genetically (H-2-linked) low-responding, but not high-responding. Thus, the selective immune enhancing activity of the Yaa gene may be related to differences in the capacity of T helper cells specific for given antigens. Moreover, studies on Yaa(+)-Yaa- bone marrow cell chimeric mice have suggested that a specific cognate interaction of T helper cells with Yaa+ B cells is responsible for a selective enhancing effect of immune responses to foreign antigens as well as autoantigens. It is significant that unlike the lpr mutation, whose abnormality is associated with the capacity of the Fas antigen to mediate apoptosis, the Yaa gene by itself is unable to induce significant autoimmune responses in mice without apparent SLE background. This suggests that the molecular defect of the Yaa gene is likely to differ from that of the lpr gene, and that the Yaa gene effect requires the abnormal autosomal genome present in lupus-prone mice. Based on these findings, a possible molecular nature of the Yaa gene abnormality will be discussed.",

We have investigated the role of the yaa gene in the development of the type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA), which is used as a model for rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast to the accelerating effects on development of lupus autoimmunity we can show that the presence of BXSB Y chromosome carrying the yaa gene block development of CIA in F1 crosses with three normally CIA-susceptible strains, DBA/1, C3H.Q and B10.Q. Backcross experiments showed an additional modulatory effect from other BXSB genes or possibly from DBA/1 X chromosome. To evaluate the effect mediated by the yaa gene alone, the BXSB Y chromosome was bred into the DBA/1 gene background. The DBA/1 congenic DBA/1.yaa male mice were less susceptible to arthritis development than their DBA/1 counterparts. (B10.QxDBA/1.yaa)F1 acquired resistance to arthritis development similar to that of DBA/1.yaa, indicating a role for the yaa gene alone. The serum levels of autoantibodies to CII were significantly suppressed in all strains carrying yaa. In DBA/1.yaa mice a reduced number of T cells were found to produce interferon-gamma after in vitro stimulation with CII. Thus, although autoreactive B cells are important in both diseases they play different roles in murine lupus and in CIA.",

Unlike the lpr gene, which causes the defects in the Fas antigen-mediating apoptosis, the autoimmune enhancing activity of the Yaa gene is selective, depending on autoantigens, and varies among lupus-prone mice. To obtain a better definition of the role of the Yaa gene in the acceleration of autoimmune disease, we have investigated immune responses to several foreign antigens to determine whether the Yaa gene is able to potentiate immune responses to foreign antigens in a selective manner. We report here that the Yaa gene potentiated immune responses against foreign antigens only in mice which are genetically (H-2-linked) low responding, but not high or non-responding. Moreover, studies on Yaa(+)-Yaa- double bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that B cells from Yaa+ mice were selectively stimulated to produce antibodies to low-responding antigen, human IgG, while both B cell populations similarly responded to high-responding antigen, ovalbumin. Our results suggest that first, the selective immune enhancing activity of the Yaa gene may be related to differences in the capacity of T helper cells specific for given self or foreign antigens; and second, a specific cognate interaction of T helper cells with Yaa+ B cells is apparently responsible for the selective enhancement of immune responses to antigens, to which mice are genetically low responding.",

In view of a possible role of marginal zone (MZ) B cells in murine SLE, we have explored whether the expression of the Yaa mutation affects the differentiation of MZ and follicular B cells, thereby implicating the acceleration of the disease. In this study, we show that both BXSB and C57BL/6 Yaa mice, including two different substrains of BXSB Yaa males that are protected from SLE, displayed an impaired development of MZ B cells early in life. Studies in bone marrow chimeras revealed that the loss of MZ B cells resulted from a defect intrinsic to B cells expressing the Yaa mutation. The lack of selective expansion of MZ B cells in diseased BXSB Yaa males strongly argues against a major role of MZ B cells in the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies in the BXSB model of SLE. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with mice deficient in CD22 or expressing an IgM anti-trinitrophenyl/DNA transgene suggests that the hyperreactive phenotype of Yaa B cells, as judged by a markedly increased spontaneous IgM secretion, is likely to contribute to the enhanced maturation toward follicular B cells and the block in the MZ B cell generation.",

We compared the clinical development (autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in these three F1 hybrids in the presence or absence of the mutant gene, Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), which normally accelerates the progression of murine SLE. (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid female mice bearing either the H-2b/b or H-2d/b haplotype developed a rapid course of severe SLE, while the appearance of disease was markedly delayed in H-2d/d hybrid females. However, in the presence of the Yaa gene, H-2d/d F1 males developed SLE as severe as H-2b/b and H-2d/b F1 males. These data indicate that (a) the conventional H-2b is a haplotype leading to susceptibility for murine SLE, while H-2d is a relatively resistant haplotype; (b) the H-2b haplotype exhibits a dominant effect on autoimmune responses, similar to the classical MHC-linked Ir gene effect; and (c) most strikingly, the Yaa gene totally abrogates the MHC effect on murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice.",

We and others recently demonstrated that the translocation of a cluster of X-linked genes onto the Y chromosome is the genetic lesion underlying Yaa (Subramanian, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2006. 103: 9970-9975; Pisitkun, P. et al., Science 2006. 312: 1669-1672). In male mice carrying Yaa, the transcription of several genes within the translocated segment is increased roughly twofold. Although the translocated X chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. To confirm the role of TLR7 in Yaa-mediated autoimmune phenotypes, we introgressed a targeted disruption of TLR7 (TLR7(-)) onto B6.Sle1Yaa to produce B6.Sle1YaaTLR7(-) and examined evidence of disease at 6 and 9 months of age. Our results demonstrate that the up-regulation of TLR7 in the B6.Sle1Yaa strain is responsible for splenomegaly, glomerular nephritis and the majority of the cellular abnormalities of B, T and myeloid cells. The up-regulation of TLR7 was also responsible for driving the infiltration and activation of leukocytes in the kidney, in which activated T cells were a primary component. However, the resolution of TLR7 up-regulation did not eliminate the enhanced humoral autoimmunity observed in B6.SleYaa, suggesting that additional elements in the translocation may contribute to the disease phenotype.",

Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa CD4 T cells develop the molecular signature for T(FH) cells and also show expression changes in numerous cytokines and chemokines. Disease development and all component autoimmune phenotypes were inhibited by Sles1, a potent suppressor locus. Sles1 had no effect on yaa-enhanced TLR7 signaling in vitro, and these data place Sles1 downstream from the lesion in innate immune responses mediated by TLR7, suggesting that Sles1 modulates the activation of adaptive immunity in response to innate immune signaling.",

To compare more directly the role of the Yaa and lpr genes in the development of the autoimmune syndrome, the Y chromosome of BXSB mice was transferred to MRL mice by backcross procedures, and the effect of the Yaa gene on the autoantibody formation and the development of lupus-like nephritis in MRL mice was investigated in comparison with those bearing the lpr mutation. The Yaa gene as well as the lpr gene were able to shorten the life span of MRL mice as a result of the accelerated development of lethal lupus-like nephritis. However, the acceleration promoted by the Yaa gene (50% mortality rate: 12 months) was less severe than that induced by the lpr gene (50% mortality rate: 7 months). This may be related to the finding that the lpr gene enhanced the production of a large spectrum of autoantibodies, including anti-DNA, rheumatoid factors and anti-gp70, and of cryoglobulins, whereas only anti-gp70 production among the autoantibodies studies was markedly enhanced by the Yaa gene. The selective autoimmune accelerating effect of the Yaa gene was similarly observed in (NZW X MRL)F1 hybrid mice. Our results suggest that the Yaa gene, unlike the lpr gene, exhibits selective autoimmune accelerating activity, but as a result of increased formation of certain nephritogenic autoantibodies such as anti-gp70 antibodies, the Yaa gene is able to accelerate the progression of lupus-like nephritis in lupus-prone mice.",

To investigate whether the H-2b haplotype and/or the lack of expression of I-E molecules play any role in the Yaa-linked acceleration of autoimmune disease, an I-E+ BXSB.H-2d congenic strain was created by backcross procedures. We compared the development of autoimmune disease in the novel BXSB.H-2d (I-E+) strain to that of BXSB.H-2b (I-E-) and BXSB.H-2b/d (I-E+) heterozygous mice. Male BXSB.H-2d (I-E+) mice exhibited only a limited production of autoantibodies and a lower incidence of glomerulonephritis with a markedly prolonged survival rate, which were essentially identical to those of female BXSB mice of both-H-2b and H-2d haplotypes. However, BXSB.H-2b/d (I-E+) heterozygous males developed an accelerated disease comparable to that of conventional BXSB.H-2b (I-E-) male mice. These results indicate that the expression of I-E molecules and consequent clonal deletion or anergy of I-E reactive T cells does not appear to be responsible for the prevention of accelerated autoimmune disease in BXSB.H-2d (I-E+) male mice. The finding that the Yaa gene-induced acceleration of lupus-like autoimmune disease is modulated by gene(s) within or closely linked to the H-2 complex underlines the crucial role of the major histocompatibility complex and the polygenetic nature of autoimmune disease in BXSB mice.",

We performed genome-wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and segregation analysis for novel disease-causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient-derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification. We identified biallelic mutations in PDXK in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair-bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP-binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization. We show that mutations in PDXK cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29103968": " Avelumab has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the therapy of Merkel cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma. M7824 is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein comprising a monoclonal antibody against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, avelumab), fused to the extracellular domain of human transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) receptor 2, which functions as a TGF\u03b2 \"trap.\" Advanced urothelial tumors have been shown to express TGF\u03b2, which possesses immunosuppressive properties that promote cancer progression and metastasis. The rationale for a combined molecule is to block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between tumor cells and immune cell infiltrate and simultaneously reduce or eliminate TGF\u03b2 from the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explored the effect of M7824 on invasive urothelial carcinoma cell lines. Human urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma cell lines HTB-4, HTB-1, and HTB-5 were treated with M7824, M7824mut (M7824 that is mutated in the anti-PD-L1 portion of the molecule and thus does not bind PD-L1), anti-PD-L1 (avelumab), or IgG1 isotype control monoclonal antibody, and were assessed for gene expression, cell-surface phenotype, and sensitivity to lysis by TRAIL, antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. M7824 retains the ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells, although in some cases to a lesser extent than anti-PD-L1. However, compared to anti-PD-L1, M7824 increases (A) gene expression of molecules involved in T-cell trafficking in the tumor (e.g., CXCL11), (B) TRAIL-mediated tumor cell lysis, and (C) antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated lysis of tumor cells. These studies demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of M7824 on both tumor cell phenotype and immune-mediated lysis. Compared to anti-PD-L1 or M7824mut, M7824 induces immunogenic modulation of urothelial carcinoma cell lines, rendering them more susceptible to immune-mediated recognition and lysis. These findings show the relevance of the dual blockade of PD-L1 and TGF\u03b2 in urothelial carcinoma cell lines and thus support the rationale for future clinical studies of M7824 in patients with urothelial cancer.",

The primary end point was overall survival, assessed among all patients who underwent randomization (overall population) and among those with tumors positive for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Secondary end points included progression-free survival and safety. Among all 700 patients who underwent randomization, the addition of maintenance avelumab to best supportive care significantly prolonged overall survival as compared with best supportive care alone (control).

According to the recent publications, they have been effective in case of progression after platinum therapy, in or after second-line and in firstline therapies for cisplatin ineligible patients, respectively. Patient survival and tumor response data are very promising; in particular stages, they seem to be more effective than the previously administered chemotherapies. Their toxicity profiles also appear to be more favorable. Immunological side effects are rare; their identification and management require preparedness and multidisciplinary thinking. Current and ongoing trials are investigating the combinations of new remedies with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab, tremelimumab) or chemotherapies as well as trying to identify biomarkers in order to further increase effectiveness.

During the last 3 decades treatment options were limited to chemotherapy, making further treatment of patients whose disease progressed under ongoing therapy or who were ineligible to receive cytotoxic therapy in the first place, nearly impossible. Five antibodies including pembrolizumab (PD-L1 antibody), atezolizumab (PD-1 antibody), nivolumab (PD-1 antibody), avelumab and durvalumab (PD-L1 antibodies) have been approved in the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma in first- and second-line treatment setting. The objective of this review was to examine and compare the different cohorts and to discuss the quality of the respective studies in order to set up selection criteria for clinical decision making. So far pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit in phase II studies and have shown superiority over standard chemotherapy in phase III studies which has granted them approval in first and second-line treatment setting. Improved OS and durable responses were also seen in phase Ib/II non-randomized, single-arm trials conducted with nivolumab, avelumab and durvalumab and granting accelerated approval for second-line treatment. The huge advantage of immunotherapy and one of the reasons for its overall recognition is its good tolerability profile especially in comparison to chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab has to be recommended in second-line therapy due to reporting in a phase III trial and OS survival benefit compared to chemotherapy control group. In cisplatin-eligible and treatment-na\u00efve patients with visceral or liver metastases data also slightly favors pembrolizumab rather than atezolizumab.",

Methods In this phase Ib, multicenter, expansion cohort, patients with urothelial carcinoma progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy and unselected for PD-L1 expression received avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives included confirmed objective response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1), progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), and PD-L1-associated clinical activity. PD-L1 positivity was defined as expression by immunohistochemistry on \u2265 5% of tumor cells. Results Forty-four patients were treated with avelumab and followed for a median of 16.5 months (interquartile range, 15.8 to 16.7 months). The data cutoff was March 19, 2016. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events of any grade were fatigue/asthenia (31.8%), infusion-related reaction (20.5%), and nausea (11.4%). Grades 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in three patients (6.8%) and included asthenia, AST elevation, creatine phosphokinase elevation, and decreased appetite. The confirmed objective response rate by independent central review was 18.2% (95% CI, 8.2% to 32.7%; five complete responses and three partial responses). The median duration of response was not reached (95% CI, 12.1 weeks to not estimable), and responses were ongoing in six patients (75.0%), including four of five complete responses. Seven of eight responding patients had PD-L1-positive tumors. The median progression-free survival was 11.6 weeks (95% CI, 6.1 to 17.4 weeks); the median OS was 13.7 months (95% CI, 8.5 months to not estimable), with a 12-month OS rate of 54.3% (95% CI, 37.9% to 68.1%).

The use of immunotherapeutic agents such as monoclonal antibodies has been considered a promising alternative for cancers that progress despite treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, and/or chemotherapeutic agents. Cancer cells escape immune surveillance by interrupting immune checkpoint pathways, resulting in dysregulation of T-cell function and so preventing its antitumor effects. In early 2017, avelumab (BAVENCIO\u00ae), a PD-L1-blocking monoclonal antibody agent, was approved for the treatment of metastatic MCC and UC. Trials that evaluated avelumab for the treatment of metastatic MCC and UC were the JAVELIN Merkel 200 Trial and the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, respectively. Efficacy results for both trials showed positive overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival rate (PFS). A strong safety profile was also established for avelumab.

Until 2018, there was no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for second-line setting, and only vinflunine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in Europe. However, targeting the programmed cell-death 1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) agents has shown encouraging results. Avelumab is a human anti-PD-L1 antibody that is currently being investigated in several trials. <b>Areas covered</b>: In this review article, we summarise preclinical, clinical, and safety data on avelumab for UC, and describeongoing trials that are evaluating avelumab for local or advanced diseases. We also compare its place in the management of UC. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Avelumab has shown clinical efficacy for metastatic and advanced UC in phase I studies after the failure of platinum-based therapy with a well-tolerated safety profile. This anti-PD-L1 targeting agent has the capacity to induce antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediated tumor cell lysis compared to other ICI. These results led to FDA approval of avelumab as a second-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic UC. Avelumab is also investigated in phase II and in a randomized phase III trial as a maintenance therapy in UC as well for combination use with chemotherapy.",

Most early clinical trials of avelumab as monotherapy and in combination regimens were part of the international JAVELIN clinical trial program, which included more than 7000 patients in more than 30 trials with at least 15 tumor types. Avelumab has been approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has progressed during or following treatment with a platinum-based regimen. Its acceptable safety profile and ability to induce durable responses in otherwise deadly tumors provide the rationale for its use in other tumor types and in combination with other therapies.",

Organized hierarchically, the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, coordinates peripheral clocks, via direct, or indirect signals. In peripheral organs, such as the liver, the circadian clock coordinates gene expression, notably metabolic gene expression, from transcriptional to posttranslational level. The metabolism in return feeds back on the molecular circadian clock via posttranslational-based mechanisms. During the last two decades, circadian gene expression studies have mostly been relying primarily on genomics or transcriptomics approaches and transcriptome analyses of multiple organs/tissues have revealed that the majority of protein-coding genes display circadian rhythms in a tissue specific manner. More recently, new advances in mass spectrometry offered circadian proteomics new perspectives, that is, the possibilities of performing large scale proteomic studies at cellular and subcellular levels, but also at the posttranslational modification level. With important implications in metabolic health, cell signaling has been shown to be highly relevant to circadian rhythms. Moreover, comprehensive characterization studies of posttranslational modifications are emerging and as a result, cell signaling processes are expected to be more deeply characterized and understood in the coming years with the use of proteomics. This review summarizes the work studying diurnally rhythmic or circadian gene expression performed at the protein level.

Among 415 retinal protein spots, 11 protein spots showed circadian rhythmicity in their intensities. We performed MALDI-TOF MS and NanoLC-MS/MS analyses and identified proteins contained in the 11 spots. The proteins were related to vesicular transport, calcium-binding, protein degradation, metabolism, RNA-binding, and protein foldings, suggesting the clock-regulation of neurotransmitter release, transportation of the membrane proteins, calcium-binding capability, and so on.

These symptoms and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with both the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains variable domains' complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character.

The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.",

Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. The characterization of mucocutaneous features was verified by 2 board-certified pediatric dermatologists. Twenty-five children (11 girls [44%]; median age, 3 years [range, 0.7-17 years]) were identified who met definitional criteria for MIS-C; an additional 10 children (5 girls [50%]; median age, 1.7 years [range, 0.2-15 years]) were included as probable MIS-C cases (patients met all criteria with the exception of laboratory test evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection or known exposure). The results of polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for 10 patients (29%), and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G tests were positive for 19 patients (54%).

We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif, and in particular its PRRA insert, to inhibit infection by blocking the access of host cell proteases, TMPRSS2 or furin, to the cleavage site. The high affinity of 6D3 for the furin-cleavage site originates from a poly-acidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2, a feature shared with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8.

She had glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and no significant previous history of any disease. She presented with signs of acute illness: high-grade fever (39.6\u00b0C) for five days accompanied by sore throat, malaise, reduced oral intake, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash, bilateral non-suppurative conjunctivitis, and erythematous, cracked lips. Eventually, she died despite aggressive management based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Saudi Ministry of Health guidelines for COVID-19 management.

Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third senior radiologist. <b>RESULTS.</b> Sixteen patients (10 male and six female patients; age range, 20 months-20 years) were included in this study. All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included the following: vomiting (12/16, 75%), abdominal pain (11/16, 69%), rash (10/16, 63%), conjunctivitis (8/16, 50%), diarrhea (7/16, 44%), headache (6/16, 38%), and sore throat (5/16, 31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly (10/16, 63%), congestive heart failure or cardiogenic pulmonary edema (9/16, 56%), atelectasis (9/16, 56%), pleural effusions (7/16, 44%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (2/16, 13%), and pneumonia (1/16, 6%). Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for pulmonary embolism (PE) (six [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and two [25%] by ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy). In two of the eight patients (25%), CTA showed a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (ultrasound, CT, and radiography) included small-volume ascites (6/16, 38%), hepatomegaly (6/16, 38%), echogenic kidneys (5/16, 31%), bowel wall thickening (3/16, 19%), gallbladder wall thickening (3/16, 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2/16, 13%), splenomegaly (1/16, 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1/16, 6%). The frequencies of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were as follows: cardiomegaly (12/16, 75%), pleural effusion (10/16, 63%), and atelectasis (10/16, 63%). Absolute interobserver agreement was 0.69-1 for thoracic findings and 0.17-1 for abdominal findings. Fifteen patients (94%) were discharged from the hospital (length of hospital stay: range, 3-20 days), and one patient remained in the hospital at the end of the study period. There were no mortalities. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular abnormalities, although solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities as well as ascites are also seen, reflecting a multisystemic inflammatory process. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> The constellation of imaging findings in the setting of COVID-19 may alert radiologists to the diagnosis of MIS-C before rapid deterioration of patients.",

Negative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing associated with positive serology in most of the cases suggests a postinfectious syndrome. Because the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still poorly understood, extensive virological and immunological investigations are needed. We report a series of 4 pediatric patients admitted to Geneva University Hospitals with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting the published definition of MIS-C related to COVID-19, to whom an extensive virological and immunological workup was performed. RT-PCRs on multiple anatomical compartments were negative, whereas anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were strongly positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. Both pseudoneutralization and full virus neutralization assays showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all children, confirming a recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. The analyses of cytokine profiles revealed an elevation in all cytokines, as reported in adults with severe COVID-19. Although differing in clinical presentation, some features of MIS-C show phenotypic overlap with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In contrast to patients with primary HLH, our patients showed normal perforin expression and natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. The levels of soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2R) correlated with the severity of disease, reflecting recent T-cell activation. Our findings suggest that MIS-C related to COVID-19 is caused by a postinfectious inflammatory syndrome associated with an elevation in all cytokines, and markers of recent T-cell activation (sIL-2R) occurring despite a strong and specific humoral response to SARS-CoV-2.

She was later found to be COVID-19 IgG positive, suggesting past exposure. This case represents an early report of a KD-like illness in an adult with serologic evidence of a previous COVID-19 infection, similar to MIS-C. It suggests that the virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 appears to cause a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome similar to KD in adults, as well as children.

Importantly, depletion of TDG inhibits E2-mediated transcription of eRNAs and transcription of ER-target genes. Functionally, we find that TDG both sensitizes MCF7 cells to tamoxifen-mediated cytostasis and increases migration and invasion of MCF7 cells. Taken together we find that TDG plays a central role in mediating transcription at a subset of enhancers and governs how MCF7 cells respond to both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic compounds and may be an effective therapeutic target.",

We previously demonstrated that a head-to-head natural antisense transcript (NAT) of DHRS4, denoted DHRS4-AS1, regulates all three genes of the DHRS4 gene cluster. However, it is puzzling that DHRS4L2 and DHRS4L1 did not evolve their own specific NATs to regulate themselves, as it seems both have retained sequences highly homologous to DHRS4-AS1. In a search of the DHRS4-AS1 region for nearby enhancers, we identified an enhancer located 13.8 kb downstream of the DHRS4-AS1 transcriptional start site. We further showed, by using a chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay, that this enhancer is capable of physically interacting with the DHRS4-AS1 promoter through chromosomal looping. The enhancer produced an eRNA, termed AS1eRNA, that enhanced DHRS4-AS1 transcription by mediating the spatial interactions of the enhancer and DHRS4-AS1 promoter in cooperation with RNA polymerase II and p300/CBP. Moreover, the distributions of activating acetyl-H3 and H3K4me3 modifications were found to be greater at the DHRS4-AS1 promoter than at the homologous duplicated regions. We propose that AS1eRNA-driven DNA looping and activating histone modifications promote the expression of DHRS4-AS1 to economically control the DHRS4 gene cluster.",

However, the role of eRNAs in regulating trophoblast cells and unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (URPL) remains elusive. We profiled eRNAs in villi from URPL patients and matched controls by RNA-seq. Functions of URPL-related eRNAs were further investigated in vitro. We identified lnc-SLC4A1-1, which was transcribed from an active enhancer marked with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 and so-called eRNA, highly expressed in URPL patients. Gain-of-function experiments indicated that lnc-SLC4A1-1 facilitated trophoblast cell migration and apoptosis. Mechanistically, as an eRNA, lnc-SLC4A1-1 was retained in the nuclei and recruited transcription factor NF-\u03baB to bind to CXCL8, resulting in increased H3K27ac in the CXCL8 promoter and subsequent elevation of CXCL8 expression. Activation of CXCL8 exacerbated inflammatory reactions in trophoblast cells by inducing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which could be blocked by an antagonist of lnc-SLC4A1-1. These findings indicate that an eRNA, lnc-SLC4A1-1, alters trophoblast function via activation of immune responses and by regulating the NF-\u03baB/CXCL8 axis. Our study provides new insights in understanding lncRNA/eRNA function in pathological pregnancy, potentially informing on therapeutic strategies for URPL.

We provide a computational analysis on eRNAs using genome-wide data across 12 mouse tissues. The expression of genes targeted by transcribing enhancer is positively correlated with eRNA expression and significantly higher than expression of genes targeted by non-transcribing enhancers. This result implies eRNA transcription indicates a state of enhancer that further increases gene expression. This state of enhancer is tissue-specific, as the same enhancer differentially transcribes eRNAs across tissues. Therefore, the presence of eRNAs describes a tissue-specific state of enhancer that is generally associated with higher expressed target genes, surmising as to whether eRNAs have gene activation potential. We further found a large number of eRNAs contain regions in which sequences and secondary structures are similar to microRNAs. Interestingly, an increasing number of recent studies hypothesize that microRNAs may switch from their general repressive role to an activating role when targeting promoter sequences. Collectively, our results provide speculation that eRNAs may be associated with the selective activation of enhancer target genes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3299107": "U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217, including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, suggesting the presence of a distant control element. DNase I footprinting of the 5' flanking region of the U6 gene shows protection of the octanucleotide sequence. Moreover, the 5' flanking sequence from -217 to -315 can replace the enhancer of a human U2 RNA gene. We therefore conclude that although U6 RNA genes appear to be transcribed by pol III, they are preceeded by an enhancer-like element which can functionally substitute for the enhancer of a pol II-transcribed U RNA gene.",

A number of other constructs, including plasmids also containing a murine sarcoma virus enhancer or lacking any natural eukaryotic promoter sequences, were also prepared. In apparent agreement with earlier conclusions that an RNA polymerase I transcript can act as a messenger RNA, transient transfection of mouse L cells with pPolI-CAT yielded both high levels of transcription from the RNA polymerase I promoter and enzymatically active CAT protein. However, further examination revealed that CAT protein is not translated from RNA that begins at the normal rRNA transcription initiation site. Polysomal RNA is devoid of such RNA and instead consists of CAT-encoding transcripts that begin elsewhere in the mouse ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region. Since transcription of these aberrant RNAs is stimulated by the addition of a murine sarcoma virus enhancer segment, they are probably transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Transcripts that map to the authentic rRNA start site are not similarly enhanced. Moreover, unlike the RNAs deriving from the rRNA initiation site, these aberrant RNAs are more stable and the level of translatable CAT transcripts is suppressed by inclusion of larger segments of the rDNA promoter regions. Fortuitously initiated mRNAs are also formed in the absence of any natural eukaryotic promoter sequence. From these data we conclude that there is no evidence that normal RNA polymerase I transcription yields functional mRNA and that transcriptional enhancement appears to be RNA polymerase specific.",

GRO-seq, a method for identifying the location and orientation of all actively transcribing RNA polymerases across the genome, is a powerful approach for monitoring nascent enhancer transcription. Furthermore, the unique pattern of enhancer transcription can be used to identify enhancers in the absence of any information about the underlying transcription factors. Here, we describe the computational approaches required to identify and analyze active enhancers using GRO-seq data, including data pre-processing, alignment, and transcript calling. In addition, we describe protocols and computational pipelines for mining GRO-seq data to identify active enhancers, as well as known transcription factor binding sites that are transcribed. Furthermore, we discuss approaches for integrating GRO-seq-based enhancer data with other genomic data, including target gene expression and function. Finally, we describe molecular biology assays that can be used to confirm and explore further the function of enhancers that have been identified using genomic assays.

This basic repeating unit is reiterated ca.500-fold per haploid genome. Oocyte injections of pXTU6-2 led to the transcription of a mature-sized U6 RNA that, however, lacked internal 2'-O-methylations. These posttranscriptional modifications of U6 RNA might be cytoplasmic and could require its association with U4 RNA to be accomplished. The low alpha- amanitin sensitivity of U6 RNA synthesis in oocytes suggested that U6 RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, consistent with features of the U6 RNA molecule which also contains a Box A- like intragenic control region. Inspection of X. tropicalis, mouse and human U6 DNA upstream sequences revealed the presence of a TATA box as well as of the proximal and enhancer (octamer motif) elements contained in snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. We propose that U6 RNAs are synthesized by a specialized transcription complex consisting of RNA polymerase III and transcription factors, some of which are very likely shared with RNA polymerase II promoters.",

Understanding how super-enhancer RNAs (seRNAs) contribute to specific gene regulation has thus become an area of active interest. Immune checkpoint deregulation is one of the key characteristics of tumors and autoimmune diseases, and is also closely related to cell identity. Recent studies revealed a potential pathway for seRNA's involvement in regulating the expression of immune checkpoints. The present study reviews the current knowledge of eRNA function, immune checkpoint blockage mechanism, and its effect.

Such regulatory elements often bypass intervening genes and typically comprise binding sites for multiple transcription factors that can also be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to produce noncoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Genome-wide analyses have revealed chromatin signatures of enhancers, such as the enrichment for monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and the acetylation or methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). Enhancer signatures have been used to describe the transitions of these regulatory elements from inactive to primed and from activated to decommissioned states during development.

We identified approximately 12,000 neuronal activity-regulated enhancers that are bound by the general transcriptional co-activator CBP in an activity-dependent manner. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis.

RBM7 associates broadly with RNA polymerase II-derived RNA, including pre-mRNA and short-lived exosome substrates such as promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), and 3'-extended products from snRNA and replication-dependent histone genes. Within pre-mRNA, RBM7 accumulates at the 3' ends of introns, and pulse-labeling experiments demonstrate that RBM7/NEXT defines an early exosome-targeting pathway for 3'-extended snoRNAs derived from such introns.

The histone variant H2A.Z has been shown to play important roles in transcription mainly by controlling proximal promoters, but its effect on enhancer functions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate by genome-wide approaches that H2A.Z is present at a subset of active enhancers bound by the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1). We also determine that H2A.Z does not influence the local nucleosome positioning around ER\u03b1 enhancers using ChIP sequencing at nucleosomal resolution and unsupervised pattern discovery. We further highlight that H2A.Z-enriched enhancers are associated with chromatin accessibility, H3K122ac enrichment and hypomethylated DNA. Moreover, upon estrogen stimulation, the enhancers occupied by H2A.Z produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), and recruit RNA polymerase II as well as RAD21, a member of the cohesin complex involved in chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Importantly, their recruitment and eRNAs production are abolished by H2A.Z depletion, thereby revealing a novel functional link between H2A.Z occupancy and enhancer activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that H2A.Z acts as an important player for enhancer functions by establishing and maintaining a chromatin environment required for RNA polymerase II recruitment, eRNAs transcription and enhancer-promoters interactions, all essential attributes of enhancer activity.",

This stimulation is known to be associated with an increased polymerase density over the linked gene. However, many aspects of the exact mechanism of remote gene control remain to be elucidated. Based on some reports on RNA polymerase I transcription, we wanted to test whether RNA polymerase II enters at the enhancer and from there proceeds towards the promoter while synthesizing unstable transcripts (\"scanning/readthrough transcription\" model). For this, we have inserted a complete terminator region from the mouse beta-globinmaj gene between the SV40 enhancer and the rabbit beta-globin promoter. In contrast to what the model predicts, insertion of the terminator had no affect on remote enhancer action. Furthermore, we have determined the RNA polymerase density over the spacer DNA between enhancer and promoter, and over the reporter gene, by means of the so-called run-on transcription assay. We find very low transcription of the spacer, but high transcription of the globin reporter gene. Thus, our data are not consistent with a scanning/readthrough transcription mechanism where RNA polymerase II would move from the enhancer to the promoter while transcribing the intervening spacer DNA. These and other findings are compatible with a model where enhancer and promoter are brought into close proximity, perhaps with concomitant looping out of the intervening DNA.",

To address this question, we have used an in vitro nuclear transcription assay to examine the effect of the SV40 enhancer on transcription of cloned human beta-globin genes transiently introduced into HeLa cells.

Thus, there is still a substantial unmet need for preventive migraine treatment. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has a demonstrated role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Galcanezumab-gnlm (galcanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the CGRP ligand and prevents binding to its receptor. It is administered as a once-monthly subcutaneous injection. The aim of this review is to present a comprehensive overview of the existing short- and long-term efficacy and safety data for galcanezumab in patients with migraine. Data from the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled EVOLVE-1, EVOLVE-2 and REGAIN studies show that galcanezumab treatment for 3 or 6 months results in overall reduction in mean monthly migraine headache days in patients with episodic (EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2) and chronic (REGAIN) migraine. Greater proportions of patients with episodic migraine receiving galcanezumab versus placebo demonstrated a \u2265 50%, \u2265 75% and 100% response to therapy and reported a lower level of disability and an improvement in functioning and QoL. Similarly, when compared with placebo, greater proportions of patients with chronic migraine treated with galcanezumab demonstrated a \u2265 50% and \u2265 75% response and reported improved functioning. A 12-month open-label study demonstrated the continued efficacy of galcanezumab for up to 12 months. In all studies galcanezumab was well tolerated.

Here we show that patients with prostate cancer who have lost a copy of <i>BRCA2</i> frequently lose a copy of tumor suppressor gene <i>RB1</i>; importantly, for the first time, we demonstrate that co-loss of both genes in early prostate cancer is sufficient to induce a distinct biology that is likely associated with worse prognosis. We prospectively investigated underlying molecular mechanisms and genomic consequences of co-loss of <i>BRCA2</i> and <i>RB1</i> in prostate cancer. We used CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi-based methods to eliminate these two genes in prostate cancer cell lines and subjected them to <i>in vitro</i> studies and transcriptomic analyses. We developed a 3-color FISH assay to detect genomic deletions of <i>BRCA2</i> and <i>RB1</i> in prostate cancer cells and patient-derived mCRPC organoids. In human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and LAPC4), loss of <i>BRCA2</i> leads to the castration-resistant phenotype. Co-loss of <i>BRCA2</i>-<i>RB1</i> in human prostate cancer cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is associated with invasiveness and a more aggressive disease phenotype. Importantly, PARP inhibitors attenuate cell growth in human mCRPC-derived organoids and human CRPC cells harboring single-copy loss of both genes.

The high CD154-positive MC (\u22658.6/HPF) group showed a lower overall five-year survival rate than the low CD154-positive MC (&lt;8.6/HPF) group (71.9% vs. 100.0%; <i>P</i>=0.012). Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of BM aspirates showed increased B lymphocytes and plasma cells with a normal phenotype (CD138\u207a/CD38\u207a/CD19\u207a/CD45\u207a/CD56\u207b). Approximately one third of WM patients showed other malignancies and all patients had increased MC. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric immunophenotyping are useful for diagnosing WM, and increased CD154-positive MC can indicate poor prognosis.",

Today, BCG immunotherapy is the choice of care for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) after transurethral resection. This article presents indications and procedure of BCG instillations, and outlines the effects on recurrence and progression of NMIBC. The BCG-induced immunity in NMIBC is not yet fully understood. Animal studies point towards BCG inducing specific tumour immunity. We describe the current knowledge of how this immunity is induced, from internalization of BCG bacilli in urothelial cells, to cytokine- and chemokine-mediated recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells. In addition, we describe the process of trained immunity, the non-specific protective effects of BCG. Recent studies also indicate that dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome may cause lower urinary tract dysfunction. Side effects of BCG bladder instillations range from common, mild and transient symptoms, such as dysuria and flu-like symptoms, to more severe and rarely occurring life-threatening complications. We review the literature and give an overview of reported incidences and management of BCG infections after intravesical instillation.",

Although the precise mechanism of BCG immunotherapy is still unclear, a local immune response is presumed. However, a number of severe side effects and complications are related to intravesical immunotherapy. Aim of this report is to present rare case of the renal granulomatous disease in a patient previously treated with intravesical instillation of BCG immunotherapy, following TURBT. In addition, we performed review of previously reported cases of renal granulomas following intravesical BCG immunotherapy. A 79-year-old man was presented to Urology Clinic due to clinically verified tumor of the urinary bladder. After transurethral resection of bladder tumor, histopathological analysis revealed the diagnosis of papillary urothelial high-grade pT1 carcinoma. Intravesical BCG immunotherapy was initiated, according to protocol currently used in our institution. Upon completion of therapy with BCG, we re-examined the patient and, using ultrasound, found a change in the right kidney, resembling moth bites not seen on CT scan before TURBT. Additionally, CT-guided core-needle biopsy of the affected kidney was performed, and the specimen was sent for histopathological analysis, which revealed chronic necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Antituberculotic therapy was initiated for 6 months. Upon completion of antituberculotic therapy, control CT-scan was performed at follow-up, indicating regression of changes on the right kidney. This case report emphasizes the importance of consistent implementation of follow-up protocol and the identification of lesions during the asymptomatic period and enables the proper treatment of the disease. To reduce the incidence of adverse effects of BCG treatment for bladder tumors, an individualized approach is needed.",

In this study 149 patients at high risk of recurrence after surgical treatment of local or regional malignant melanoma were given BCG for 2 years and were followed up for a median of 28 months from the start of immunotherapy. The 36 patients in the comparison group had a higher rate of recurrence than the patients treated with BCG, and the rate in the treatment group was close to that reported from a similar study at the University of California at Los Angeles. The relatively long disease-free interval for the high-risk comparison patients in this study suggests that the control groups at other centres may have included patients with unrecognized additional risk. The rates of survival in the Canadian treatment group were also comparable to those reported by other centres. However, reports of a favourable BCG-mediated pattern of recurrence could not be confirmed. Therefore, the routine use of adjuvant BCG immunotherapy is not recommended.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26032289": "Bladder cancer is a common malignant disease, with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) representing the majority of tumors. This cancer subtype is typically treated by transurethral resection. In spite of treatment, up to 70% of patients show local recurrences. Intravesical BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) immunotherapy has been widely used to treat NMIBC, but it fails to suppress recurrence of bladder tumors in up to 40% of patients. Therefore, the development of prognostic markers is needed to predict the progression of bladder cancer and the efficacy of intravesical BCG treatment. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of an E2F4 signature for prognostic prediction of bladder cancer. E2F4 scores for each sample in a bladder cancer expression dataset were calculated by summarizing the relative expression levels of E2F4 target genes identified by ChIP-seq, and then the scores were used to stratify patients into good- and poor-outcome groups. The molecular signature was investigated in a single bladder cancer dataset and then its effectiveness was confirmed in two meta-bladder datasets consisting of specimens from multiple independent studies. These results were consistent in different datasets and demonstrate that the E2F4 score is predictive of clinical outcomes in bladder cancer, with patients whose tumors exhibit an E2F4 score &gt;0 having significantly shorter survival times than those with an E2F4 score &lt;0, in both non-muscle-invasive, and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Furthermore, although intravesical BCG immunotherapy can significantly improve the clinical outcome of NMIBC patients with positive E2F4 scores (E2F4&gt;0 group), it does not show significant treatment effect for those with negative scores (E2F4&lt;0 group). The E2F4 signature can be applied to predict the progression/recurrence and the responsiveness of patients to intravesical BCG immunotherapy in bladder cancer.",

The initial clinical stage and grade remain the main determinant factors in survival irrespective of the treatment. Presently, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy remains the most effective treatment and prophylaxis for TCC (Ta, Tl, CIS) and has positive outcomes on tumor recurrence rate, disease progression, and prolongation of survival. Prostatic urethral mucosal involvement with bladder cancer can be effectively treated with BCG intravesical immunotherapy-it has demonstrated a reduction in tumor recurrence rates, but has had no positive impact on disease progression or prolongation of survival. Interferons, keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH), bropirimine, and PHOTOFRIN-photodynamic therapy (PDT) are under investigation in the management of TCC and early results are encouraging.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24064971": " High risk of recurrence/progression bladder tumours is treated with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy after complete resection of the tumour. Approximately 75% of these tumours express the uncommon carbohydrate antigen sialyl-Tn (Tn), a surrogate biomarker of tumour aggressiveness. Such changes in the glycosylation of cell-surface proteins influence tumour microenvironment and immune responses that may modulate treatment outcome and the course of disease. The aim of this work is to determine the efficiency of BCG immunotherapy against tumours expressing sTn and sTn-related antigen sialyl-6-T (s6T). In a retrospective design, 94 tumours from patients treated with BCG were screened for sTn and s6T expression. In vitro studies were conducted to determine the interaction of BCG with high-grade bladder cancer cell line overexpressing sTn. From the 94 cases evaluated, 36 had recurrence after BCG treatment (38.3%). Treatment outcome was influenced by age over 65 years (HR=2.668; (1.344-5.254); P=0.005), maintenance schedule (HR=0.480; (0.246-0.936); P=0.031) and multifocality (HR=2.065; (1.033-4.126); P=0.040). sTn or s6T expression was associated with BCG response (P=0.024; P&lt;0.0001) and with increased recurrence-free survival (P=0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that sTn and/or s6T were independent predictive markers of recurrence after BCG immunotherapy (HR=0.296; (0.148-0.594); P=0.001). In vitro studies demonstrated higher adhesion and internalisation of the bacillus to cells expressing sTn, promoting cell death. s6T is described for the first time in bladder tumours. Our data strongly suggest that BCG immunotherapy is efficient against sTn- and s6T-positive tumours. Furthermore, sTn and s6T expression are independent predictive markers of BCG treatment response and may be useful in the identification of patients who could benefit more from this immunotherapy.",

Despite its limitations, to date it has not been surpassed by any other treatment. As a better understanding of its mechanism of action and the clinical response to it have evolved, some of the questions around optimal dosing and treatment protocols have been answered. However, its potential for toxicity and failure to produce the desired clinical effect in a significant cohort of patients presents an ongoing challenge to clinicians and researchers alike. This review summarizes the evidence behind the established mechanism of action of BCG in bladder cancer, highlighting the extensive array of immune molecules that have been implicated in its action. The clinical aspects of BCG are discussed, including its role in reducing recurrence and progression, the optimal treatment regime, toxicity and, in light of new evidence, whether or not there is a superior BCG strain. The problems of toxicity and non-responders to BCG have led to development of new techniques aimed at addressing these pitfalls. The progress made in the laboratory has led to the identification of novel targets for the development of new immunotherapies. This includes the potential augmentation of BCG with various immune factors through to techniques avoiding the use of BCG altogether; for example, using interferon-activated mononuclear cells, BCG cell wall, or BCG cell wall skeleton. The potential role of gene, virus, or photodynamic therapy as an alternative to BCG is also reviewed. Recent interest in the immune check point system has led to the development of monoclonal antibodies against proteins involved in this pathway. Early findings suggest benefit in metastatic disease, although the role in superficial bladder cancer remains unclear.",

Although BCG-based therapy is the most effective intravesical therapy for this kind of tumor and represents the only agent known to reduce progression into muscle invasive bladder cancer, BCG is ineffective in approximately 30-40 % of cases and disease recurs in up to 50 % of patients. Since that BCG is considered an effective vehicle for delivery of antigens due to its unique characteristics, the genetic manipulation of these mycobacteria has been appealing in the search for less toxic and more potent therapeutic agents for bladder cancer immunotherapy.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15281319": "The advantage of BCG immunotherapy over intravesical chemotherapy in superficial bladder cancer has been most apparent in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), where complete response is increased from 50% to more than 70% and the proportion of patients remaining disease free for 5 years is increased from 20% to 40%. Similar advantages have been reported using suboptimal BCG treatment schedules in patients with recurrent stage Ta, T1 tumours. BCG provides long term protection from tumour recurrence and, unlike chemotherapy, reduces tumour progression. The observed relative increased sensitivity of CIS to BCG and the occasional failure of BCG to demonstrate significant superiority over mitomycin C in the prevention of tumour appear to be related to the use of suboptimal BCG treatment schedules. With maintenance BCG using 3 weekly instillations at 6 month intervals, patients with papillary tumours fare even better than patients with CIS, and tumour progressio is even further reduceld. Chemotherapy is appropriate for patients who are at very low risk of tumour progression and those who fail to respond to BCG, but overall the results of BCG immunotherapy are superior for patients with either CIS or Ta, T1 transitional cell carcinoma.",

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The administration of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy has become the standard of care for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and carcinoma in-situ (CIS) in terms of prevention of recurrence and progression. While most agree on a 6 week induction cycle, various maintenance schedules (if any at all) have been implemented without a unifying consensus. This review assesses the historical emergence of BCG immunotherapy, beginning with its discovery as a vaccinatin for tuberculosis to its effect on the host immune system and potential therapeutic benefits for various oncologic conditions. The data establishing BCG immunotherapy as the standard of care for high-grade NMIBC and CIS over other bladder instillation modalities is presented in addition to the effect maintenance BCG therapy has on sustaining the immuno-protective effect. Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy is currently the most effective treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and one of the most successful applications of immunotherapy to the treatment of cancer. This review summarises the history and development of BCG as a modern cancer treatment, appraises current optimal application of BCG immunotherapy in bladder cancer, discusses promising new therapies closely related to BCG, and briefly explores the possibility that BCG or related treatments may have an application in other urological malignancies. BCG is a nonspecific stimulant to the reticuloendothelial system and induces a local inflammatory response with the infiltration of granulocytes followed by macrophages and lymphocytes, particularly helper T cells. The initial BCG controlled trial showed a statistically significant reduction in tumour recurrence and found the advantage increased with duration of follow-up. Similar results were reported in much higher risk patients in an independent concurrent study. Follow-up suggested that a single 6-week course of intravesical BCG provided long-term protection (up to 10 years) from tumour recurrence and even reduced disease progression. While induction BCG (six weekly instillations) reduced recurrence, progression and mortality at 10 years, this advantage was lost by 15 years, and patients remained at high risk for progression without the use of maintenance BCG. In a meta-analysis by the Cochrane group, induction BCG was found to be markedly superior to mitomycin C in high-risk patients but not in low-risk patients. Additionally, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines lists the use of intravesical BCG as preferred therapy, citing Category 1 data for high-grade Ta, all T1, and any Tis tumours. Maintenance BCG therapy may be the most important advance in BCG treatment of bladder cancer since the initial introduction. The risk of tumour recurrence and disease progression is life-long in most patients, but the immune stimulation induced by BCG wanes with time. Logarithmic dose reduction of BCG in patients with increasing side-effects will typically prevent escalation of toxicity. Simple dose reduction, appropriate antibiotics, and understanding treatment contraindications have greatly increased the safety of BCG. The 3-week maintenance schedule for 3 years has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials and appears to be the current optimal treatment. With the success achieved in bladder cancer and the relative safety and economy of BCG, consideration should be given to further research for its effectiveness in other genitourinary malignancies.",

Identification of molecular prognosticators that might be helpful in discriminating between responders and nonresponders to BCG treatment is therefore of major clinical importance; thus we focused on the cell-cycle related retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which had been already investigated in bladder cancer. The goal of our study was specifically to address whether its expression predicts the outcomes of BCG treatment for patients with T1G3 disease. To address this issue, paraffin-embedded specimens of 27 patients having undergone transurethral resection of T1G3 BC and intravesical instillations of BCG (induction + 1 year maintenance) were immunostained with pRB monoclonal antibody. Patients in whom the bladder muscle was not clearly visible, and healthy, as well as patients with TaG3 tumors or with concomitant carcinoma in situ were excluded. Mean follow-up was 60 months (range 15-135). Thirteen tumors showed normal (1% to 50% labeling index) while 14 showed altered pRB expression, consisting of no expression (0% labeling index) in six and overexpression (&gt;50% labeling index) in eight. Recurrence occurred in 10 (37%) patients and mean time to recurrence was 22.8 months (range 6-48). Recurrence rate was 57% in patients with altered and 15% in those with normal pRB expression, with a statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (P = 0.037). Progression occurred in five (18.5%) patients and mean time to progression was 24 months (range 6-48). Progression rate was 36% in patients with altered and 0% in patients with normal pRB expression, with a statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (P = 0.018). In this homogeneous population of T1G3 bladder tumors, altered pRB expression predicted recurrence and progression after BCG treatment. These findings outline the potential role of pRB immunostaining in predicting T1G3 BC response to BCG immunotherapy.",

However, these reports have not penetrated the community, and many patients do not receive appropriate therapy. Additionally, several immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for treatment of metastatic disease. The approval of immune checkpoint blockade for patients with platinum-resistant or -ineligible metastatic bladder cancer has led to considerations of expanded use for both advanced and, potentially, localized disease. To address these issues and others surrounding the appropriate use of immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a Task Force of experts, including physicians, patient advocates, and nurses, to address issues related to patient selection, toxicity management, clinical endpoints, as well as the combination and sequencing of therapies. Following the standard approach established by the Society for other cancers, a systematic literature review and analysis of data, combined with consensus voting was used to generate guidelines.

However, individual patient outcome is barely predictable because of the lack of serum markers. Consequently, progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer and critical delay of treatments (such as neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy and/or radical cystectomy) often occur. The objectives of this study were to identify a marker for measuring the BCG-induced immune response and to predict the outcomes and potential improvements of BCG immunotherapy. Because host immunoresponse mediates BCG activity, the authors screened a combinatorial random peptide library on the circulating pool of immunoglobulins (Igs) purified from an index patient after successful BCG immunotherapy to identify the corresponding target antigen(s). An immunogenic peptide motif was selected, isolated, and validated from M. bovis BCG heat-shock protein 65 (HSP-65) as a dominant epitope of the humoral response to treatment. Increasing IgA and IgG anti-HSP-65 titers specifically predicted a positive patient outcome in a cohort of patients with bladder cancer relative to several cohorts of control patients. The current results indicated that antibody production against M. bovis BCG HSP-65 can serve as a serologic marker for the predictive outcome of BCG immunotherapy. Subsequent studies will determine the value of this candidate marker to modify BCG-based treatment for individual patients with bladder cancer.",

This point-counterpoint review considers how to treat a healthy 60-yr-old patient with T1 high-grade NMIBC fitting the new definition of BCG-unresponsive disease, that is, persistent high-grade disease at 6-12mo, despite an adequate course of induction and maintenance with BCG. PATIENT SUMMARY: When T1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is persistent or recurs shortly after a full course of bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) plus maintenance, further BCG is not likely to work; this meets the new definition of a \"BCG unresponsive\" disease.

For lamina propria invasive tumors and carcinoma in situ, intravesical immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is often the first line of treatment to decrease tumor recurrence and to possibly decrease progression and improve survival. Intravesical chemotherapy and interferon are alternative therapies that can also decrease recurrence rates.

Based on currently available data on the clinical application of checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors, the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue seems to be a main target for anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.

Using this insight, these agents are now being investigated for use in NMIBC. Although BCG has been used to treat high-risk NMIBC for decades, new applications of immunotherapy include the use of exogenous cytokines to boost immune response, vaccines to activate the immune system against specific tumor-associated antigens, intravesical agents that cause generalized local inflammation, and targeted antibodies against proteins on the surface of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Drugs such as mitomycin C used after transurethral resection of bladder tumour to reduce recurrences, bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy to treat high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and urothelial CIS and platin-based systemic chemotherapy to improve postcystectomy disease-specific survival are examples of therapy-related atypia seen in the urinary tract. To complicate the pathologist's life, a number of systemic drugs in use to treat other diseases, such cyclophosphamide, used to treat some autoimmune disorders or certain haematological malignancies or, in the case of anaesthetics, ketamine, used increasingly as an illegal recreational drug, may produce similarly relevant atypical changes in the urothelium, and therefore need to be differentiated from intraepithelial neoplasia. Other less frequent procedures, such as photodynamic and laser therapy or the newer gene therapy to treat urothelial neoplasia, remain experimental. An immunohistochemical approach to reactive urothelium versus carcinoma in situ using p53, cytokeratin 20 and CD44 is also valid in the post-therapy setting.

TCC and endothelial cell lines were able to secrete IP-10 in response to BCG or IFN stimulation in vitro. Furthermore intravesicular BCG induces a cytokine-rich urinary microenvironment that is inhibitory to human endothelial cells and it is anti-angiogenetic by the induction of Th1 chemokines.

We aimed to investigate prognostic significance of pre- and post-treatment PD-L1 expression in patients treated with BCG for high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We reviewed a total of 141 high-grade NMIBC cases treated with transurethral resection + \u2265 6 BCG instillations between 2004 and 2017. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring was done on 0-3 scale, and cut-off for positive and high-level PD-L1 expression was set to \u2265 1% and \u2265 5% staining of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC), respectively. Clinicopathologic characteristics and oncologic outcomes [recurrence-free (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS)] were compared, stratified by PD-L1 positivity. The prognostic role of PD-L1 was assessed using Kaplan-Meier, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Pre-treatment, 46.2% and 6.8% of high-grade NMIBC demonstrated positive and high-level PD-L1 expression, respectively. Positive PD-L1 expression was associated with submucosal invasion and refractory-tumor recurrence. PD-L1 expression was not associated with RFS or PFS in regression analysis. Post-treatment, 55.1% and 11.6% of recurrent tumors demonstrated positive and high-level PD-L1 expression, respectively. Down-regulation of PD-L1 expression was noted in patients with refractory recurrence (p = 0.012). Pre-treatment PD-L1 expression was associated with unfavorable pathological features in primary high-grade NMIBC and its expression level after BCG immunotherapy was significantly decreased in patients with refractory recurrence. PD-L1 expression did not have prognostic value for PFS or RFS; therefore, further research is necessary to identify novel biomarkers for prediction of disease outcomes in high-grade NMIBC.",

To determine if postoperative adjuvant immunization with BCG was an effective systemic treatment in these patients with microscopic subclinical metastatic disease, the clinical course of 42 patients treated by operation alone was compared with that of 84 treated by operation and BCG. At two years, the incidence of metastasis in BCG-treated patients was half that of the control group. BCG was more effective in patients with a smaller tumor burden at the time of initial surgical treatment. In patients receiving BCG adjuvant therapy, 90 per cent with microscopic disease in one lymph node appeared free of disease as compared to 40 per cent with macroscopic disease in multiple nodes. In patients with recurrences, an immunotherapeutic effect was demonstrated by a delay of six months in the time to recurrence. Thus, BCG immunotherapy appears to have an inhibiting effect on the \"micrometastases\" of malignant melanoma.",

Intravesical chemotherapy completely eradicates the disease in 50% of patients, but fewer than 20% remain disease free after 5 years. Complete responses have been reported in 70% or more of BCG treated patients, nearly two-thirds of which are durable. Controversy over the optimal induction and maintenance regimens for BCG immunotherapy remain, but SWOG investigators have demonstrated that complete response rates can be increased from the expected 73% to 87% with just three additional BCG instillations given at 3 months. In complete responders, maintenance BCG using three weekly treatments at 6-month intervals improves long-term complete response rates from 65% to nearly 90%.

Following resection of existing tumors, patients were stratified according to tumor grade and number of previous recurrences and randomly assigned to control or BCG treatment groups. Immunotherapy consisted of six weekly administrations of Pasteur strain BCG using 120 mg intravesically and 5 mg percutaneously. Immunotherapy side effects were minimal and no patient required postponement of BCG treatments. Eleven control (46%) compared with five (22%) BCG-treated patients had tumor recurrence (P = 0.078, chi 2). Prolongation of the disease-free interval with BCG treatment was significantly at the P = 0.016 level by Wilcoxon analysis. Four control and two BCG-treated patients had multiple recurrences. Comparing total episodes of recurrence, nineteen of 79 (24%) control and eight of 85 (7%) BCG group cystoscopic examinations revealed tumor (P = 0.006, chi 2). Immunologic correlates of response to immunotherapy were not statistically significant since only five BCG-treated patients had tumor recurrence. However, four of these five patients evidenced impaired LIF response to PPD at the time of tumor recurrence, and impairment of skin test reactivity and BCG humoral antibody response were more commonly seen in this subgroup of patients.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/178234": "The results of various in vitro analyses indicate there is an active immune response against antigens associated with human malignancies. This immune response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease. Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease, but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease. However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden; consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be combined with a tumor-associated antigen. If these principles are true for man, it would seem that improvements for nonspecific immunotherapy in human neoplasms would be further augmented if a tumor-related antigen could be extracted from human tumours and combined with a nonspecific immunologic stimulant.",

Direct injection of metastatic melanoma lesions limited to skin resulted in 90% regression of injected lesions and 17% regression of uninjected lesions in immunocompetent patients. Approximately 25% of these patients remained free of disease for 1 to 6 years. Direct injections of BCG into nodules of patients with subcutaneous or visceral metastases resulted in a lower incidence of local control and no long term survivors. Attempts to improve the results of immunotherapy in these patients by palliative surgical resection of large metastatic lesions to lower tumor burden followed by BCG immunotherapy significantly improved the results although many patients still developed recurrent disease. Early results of a clinical trial combining BCG immunotherapy with regional lymphadenectomy in patients with melanoma metastatic to lymph nodes have been encouraging and promising. Further controlled clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the role of BCG in immunotherapy. However, since BCG is but one of a number of potential immunologic adjuvants, even more effective immunotherapy will be possible as further knowledge of the interactions of cellular and humoral immunity is acquired.",

Dynamic chromatin conformation and spatial organization of the genome constitute a major step in this regulation to modulate developmental outputs. Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) mediate stable or flexible gene repression in response to internal and environmental cues. In Arabidopsis thaliana, LHP1 co-localizes with H3K27me3 epigenetic marks throughout the genome and interacts with PRC1 and PRC2 members as well as with a long noncoding RNA. Here, we show that LHP1 is responsible for the spreading of H3K27me3 towards the 3' end of the gene body. We also identified a subset of LHP1-activated genes and demonstrated that LHP1 shapes local chromatin topology in order to control transcriptional co-regulation. Our work reveals a general role of LHP1 from local to higher conformation levels of chromatin configuration to determine its accessibility to define gene expression patterns.",

Mechanisms regulating INK4/ARF expression are not fully characterized. Here we show that in young proliferating embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member EZH2 together with PRC1 members BMI1 and M33 are strongly expressed and localized at the INK4/ARF regulatory domain (RD) identified as a DNA replication origin. When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This loss is accompanied with an increased expression of the histone demethylase Jmjd3 and with the recruitment of the MLL1 protein, and correlates with the expression of the Ink4a/Arf genes. Moreover, we show that the Polycomb protein BMI1 interacts with CDC6, an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Polycomb proteins and associated epigenetic marks are crucial for the control of the replication timing of the INK4a/ARF locus during senescence. We identified the replication licencing factor CDC6 as a new partner of the Polycomb group member BMI1. Our results suggest that in young cells Polycomb proteins are recruited to the INK4/ARF locus through CDC6 and the resulting silent locus is replicated during late S-phase. Upon senescence, Jmjd3 is overexpressed and the MLL1 protein is recruited to the locus provoking the dissociation of Polycomb from the INK4/ARF locus, its transcriptional activation and its replication during early S-phase. Together, these results provide a unified model that integrates replication, transcription and epigenetics at the INK4/ARF locus.",

They assemble into multi-protein complexes, e.g., Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1, PRC2), which are thought to act in a sequential manner to stably maintain gene repression. PRC2 induces histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is subsequently read by PRC1 that further catalyzes H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), creating a transcriptional silent chromatin conformation. PRC2 components are conserved in plants and have been extensively characterized in Arabidopsis. In contrast, PRC1 composition and function are more diverged between animals and plants. Only more recently, PRC1 existence in plants has been documented. Here we review the aspects of plant specific and conserved PRC1 and highlight critical roles of PRC1 components in seed embryonic trait determinacy, shoot stem cell fate determinacy, and flower development in Arabidopsis.",

However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is read to exert downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b in atzrf1a atzrf1b mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, abnormal meristem activity, abnormal flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis defects. Some of these defects overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-defective mutants atbmi1a atbmi1b and atring1a atring1b, but others are specific to atzrf1a atzrf1b In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in atzrf1a atzrf1b seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in atring1a atring1b and atbmi1a atbmi1b Finally, we show that in both atzrf1a atzrf1b and atbmi1a atbmi1b seedlings, the seed developmental genes ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3, CRUCIFERIN3, and CHOTTO1 are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3).

This study investigated the framework by which histone marks influence DNA methylation at a genome-wide level. Using RNAi in a pluripotent human embryonic carcinoma cell line we depleted essential components of the MLL/COMPASS, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and PRC1 histone modifying complexes that establish, respectively, the post-translational modifications H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub, and assayed the impact of the subsequent depletion of these marks on the DNA methylome. Absence of H2AK119ub resulted predominantly in hypomethylation across the genome. Depletion of H3K4me3 and, surprisingly, H3K27me3 caused CpG island hypermethylation at a subset of loci. Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks, becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Taken together, our results elucidate novel roles for polycomb and MLL/COMPASS in regulating DNA methylation and define targets of this regulation.",

The aim of this document by the European Headache Federation (EHF) is to provide an evidence-based and expert-based guideline on the use of the monoclonal antibodies acting on the calcitonin gene-related peptide for migraine prevention. The guideline was developed following the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The working group identified relevant questions, performed systematic review and analysis of the literature, assessed the quality of available evidence, and wrote recommendations. Where the GRADE approach was not applicable, expert opinion was provided. We found low to high quality of evidence to recommend eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab in patients with episodic migraine and medium to high quality of evidence to recommend erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab in patients with chronic migraine. For several clinical questions, there was not enough evidence to provide recommendations using the GRADE approach and recommendations relied on experts' opinion. Monoclonal antibodies acting on the calcitonin gene-related peptide are new drugs which can be recommended for migraine prevention.

Clinically, these deletions are considered to be part of a unique microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability and speech impairment, typical dysmorphic features, structural anomalies of the brain, microcephaly, and non-specific multiple organ anomalies. The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and hearing loss. Chromosome analysis by array-CGH revealed a small interstitial 6q deletion spanning approximately 1.1 Mb of DNA and containing only one coding gene, ARID1B.

The activity and quantity of neutrophil serine proteases, including neutrophil elastase, are increased in the sputum of patients with bronchiectasis at baseline and increase further during exacerbations. Brensocatib (INS1007) is an oral reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP-1), an enzyme responsible for the activation of neutrophil serine proteases. In a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients with bronchiectasis who had had at least two exacerbations in the previous year to receive placebo, 10 mg of brensocatib, or 25 mg of brensocatib once daily for 24 weeks. The time to the first exacerbation (primary end point), the rate of exacerbations (secondary end point), sputum neutrophil elastase activity, and safety were assessed. Of 256 patients, 87 were assigned to receive placebo, 82 to receive 10 mg of brensocatib, and 87 to receive 25 mg of brensocatib. The 25th percentile of the time to the first exacerbation was 67 days in the placebo group, 134 days in the 10-mg brensocatib group, and 96 days in the 25-mg brensocatib group. Brensocatib treatment prolonged the time to the first exacerbation as compared with placebo (P = 0.03 for 10-mg brensocatib vs. placebo; P = 0.04 for 25-mg brensocatib vs. placebo). The adjusted hazard ratio for exacerbation in the comparison of brensocatib with placebo was 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.95) in the 10-mg group (P = 0.03) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99) in the 25-mg group (P = 0.046).

We demonstrated that CUF1 was involved both in copper acquisition and in copper detoxification in response to copper variation. This was verified by direct measurement of the quantity of intracellular copper with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and molecular evidence. In copper-limited growth, the mutant cuf1\u0394 exhibited copper deficiency, growth defect on glycerol and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and methionine. A novel function of cryptococcal CUF1 is revealed in copper detoxification when copper is in excess. The mutant cuf1\u0394 showed severe hypersensitivity to exogenous copper, while a high level of copper was accumulated shown by FAAS, suggesting that CUF1 may be required in copper export events. On cloning of cDNA, it was found that Cuf1 distinguishably harbors functional elements that are found in Ace1 and Mac1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The regulation of copper homeostasis by Cuf1 is realized by its subcellular localization. Epifluorescence microscopy observed that, upon copper depletion, Cuf1 was localized exclusively to the nucleus as an activator for CTR4 transcription, while it was located to the cell periphery in the presence of exogenous copper.

The requirement for copper is absolute for their activity. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cao1(+) and cao2(+) genes are predicted to encode members of the CAO family. While both genes are expressed in wild-type cells, we determined that the expression of only cao1(+) but not cao2(+) results in the production of an active enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis identified three histidine residues within the C-terminal region of Cao1 that are necessary for amine oxidase activity. By use of a cao1(+)-GFP allele that retained wild-type function, Cao1-GFP was localized in the cytosol (GFP is green fluorescent protein). Under copper-limiting conditions, disruption of ctr4(+), ctr5(+), and cuf1(+) produced a defect in amine oxidase activity, indicating that a functionally active Cao1 requires Ctr4/5-mediated copper transport and the transcription factor Cuf1. Likewise, atx1 null cells exhibited substantially decreased levels of amine oxidase activity. In contrast, deletion of ccc2, cox17, and pccs had no significant effect on Cao1 activity. Residual amine oxidase activity in cells lacking atx1(+) can be restored to normal levels by returning an atx1(+) allele, underscoring the critical importance of the presence of Atx1 in cells. Using two-hybrid analysis, we demonstrated that Cao1 physically interacts with Atx1 and that this association is comparable to that of Atx1 with the N-terminal region of Ccc2. Collectively, these results describe the first example of the ability of Atx1 to act as a copper carrier for a molecule other than Ccc2 and its critical role in delivering copper to Cao1.",

A nuclear pool of Cuf1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated by expressing a functional cuf1(+)-GFP allele in the presence of a copper chelator. We then extinguished cuf1(+)-GFP expression and tracked the changes in the localization of the nuclear pool of Cuf1-GFP in the presence of low or high copper concentrations. Treating cells with copper as well as silver ions resulted in the nuclear export of Cuf1. We identified a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), (349)LAALNHISAL(358), within the C-terminal region of Cuf1. Mutations in this sequence abrogated Cuf1 export from the nucleus. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions that impair Cuf1 NES function resulted in increased target gene expression and a concomitant cellular hypersensitivity to copper. Export of the wild-type Cuf1 protein was inhibited by leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export protein Crm1. We further show that cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutation in crm1(+) exhibit increased nuclear accumulation of Cuf1 at the nonpermissive temperature. Although wild-type Cuf1 is localized in the nucleus in both conditions, we observed that the protein can still be inactivated by copper, resulting in the repression of ctr4(+) gene expression in the presence of exogenous copper. These results demonstrate that nuclear accumulation of Cuf1 per se is not sufficient to cause the unregulated expression of the copper transport genes like ctr4(+). In addition to nuclear localization, a functional Cys-rich domain or NES element in Cuf1 is required to appropriately regulate copper transport gene expression in response to changes in intracellular copper concentration.",

This involves transporters that mediate the passage of copper across biological membranes to reach essential intracellular copper-requiring enzymes. In this report, we identify a new copper transporter in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encoded by the ctr6(+) gene. The transcription of ctr6(+) is induced under copper-limiting conditions. This regulation is mediated by the cis-acting promoter element CuSE (copper-signaling element) through the copper-sensing transcription factor Cuf1. An S. pombe strain bearing a disrupted ctr6Delta allele displays a strong reduction of copper,zinc superoxide dismutase activity. When the ctr6+ gene is overexpressed from the thiamine-inducible nmt1(+) promoter, the cells are unable to grow on medium containing exogenous copper. Surprisingly, this copper-sensitive growth phenotype is not due to an increase of copper uptake at the cell surface. Instead, copper delivery across the plasma membrane is reduced. Consistently, this results in repressing ctr4(+) gene expression. By using a functional ctr6(+) epitope-tagged allele expressed under the control of its own promoter, we localize the Ctr6 protein on the membrane of vacuoles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ctr6 is an integral membrane protein that can trimerize. Moreover, we show that Ctr6 harbors a putative copper-binding Met-X-His-Cys-X-Met-X-Met motif in the amino terminus, which is essential for its function. Our findings suggest that under conditions in which copper is scarce, Ctr6 is required as a means to mobilize stored copper from the vacuole to the cytosol.",

We observed that ctr4(+), a previously identified copper transport protein from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, fails to complement bakers' yeast cells defective in high affinity copper transport and fails to be targeted to the plasma membrane. However, selection for S. pombe genes, which, when co-expressed with Ctr4, confer high affinity copper transport to S. cerevisiae cells resulted in the identification of ctr5(+). Both Ctr4 and Ctr5 are integral membrane proteins, are co-regulated by copper levels and the copper-sensing transcription factor Cuf1, physically associate in vivo, are interdependent for secretion to the plasma membrane, and are each essential for high affinity copper transport. These studies in S. pombe identify Ctr4 and Ctr5 as components of a novel eukaryotic heteromeric plasma membrane complex that is essential for high affinity copper transport.",

The route of virus replication and protein expression is determined by the viral genome type. Comparison of these routes led to the classification of viruses into seven \"Baltimore classes\" (BCs) that define the major features of virus reproduction. However, recent phylogenomic studies identified multiple evolutionary connections among viruses within each of the BCs as well as between different classes. Due to the modular organization of virus genomes, these relationships defy simple representation as lines of descent but rather form complex networks. Phylogenetic analyses of virus hallmark genes combined with analyses of gene-sharing networks show that replication modules of five BCs (three classes of RNA viruses and two classes of reverse-transcribing viruses) evolved from a common ancestor that encoded an RNA-directed RNA polymerase or a reverse transcriptase. Bona fide viruses evolved from this ancestor on multiple, independent occasions via the recruitment of distinct cellular proteins as capsid subunits and other structural components of virions. The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are a polyphyletic class, with different groups evolving by recombination between rolling-circle-replicating plasmids, which contributed the replication protein, and positive-sense RNA viruses, which contributed the capsid protein. The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses are distributed among several large monophyletic groups and arose via the combination of distinct structural modules with equally diverse replication modules. Phylogenomic analyses reveal the finer structure of evolutionary connections among RNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses, ssDNA viruses, and large subsets of dsDNA viruses. Taken together, these analyses allow us to outline the global organization of the virus world.

Since DKK1 itself is a target of TCF/\u03b2-catenin mediated transcription, these findings suggest that DKK1 is part of a negative feedback loop in MM and may act as a tumor suppressor. In line with this hypothesis, we show here that DKK1 expression is low or undetectable in a subset of patients with advanced MM as well as in MM cell lines. This absence of DKK1 is correlated with enhanced Wnt pathway activation, evidenced by nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, which in turn can be antagonized by restoring DKK1 expression. Analysis of the DKK1 promoter revealed CpG island methylation in several MM cell lines as well as in MM cells from patients with advanced MM. Moreover, demethylation of the DKK1 promoter restores DKK1 expression, which results in inhibition of \u03b2-catenin/TCF-mediated gene transcription in MM lines. Taken together, our data identify aberrant methylation of the DKK1 promoter as a cause of DKK1 silencing in advanced stage MM, which may play an important role in the progression of MM by unleashing Wnt signaling.",

The wnt signaling pathway plays multiple roles in cardiovascular development through a network of intracellular effectors. To monitor global changes in wnt signaling during ES cell differentiation, we generated independent ES cell lines carrying the luciferase gene under promoters that uniquely respond to specific wnt pathway branches. Our results show that successive, mutually exclusive waves of noncanonical and canonical wnt signaling precede mesoderm differentiation. Blocking the initial noncanonical JNK/AP-1 signaling with SP60125 aborts cardiovascular differentiation and promotes hematopoiesis, whereas interference with the subsequent peak of canonical wnt signaling using Dkk1 has the opposite effect. Dkk1 blockade triggers counter mechanisms that lead to delayed and extended activation of canonical wnt signaling and mesoderm differentiation that appear to favor the cardiomyocytic lineage at the expense of hematopoietic cells. The cardiomyocytic yield can be further enhanced by overexpression of Wnt11 leading to approximately 95-fold enrichment in contracting cells. Our results suggest that the initial noncanonical wnt signaling is necessary for subsequent activation of canonical signaling and that the latter operates under a regulatory loop which responds to suppression with hyperactivation of compensatory mechanisms. This model provides new insights on wnt signaling during ES cell differentiation and points to a method to induce cardiomyocytic differentiation without precise timing of wnt signaling manipulation. Taking into account the heterogeneity of pluripotent cells, these findings might present an advantage to enhance the cardiogenic potential of stem cells.",

The Hesx1-expression domain of the ANP is underlain by Dkk1-expressing tissues, initially proximal-most anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), and later anterior mesendoderm (AME). As Dkk1-null embryos fail to develop the Hesx1-expressing domain, it is likely that Wnt signal inhibition in the ANP is required for the Hesx1 activation. To investigate the regulation of the AFBP development, we took advantage of epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which develop into the ANP in the absence of activin signaling. Expression of Hesx1 and Six3, both involved in the AFBP development, was strongly activated 2 days after activin removal and concomitant addition of Wnt signal inhibitors, Dkk1 or XAV939. Furthermore, we showed that activation of the 720-bp Hesx1 5' enhancer is responsible for Hesx1 expression in the AFBP and depends on Wnt signal inhibition. In addition, we showed that Wnt inhibition during the first day has larger impact on the activation of Hesx1 and Six3 than the second day, suggesting that in embryos Wnt inhibition caused by the AVE-derived Dkk1, rather than the AME-derived Dkk1, contributes greatly in the establishment of the AFBP.",

DKK1 is also implicated in osteoporosis, arthritis, and cancer and represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases. DKK1 is a high affinity antagonistic ligand for LRP6, which is a Wnt coreceptor that acts together with the Frizzled serpentine receptor to initiate Wnt signal transduction. Two different models have been proposed to account for the mechanism by which DKK1 antagonizes LRP6 function. One model suggests that DKK1 binding to LRP6 disrupts Wnt-induced Frizzled-LRP6 complex formation, whereas the other model proposes that DKK1 interaction with LRP6 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation, thereby reducing the cell surface LRP6 level. To clarify the molecular basis of DKK1 action, we examined how DKK1 affects the endogenous LRP6 in several mammalian cell lines including mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Here we show that DKK1 inhibits Wnt signaling but induces neither LRP6 down-regulation from the cell surface nor reduction of total LRP6 protein level and that DKK1 has no effect on the rate of continuous internalization of LRP6 and the half-life (about 4.7 h) of LRP6. We conclude that DKK1 inhibition of LRP6 is independent of LRP6 internalization and degradation.",

The molecular mechanisms, which control both the initial development and subsequent maintenance of these critical microenvironments, are poorly defined. Wnt signaling has been shown to be important to the development of several epithelial tissues and organs. Regulation of Wnt signaling has also been shown to impact both early thymocyte and thymic epithelial development. However, early blocks in thymic organogenesis or death of the mice have prevented analysis of a role of canonical Wnt signaling in the maintenance of TECs in the postnatal thymus. Here we demonstrate that tetracycline-regulated expression of the canonical Wnt inhibitor DKK1 in TECs localized in both the cortex and medulla of adult mice, results in rapid thymic degeneration characterized by a loss of DeltaNP63(+) Foxn1(+) and Aire(+) TECs, loss of K5K8DP TECs thought to represent or contain an immature TEC progenitor, decreased TEC proliferation and the development of cystic structures, similar to an aged thymus. Removal of DKK1 from DKK1-involuted mice results in full recovery, suggesting that canonical Wnt signaling is required for the differentiation or proliferation of TEC populations needed for maintenance of properly organized adult thymic epithelial microenvironments. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling within TECs is required for the maintenance of epithelial microenvironments in the postnatal thymus, possibly through effects on TEC progenitor/stem cell populations. Downstream targets of Wnt signaling, which are responsible for maintenance of these TEC progenitors may provide useful targets for therapies aimed at counteracting age associated thymic involution or the premature thymic degeneration associated with cancer therapy and bone marrow transplants.",

To determine whether this suppression is essential for PTH-mediated Wnt signaling and bone formation, we examined mice that overexpress Dkk1 in osteoblasts (Dkk1 mice). Dkk1 mice were osteopenic due to abnormal osteoblast and osteoclast activity. When fed a low-calcium diet, and in two other models of hyperparathyroidism, these mice failed to develop the peritrabecular stromal cell response (\"osteitis fibrosis\") and new bone formation seen in wild-type mice. Despite these effects of Dkk1 overexpression, PTH still activated Wnt signaling in Dkk1 mice and in osteoblastic cells cultured from these mice. In cultured MC3T3E1 preosteoblastic cells, PTH dramatically suppressed Dkk1 expression, induced PKA-mediated phosphorylation of beta-catenin, and significantly enhanced Lef1 expression. Our findings indicate that the full actions of PTH require intact Wnt signaling but that PTH can activate the Wnt pathway despite overexpression of Dkk1.",

In vitro studies suggest that a reduced antagonistic effect of DKK1 on canonical Wnt signaling contributes to the molecular effect of this mutation and its pathogenic consequence. Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) cause high bone mass. Recent studies revealed that a reduced inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) contributes to the pathophysiology of this disease phenotype. We report on a 55-yr-old female patient with a high bone mass phenotype. Sequencing of exons 2-4 of the LRP5 gene was carried out to screen for disease-associated mutations in genomic DNA of the patient. The effect of the identified mutation on LRP5 membrane trafficking was studied by immunoblotting of a truncated form of LRP5. Additionally, Wnt signal activation in the absence and presence of DKK1 was assessed using a TCF4-based reporter gene assay in Saos-2 cells. Our patient presents with dense bones (Z-scores &gt; +6), and radiographic examination showed a generalized thickening of the skeleton. BMD at the hip and lumbar spine significantly decreased through the passage to menopause, indicating no protection to bone loss. Further clinical evaluation revealed torus palatinus. Mutation analysis showed the presence of a novel heterozygous missense variant (844A--&gt;G; M282V) in LRP5, located in the first beta-propeller domain of the extracellular portion. Although protein secretion seemed to be impaired, this mutant was able to transduce Wnt signals at levels comparable with wildtype LRP5. We additionally observed a less efficient inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by DKK1. Like all high BMD-associated gain-of-function LRP5 mutations described thus far, the M282V variant affects an amino acid located in the first beta-propeller domain, underlining the functional importance of this region in the pathophysiology of these conditions. This mutation most likely alters a region important for LRP5 modulation by DKK.",

We subjected purified plasma cells from the bone marrow of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and control subjects to oligonucleotide microarray profiling and biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses to identify molecular determinants of osteolytic lesions. We studied 45 control subjects, 36 patients with multiple myeloma in whom focal lesions of bone could not be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 137 patients in whom MRI detected such lesions. Different patterns of expression of 57 of approximately 10,000 genes from purified myeloma cells could be used to distinguish the two groups of patients (P&lt;0.001). Permutation analysis, which adjusts the significance level to account for multiple comparisons in the data sets, showed that 4 of these 57 genes were significantly overexpressed by plasma cells from patients with focal lesions. One of these genes, dickkopf 1 (DKK1), and its corresponding protein (DKK1) were studied in detail because DKK1 is a secreted factor that has been linked to the function of osteoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens showed that only myeloma cells contained detectable DKK1. Elevated DKK1 levels in bone marrow plasma and peripheral blood from patients with multiple myeloma correlated with the gene-expression patterns of DKK1 and were associated with the presence of focal bone lesions. Recombinant human DKK1 or bone marrow serum containing an elevated level of DKK1 inhibited the differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells in vitro. The production of DKK1, an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation, by myeloma cells is associated with the presence of lytic bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma.",

We found that dkk1 blocks the post-MBT Wnt signaling and dkk1 is a target of the pre-MBT Wnt signaling. Dkk1 overexpression in the prechordal plate suggests that Dkk1, secreted from the prechordal plate, expands the forebrain at the expense of the midbrain in the anterior neural plate. Furthermore, dkk1 acts in parallel to the homeobox gene bozozok and bozozok is required for the maintenance of dkk1 expression.

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stemness maintenance of CSCs remain largely unknown. In the present study, through real-time PCR, western blotting, luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that miR-217 expression was markedly increased in HCC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-217 promoted, while silencing miR-217 suppressed, the fraction of the side population and the expression of cancer stem cell factors in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo in HCC cells. Our findings further demonstrated that miR-217 promoted the CSC-like phenotype via dickkopf-1 (DKK1) targeting, resulting in constitutive activation of Wnt signaling. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were antagonized by the upregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-overexpressing cells. Conversely, the inhibitory effects of silencing miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were reversed by the downregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-downregulated cells. Therefore, our results indicate that miR-217 plays a vital role in the CSC-like phenotypes of HCC cells and may be used as a potential therapeutic target against HCC.",

Metalloproteinases constitute the largest of the five protease families, and the metzincin metalloproteinases are inhibited by the four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase called TIMPs. We hypothesized that Timp genes are essential for skeletal homeostasis. We bred individual Timp knockout mice to generate unique mouse models, the quadruple Timp null strain (QT) as well as mice harboring only a single Timp3 allele (QT3<sup>+/-</sup> ). QT mice are grossly smaller and exhibit a dramatic reduction of trabeculae in long bones by \u03bcCT imaging with a corresponding increase in metalloproteinase activity. At the cellular level, Timp deficiency compromised differentiation markers, matrix deposition and mineralization in neonatal osteoblasts from calvariae, as well as the fibroblastic colony-forming unit (CFU-F) capacity of bone marrow-derived stromal cells. In contrast, we observed that osteoclasts were overactive in the Timp null state, consistent with the noted excessive bone resorption of QT bones. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses of bone sections revealed higher Cathepsin K and RANKL signals upon Timp loss. Seeking the molecular mechanism, we identified abnormal TNF\u03b1 bioactivity to be a central event in Timp-deficient mice. Specifically, TNF\u03b1 triggered induction of the Wnt signaling inhibitor Dkk1 in the osteoblasts at the mRNA and protein levels, with a simultaneous increase in RANKL. Neutralizing TNF\u03b1 antibody was capable of rescuing the induction of Dkk1 as well as RANKL. Therefore, the generation of novel Timp-deficient systems allowed us to uncover the essential and collective function of TIMP proteins in mammalian long-bone homeostasis.

Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a major secreted Wnt signaling antagonist, binds to LRP6 with high affinity and prevents the Frizzled-Wnt-LRP6 complex formation in response to Wnts. Previous studies have demonstrated that Dkk1 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation when it forms a ternary complex with the cell surface receptor Kremen. In the present study, we found that transfected Dkk1 induces LRP6 accumulation while inhibiting Wnt/LRP6 signaling. Treatment with Dkk1-conditioned medium or recombinant Dkk1 protein stabilized LRP6 with a prolonged half-life and induces LRP6 accumulation both at the cell surface and in endosomes. We also demonstrated that Kremen2 co-expression abrogated the effect of Dkk1 on LRP6 accumulation, indicating that the effect of Kremen2 is dominant over Dkk1 regulation of LRP6. Furthermore, we found that Wnt3A treatment induces LRP6 down-regulation, an effect paralleled with a Wnt/LRP6 signaling decay, and that Dkk1 treatment blocked Wnt3A-induced LRP6 down-regulation. Finally, we found that LRP6 turnover was blocked by an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis.

Recurrent genetic alterations in defined genes in association with perturbations of developmental cell signaling pathways have been associated with PDAC development and progression. Here, we show that GATA6 contributes to pancreatic carcinogenesis during the temporal progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia by virtue of Wnt pathway activation. GATA6 is recurrently amplified by both quantitative-PCR and fluorescent in-situ hybridization in human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and in PDAC tissues, and GATA6 copy number is significantly correlated with overall patient survival. Forced overexpression of GATA6 in cancer cell lines enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar in vitro and growth in vivo, as well as increased Wnt signaling. By contrast siRNA mediated knockdown of GATA6 led to corresponding decreases in these same parameters. The effects of GATA6 were found to be due to its ability to bind DNA, as forced overexpression of a DNA-binding mutant of GATA6 had no effects on cell growth in vitro or in vivo, nor did they affect Wnt signaling levels in these same cells. A microarray analysis revealed the Wnt antagonist Dickopf-1 (DKK1) as a dysregulated gene in association with GATA6 knockdown, and direct binding of GATA6 to the DKK1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Transient transfection of GATA6, but not mutant GATA6, into cancer cell lines led to decreased DKK1 mRNA expression and secretion of DKK1 protein into culture media. Forced overexpression of DKK1 antagonized the effects of GATA6 on Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. These findings illustrate that one mechanism by which GATA6 promotes pancreatic carcinogenesis is by virtue of its activation of canonical Wnt signaling via regulation of DKK1.",

Epigenetic silencing of negative Wnt regulators leading to constitutive Wnt signaling has been observed in various cancers and warrants further attention. We have reported that a succinate ether derivative of \u03b1-tocotrienol (T3E) has potent cytotoxic effects in MM cells. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether the anti-MM effect of T3E could be mediated via the epigenetic alteration of the Wnt antagonist gene, Dickkopf-1 (DKK1). WST-1 and cell analyzers were employed to analyze the effects of T3E on cell viability and apoptosis of human MM cell lines (H2452, H28). Real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the expression at mRNA and protein levels. Methylation status and epigenetic modifications of DKK1's promoter regions after T3E treatment in MM cells were studied using methylation-specific PCR and Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown -(siRNA), and specific inhibitors, were used to validate DKK1 as a target of T3E. T3E markedly impaired MM cell viability, increased the expression of phosphorylated-JNK and DKK1 and suppressed cyclin D, a downstream target gene of Wnt signaling. Knockdown of DKK1 expression by siRNA or a specific JNK inhibitor confirmed the contribution of DKK1 and JNK to T3E-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. On the other hand, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) expression, which promotes cell proliferation as a Wnt-independent DKK1 receptor was inhibited by T3E. Silencing CKAP4 by -siRNA did not appear to directly affect MM cell viability, thereby indicating that expression of both DKK1 and CKAP4 is required. Furthermore, T3E-mediated inhibition of both DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, 3A, and 3B) and histone deacetylases (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) in MM cells leads to increased DKK1 expression, thereby promoting tumor growth inhibition. MM cells treated with Zebularine (a DNMT inhibitor) and sodium butyrate (an HDAC inhibitor) exhibited cytotoxic effects, which may explain the inhibitory action of T3E on MM cells. In addition, an enhanced expression of DKK1 in MM cells following T3E treatment is positively correlated with the methylation status of its promoter; T3E decreased DNA methylation and increased histone acetylation. Moreover, T3E specifically increased histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation activity, whereas no effects were observed on histone H3K9 and H3K27. Targeting the epigenetic induction of DKK1 may lead to effective treatment of MM, and T3E has great potential to induce anti-MM activity.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DKK1 in B-CLL cells in vitro. Expression of DKK1 was estimated by Western blot and real-time PCR. B cells from patients with CLL and healthy donors were incubated with recombinant DKK1. Survival was measured by flow cytometry. Primers for real-time PCR were designed for extracellular domain of LRP6, responsible for DKK1 binding, and the intracellular region, essential for inhibiting GSK3 \u03b2. Healthy and CLL cells express equivalent mRNA levels of DKK1 and LRP6. After treatment of CLL cells with recombinant DKK1 (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 3 h, there was no change in the levels of phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin and total \u03b2-catenin. Healthy B cells proved to have significantly higher levels of extracellular, DKK1 binding domain of LRP6. We estimated that in CLL cells every 6th LRP6 receptor is lacking the extracellular domain. For the first time we show the expression of DKK1 in CLL cells. Unlike in similar tumors, the addition of DKK1 to culture of CLL cells does not inactivate WNT pathway. The reason for this could be the absence of the binding domain of LRP6. On the other hand, a truncated LRP6 without extracellular DKK1 binding domain could lead to an uncontrollable activation of WNT signaling.",

The exploration of physiologic functions of Wnt proteins in adult organisms has been hampered by functional redundancy and the necessity for conditional inactivation strategies. Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is a potent secreted Wnt antagonist that interacts with Wnt coreceptors of the LRP family. To address the contribution of Wnt signaling to gastrointestinal epithelial proliferation, adenoviral expression of Dkk1 was used to achieve stringent, conditional, and reversible Wnt inhibition in adult animals. Adenovirus Dkk1 (Ad Dkk1) treatment of adult mice repressed expression of the Wnt target genes CD44 and EphB2 within 2 days in both small intestine and colon, indicating an extremely broad role for Wnt signaling in the maintenance of adult gastrointestinal gene expression. In parallel, Ad Dkk1 markedly inhibited proliferation in small intestine and colon, accompanied by progressive architectural degeneration with the loss of crypts, villi, and glandular structure by 7 days. Whereas decreased Dkk1 expression at later time points (&gt;10 days) was followed by crypt and villus regeneration, which was consistent with a reversible process, substantial mortality ensued from colitis and systemic infection. These results indicate the efficacy of systemic expression of secreted Wnt antagonists as a general strategy for conditional inactivation of Wnt signaling in adult organisms and illustrate a striking reliance on a single growth factor pathway for the maintenance of the architecture of the adult small intestine and colon.",

Intriguingly, while expression of Dkk1 is required for proper neural development, overexpression of Dkk1 is characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and temporal lobe epilepsy. In this review, we will briefly summarize the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, highlight the current literature linking alterations of Dkk1 and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling with neurological disease, and discuss E2's role in maintaining the delicate balance of Dkk1 and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling in the adult brain.

In this study, we have used a combination of computational modeling and molecular biology to reveal direct or indirect crosstalk between these pathways. Specifically, we revealed a mechanism by which IL1\u03b2 upregulates WNT signaling via downregulating WNT antagonists, DKK1 and FRZB. In human chondrocytes, IL1\u03b2 decreased the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and Frizzled related protein (FRZB) through upregulation of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), thereby activating the transcription of WNT target genes. This effect could be reversed by iNOS inhibitor 1400W, which restored DKK1 and FRZB expression and their inhibitory effect on WNT signaling. In addition, 1400W also inhibited both the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and cytokine-induced apoptosis. We concluded that iNOS/NO play a pivotal role in the inflammatory response of human OA through indirect upregulation of WNT signaling. Blocking NO production may inhibit the loss of the articular phenotype in OA by preventing downregulation of the expression of DKK1 and FRZB.",

However, unlike the solely inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling, the effects of DKK1 overexpression on anthrax toxicity were bidirectional, depending on its endogenous expression and cell context. Fluorescence microscopy and biochemical analyses showed that DKK1 facilitates internalization of anthrax toxins and their receptors, an event mediated by DKK1-LRP6-Kremen2 complex. Monoclonal antibodies against DKK1 provided dose-dependent protection to macrophages from killing by anthrax lethal toxin (LT).

Animals (n = 150) were divided into 11 groups and received weekly treatment with either bimagrumab (10 or 100 mg/kg) or vehicle. Progression and outcomes of bone healing were assessed by lateral radiographs in vivo as well as by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), 4-point bending test, and microscopic examination of the excised fibula at Day 29 or later. The radiographic progression of bone healing showed no significant differences between treatment groups in any comparative setting. In 3-month-old animals, pQCT revealed slightly reduced immature callus size and bone mineral content in bimagrumab-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals at Day 29 (p &lt; 0.05). There were, however, no differences in mature callus size, bone mineral density, or biomechanical competency. The aforementioned effects on immature callus size were not present when the treatment was initiated 4 weeks post osteotomy or when treating 6-month-old animals. In summary, these findings suggest that there is no major impact of ActRII blockade on overall fracture healing, and delayed treatment initiation can bypass the small and transient effect of the therapy on immature callus formation observed in younger animals.

Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes, pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab intravenously 10 mg/kg or placebo on Day 1 and Day 29. Pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-adrenal functions were evaluated with basal hormone measurement and standard gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests at baseline, Week 8 and at the end of study (EOS)-Week 20. At Week 8, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were reduced by 42.16 IU/L (P &lt; .001) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased by 2.5 IU/L (P = .08) over placebo in response to bimagrumab in women but not in men. Effects that were reversible after bimagrumab was cleared. Gonadal and adrenal androgen levels were not affected by exposure to bimagrumab. Bimagrumab alters the function of pituitary gonadotroph cells, consistent with blockade of activin on local ActRII. This effect is reversible with clearance of bimagrumab. Bimagrumab did not impact gonadal and adrenal androgen secretion.",

Bimagrumab is a human anti-ActRII antibody which was found to increase muscle mass and function by blocking ActRII signaling. As it has considerable potential for being misused as doping agent in sports, the aim of this study was to develop a mass spectrometric detection assay for doping control serum samples. Within this study, a detection method for Bimagrumab in human serum was developed, which combines ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity purification with proteolytic digestion and LC-HRMS. To facilitate the unambiguous identification of the diagnostic peptides, an orthogonal IM separation was additionally performed. The assay was successfully validated and the analysis of clinical samples demonstrated its fitness for purpose for an application in routine doping control analysis. Although no myostatin inhibitors have obtained clinical approval yet, the proactive development of detection methods for emerging doping agents represents a key aspect of preventive doping research. The presented approach will expand the range of available tests for novel protein therapeutics and can readily be modified to include further target analytes.",

Over expression of MPS1 correlated with a wide range of human tumors makes it an attractive target for finding an effective and specific inhibitor. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of protein MPS1 itself as well as protein bound systems with the inhibitor and natural substrate based on crystal structures. The reported orally bioavailable 1 h-pyrrolo [3,2-c] pyridine inhibitors of MPS1 maintained stable binding in the catalytic site, while natural substrate ATP could not stay. Comparative study of stability and flexibility of three systems reveals position shifting of \u03b2-sheet region within the catalytic site, which indicates inhibition mechanism was through stabilizing the \u03b2-sheet region. Binding free energies calculated with MM-GB/PBSA method shows different binding affinity for inhibitor and ATP. Finally, interactions between protein and inhibitor during molecular dynamic simulations were measured and counted. Residue Gly605 and Leu654 were suggested as important hot spots for stable binding of inhibitor by molecular dynamic simulation. Our results reveal an important position shifting within catalytic site for non-inhibited proteins. Together with hot spots found by molecular dynamic simulation, the results provide important information of inhibition mechanism and will be referenced for designing novel inhibitors.",

One of the best characterised checkpoint pathways is the spindle assembly checkpoint, which prevents anaphase onset until the appropriate attachment and tension across kinetochores is achieved. MPS1 kinase activity is essential for the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and has been shown to be deregulated in human tumours with chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. Therefore, MPS1 inhibition represents an attractive strategy to target cancers. To evaluate CCT271850 cellular potency, two specific antibodies that recognise the activation sites of MPS1 were used and its antiproliferative activity was determined in 91 human cancer cell lines. DLD1 cells with induced GFP-MPS1 and HCT116 cells were used in in vivo studies to directly measure MPS1 inhibition and efficacy of CCT271850 treatment. CCT271850 selectively and potently inhibits MPS1 kinase activity in biochemical and cellular assays and in in vivo models. Mechanistically, tumour cells treated with CCT271850 acquire aberrant numbers of chromosomes and the majority of cells divide their chromosomes without proper alignment because of abrogation of the mitotic checkpoint, leading to cell death. We demonstrated a moderate level of efficacy of CCT271850 as a single agent in a human colorectal carcinoma xenograft model. CCT271850 is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable MPS1 kinase inhibitor. On the basis of in vivo pharmacodynamic vs efficacy relationships, we predict that more than 80% inhibition of MPS1 activity for at least 24 h is required to achieve tumour stasis or regression by CCT271850.",

A 20-year-old male underwent subtotal resection (STR) in 1997 and 2002 of DNT resulting in temporary control of intractable epilepsy despite antiepileptic drug treatment (AED). Long-term seizure control was obtained after GKRS of two separate residual DNT components along the surgical margin (2005 and 2010). A 27-year-old male undergoing gross total resection of the contrast-enhancing portion of a DNT (1999) resulted in temporary control of intractable epilepsy despite AEDs; lasting clinical control of seizures was achieved in 2002 after GKRS of a small, recurrent DNT component. A 28-year-old male underwent STR of DNT (1994 and 2004) resulting in temporary control of intractable epilepsy. Lasting seizure control was gained after GKRS of a residual tumor (2005).

Microbiomic descriptions are now available in patients with small, medium and large vessel vasculitis. The majority of studies have evaluated gastrointestinal inhabitants, with a smaller number of studies describing the nasal, pulmonary or vascular microbiomes. Most published studies are observational and cross-sectional. Dysbiosis is seen frequently in vasculitis patients with reduced microbial diversity observed in nasal, fecal and vascular samples compared with disease and/or healthy controls. Predominant bacteria vary, but overall, patients with vasculitis tend to have more pathogenic and less commensal bacteria in active disease. In the few longitudinal studies available, improvement or resolution of dysbiosis has been observed following vasculitis treatment and improved disease activity. Dysbiosis and reduced microbial diversity has been identified in patients with small, medium and large vessel vasculitis. Although limited data suggests microbiomes may 'normalize' following immunosuppression, cause or effect cannot be determined. It is hypothesized that microbial disruption in a genetically susceptible individual may trigger excessive host immune activation and vasculitis; however, larger studies with longitudinal and translational design are needed to further our current understanding.",

Traumatic injury, such as burn, elicits a number of changes in the gut, including a shift in the composition of the microbiome (dysbiosis), increased gut leakiness, and bacterial translocation into the lymphatic system and bloodstream. These effects are believed to contribute to devastating secondary complications following burn, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and septic shock. Clinical studies demonstrate that advanced age causes a significant increase in mortality following burn, but the role of the gut in this age-dependent susceptibility has not been investigated. In this study, we combined our well-established murine model of scald burn injury with bacterial 16S-rRNA gene sequencing to investigate how burn injury affects the fecal microbiome in aged versus young mice. Of our treatment groups, the most substantial shift in gut microbial populations was observed in aged mice that underwent burn injury. We then profiled antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the ileum, and found that burn injury stimulated a 20-fold rise in levels of regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (Reg3\u03b3), a 16-fold rise in regenerating islet-derived protein 3 beta (Reg3\u03b2), and an 8-fold rise in Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (Cramp) in young, but not aged mice. Advanced age alone elicited 5-fold higher levels of alpha defensin-related sequence1 (Defa-rs1) in the ileum, but this increase was lost following burn. Comparison of bacterial genera abundance and AMP expression across treatment groups revealed distinct correlation patterns between AMPs and individual genera. Our results reveal that burn injury drives microbiome dysbiosis and altered AMP expression in an age-dependent fashion, and highlight potential mechanistic targets contributing to the increased morbidity and mortality observed in elderly burn patients.",

Our objective was to evaluate whether the clinical data support the utility of oral and topical probiotics for certain dermatological diseases. The PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for basic science, translational research and clinical studies that investigated differences in the cutaneous microbiome and the impact of probiotics in patients with atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, psoriasis, chronic wounds, seborrhoeic dermatitis and cutaneous neoplasms. Few clinical trials exist that explore the utility of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of dermatological diseases, with the exception of atopic dermatitis. Most studies investigated oral probiotic interventions, and of those utilizing topical probiotics, few included skin commensals.

'Steady-state' granulopoiesis is absolutely dependent on the C/EBPalpha transcription factor, but the transcriptional mechanisms underlying emergency granulopoiesis remain unclear. Here we show that large numbers of granulocytes were generated from C/EBPalpha-deficient progenitors after cytokine stimulation in vivo. Cytokine treatment or fungal infection induced upregulation of C/EBPbeta but not C/EBPalpha or C/EBPepsilon transcripts in granulocyte progenitors, and C/EBPbeta-deficient progenitors showed decreased emergency-induced granulopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. C/EBPbeta inhibited proliferation less severely than did C/EBPalpha. These data suggest a critical function for C/EBPbeta in emergency granulopoiesis, which demands both differentiation and proliferation of granulocyte precursors.",

Using a murine model with conditional deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in bone marrow, we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of STAT3 function in the emergency granulopoiesis response to G-CSF administration or infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogen that is restrained by G-CSF signaling in vivo. Our results show that STAT3 deficiency renders hematopoietic progenitor cells and myeloid precursors refractory to the growth-promoting functions of G-CSF or L monocytogenes infection. STAT3 is necessary for accelerating granulocyte cell-cycle progression and maturation in response to G-CSF. STAT3 directly controls G-CSF-dependent expression of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2), a crucial factor in the emergency granulopoiesis response. Moreover, STAT3 and C/EBP\u03b2 coregulate c-Myc through interactions with the c-myc promoter that control the duration of C/EBP\u03b1 occupancy during demand-driven granulopoiesis. These results place STAT3 as an essential mediator of emergency granulopoiesis by its regulation of transcription factors that direct G-CSF-responsive myeloid progenitor expansion.",

Granulocyte production increases following infection or in response to cytokine stimulation, and activation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) transcription factor is required for such stress-induced granulopoiesis, whereas C/EBP\u03b1 plays a critical role in maintaining steady-state granulopoiesis. Different roles of these C/EBP transcription factors in different modes of hematopoiesis are evolutionally conserved from zebrafish to humans. In addition to reactions against infections, C/EBP\u03b2 is responsible for cancer-driven myelopoiesis, which promotes cancer progression, at least in part, by abrogating the immune response in the cancer microenvironment. The BCR-ABL fusion protein activates emergency-specific pathway of granulopoiesis by upregulating C/EBP\u03b2. This in turn causes chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia, which is characterized by myeloid expansion. The C/EBP\u03b2 transcription factor also plays a role in other hematological malignancies of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage origin.

Intriguingly, CN patients have the same bone marrow and blood phenotypes irrespective of inheritance. This suggests that mutations in various genes may lead to the dysregulation of the common myeloid transcription factor(s) in CN. To the extensively studied myeloid-specific transcription factors belong CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) (-alpha, -beta, -epsilon) and PU.1. The relative levels of PU.1 and C/EBPalpha in granulocytic-macrophage progenitors have been suggested to regulate monocyte versus neutrophil cell-fate choice. In CN patients, the myelopoietic maturation program is sharply shifted toward monocytopoiesis, with increased levels of monocytes and no granulocytes in the peripheral blood. We found that in myeloid cells from CN patients C/EBPalpha and its target gene inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) are abrogated due to a lack of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1) expression but PU.1 is slightly upregulated. Based on these findings, we conclude that in LEF-1-deficient myeloid cells from CN patients misbalanced C/EBPalpha/Id1:PU.1 ratio with a strong shift toward PU.1 could play a decisive role in the improper regulation of myelopoiesis with defective granulocytopoiesis and elevated monocytic differentiation. Recently, we identified nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), also known as pre-B cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF), as an essential enzyme mediating granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-triggered granulopoiesis in healthy individuals and in individuals with CN. Since CN patients respond to G-CSF treatment even in the absence of LEF-1 and C/EBPalpha, we conclude that treatment of CN patients with pharmacological doses of G-CSF activates NAMPT/NAD(+)/SIRT1-dependent \"emergency\" granulopoiesis via C/EBPbeta.",

To determine whether 24 months of minocycline treatment can modify cognitive and functional decline in patients with mild AD. Participants were recruited into a double-blind randomized clinical trial from May 23, 2014, to April 14, 2016, with 24 months of treatment and follow-up. This multicenter study in England and Scotland involved 32 National Health Service memory clinics within secondary specialist services for people with dementia. From 886 screened patients, 554 patients with a diagnosis of mild AD (Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination [sMMSE] score \u226524) were randomized. Participants were randomly allocated 1:1:1 in a semifactorial design to receive minocycline (400 mg/d or 200 mg/d) or placebo for 24 months. Primary outcome measures were decrease in sMMSE score and Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS), analyzed by intention-to-treat repeated-measures regression. Of 544 eligible participants (241 women and 303 men), the mean (SD) age was 74.3 (8.2) years, and the mean (SD) sMMSE score was 26.4 (1.9).

Understanding of such classifications offers insights into the pathogenesis of liver disease, as well as diagnostic or therapeutic implications. Apoptosis is recognized relatively easily due to its unique morphology, but lytic cell death may occur in the form of accidental necrosis, mitochondria permeability transition-driven necrosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and parthanatos. The cell may be engulfed by neighboring cells due to a loss of integrin signaling or cancer cell competition by entosis, a type of cell death. The classification also includes mechanistically termed cell death such as autophagy-dependent cell death and lysosome-dependent cell death. These different types of cell death may occur uniquely in certain liver diseases but may coexist in the evolution of the disease. They occur in parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells, as well as inflammatory cells, causing distinct pathologic consequences.

Here, we confirmed that pyroptosis had occurred in the media of pulmonary arteries in two PH rat models and hypoxic human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs). Caspase-1 inhibition attenuated the pathogenesis of PH, as assessed by vascular remodeling, right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricle hypertrophy and hemodynamic parameters of pulmonary vasculature. Moreover, caspase-1 inhibition suppressed pulmonary vascular fibrosis as demonstrated by Masson staining, as well as immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of fibrillar collagen. In addition, Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was markedly increased in PH, which was regulated by the transcription factor STAT1. Furthermore, PD-L1 knockdown in hPASMCs repressed the onset of hypoxia-induced pyroptosis and fibrosis. Overall, these data identify a critical STAT1-dependent posttranscriptional modification that promotes PD-L1 expression in the pyroptosis of PASMCs to modulate pulmonary vascular fibrosis and accelerate the progression of PH.",

These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function.

The EGP identified a total of 45,243 SNPs, of which 10,780 were common SNPs (minor allele frequency &gt;or=0.1).

Our analysis shows that HapMap data are not robust enough to capture the untyped variants for most of the human genes.

Epilepsy is the commonest serious neurological disorder worldwide.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16877472": "With the availability of the HapMap--a resource which describes common patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in four different human population samples, we now have a powerful tool to help dissect the role of genetic variation in the biology of the genome. HapMap is entirely complimentary to the human genome map and so it is particularly fitting that it should be viewed in a full genomic context. However, characterization of high resolution LD across the genome can be a challenging task, owing in part to the sheer volume of data and the inherent dimensionality that its analysis entails. However, a number of tools are now available to make this task easier for researchers. This review will examine tools for viewing and analysing haplotype and LD data, enabling a number of tasks; including identification of optimal sets of haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); drawing links between associated SNPs and putative causal alleles; or simply viewing LD and haplotypes across a gene or region of interest. The data generated by the HapMap also has other important applications, informing, for example, on the demographic history and evidence of selection in human populations and on previously undetected regulatory relationships and gene networks. All of these properties make the HapMap no less an important resource than the human genome sequence itself and so this makes it essential viewing for all in the field of human biology.",

We have constructed whole-genome genotyping panels of over 550,000 (HumanHap550) and 650,000 (HumanHap650Y) SNP loci by choosing tag SNPs from all populations genotyped by the International HapMap Project. These panels also contain additional SNP content in regions that have historically been overrepresented in diseases, such as nonsynonymous sites, the MHC region, copy number variant regions and mitochondrial DNA. We estimate that the tag SNP loci in these panels cover the majority of all common variation in the genome as measured by coverage of both all common HapMap SNPs and an independent set of SNPs derived from complete resequencing of genes obtained from SeattleSNPs. We also estimate that, given a sample size of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, these panels have the power to detect single disease loci of moderate risk (lambda approximately 1.8-2.0). Relative risks as low as lambda approximately 1.1-1.3 can be detected using 10,000 cases and 10,000 controls depending on the sample population and disease model. If multiple loci are involved, the power increases significantly to detect at least one locus such that relative risks 20%-35% lower can be detected with 80% power if between two and four independent loci are involved. Although our SNP selection was based on HapMap data, which is a subset of all common SNPs, these panels effectively capture the majority of all common variation and provide high power to detect risk alleles that are not represented in the HapMap data.",

The contribution of the traditionally overlooked copy number variations (CNVs) to complex traits is also being actively studied. To facilitate the interpretation of the data and the designing of follow-up experimental validations, we have developed a database that enables the sensible prioritization of these variants by combining several approaches, involving not only publicly available physical and functional annotations but also multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) annotations as well as annotations of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). For each SNP, the SCAN database provides: (i) summary information from eQTL mapping of HapMap SNPs to gene expression (evaluated by the Affymetrix exon array) in the full set of HapMap CEU (Caucasians from UT, USA) and YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) samples; (ii) LD information, in the case of a HapMap SNP, including what genes have variation in strong LD (pairwise or multilocus LD) with the variant and how well the SNP is covered by different high-throughput platforms; (iii) summary information available from public databases (e.g. physical and functional annotations); and (iv) summary information from other GWAS. For each gene, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) eQTLs for the gene (both local and distant SNPs) and (ii) the coverage of all variants in the HapMap at that gene on each high-throughput platform. For each genomic region, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) physical and functional annotations of all SNPs, genes and known CNVs within the region and (ii) all genes regulated by the eQTLs within the region. http://www.scandb.org.

The HapMap project is one of the largest public resources of human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterizing over 3 million SNPs genotyped in over 1000 individuals. The standard format and biological properties of HapMap data suggest that a dedicated genetic compression method can outperform generic compression tools. We propose a compression methodology for genetic data by introducing HapZipper, a lossless compression tool tailored to compress HapMap data beyond benchmarks defined by generic tools such as gzip, bzip2 and lzma.

HapMap can also be used for tag SNP selection in candidate genes, although its performance has yet to be evaluated against gene resequencing data, where there is near-complete SNP ascertainment. The Environmental Genome Project (EGP) is the largest gene resequencing effort to date with over 500 resequenced genes. We used HapMap data to select tag SNPs and calculated the proportions of common SNPs (MAF&gt;or=0.05) tagged (rho2&gt;or=0.8) for each of 127 EGP Panel 2 genes where individual ethnic information was available. Median gene-tagging proportions are 50, 80 and 74% for African, Asian, and European groups, respectively. These low gene-tagging proportions may be problematic for some candidate gene studies. In addition, although HapMap targeted nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), we estimate only approximately 30% of nonsynonymous SNPs in EGP are in high LD with any HapMap SNP. We show that gene-tagging proportions can be improved by adding a relatively small number of tag SNPs that were selected based on resequencing data. We also demonstrate that ethnic-mixed data can be used to improve HapMap gene-tagging proportions, but are not as efficient as ethnic-specific data. Finally, we generalized the greedy algorithm proposed by Carlson et al (2004) to select tag SNPs for multiple populations and implemented the algorithm into a freely available software package mPopTag.",

Within the project, ~3.9 million distinct single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been genotyped in 270 individuals from four worldwide populations. The project data are available for unrestricted public use at the HapMap website. This site, which is the primary portal to genotype data produced by the project, offers bulk downloads of the data set, as well as interactive data browsing and analysis tools that are not available elsewhere. Research into the genetic contributions to a human disease commonly focuses on candidate genes identified from linkage and/or association studies, as well as from pathways suspected to be involved in a particular disease process. In studying candidate genes, a researcher will want to know whether there are any common SNPs in the immediate vicinity, what those SNPs' alleles are, and the relative frequencies of the alleles in the population. The researcher will also be particularly interested in coding SNPs, whose alleles change the amino acid sequence of the gene product and therefore might represent functional variations.

It is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder with variable expression that is caused by germline mutations in the TWIST1 gene or more rarely in the FGFR2 or FGFR3 genes. We have previously reported that patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Here we have analysed a cohort of 26 women with BRCA1/2-negative hereditary breast cancer to study whether a proportion of these families might have mutations in Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes. DNA sequence analysis of TWIST1 showed no pathogenic mutations in the coding sequence in any of the 26 patients. MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification)-analysis also showed no alterations in copy numbers in any of the craniofacial disorder genes MSX2, ALX4, RUNX2, EFNB1, TWIST1, FGFR1, FGFR2,FGFR3, or FGFR4.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21502402": "Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, promotes breast tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasiveness, and metastasis. However, the mechanisms responsible for regulating Twist1 stability are unknown in these cells. We identified the serine 68 (Ser 68) as a major phosphorylation site of Twist1 by mass spectrometry and with specific antibodies. This Ser 68 is phosphorylated by p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 in vitro, and its phosphorylation levels positively correlate with Twist1 protein levels in human embryonic kidney 293 and breast cancer cells. Prevention of Ser 68 phosphorylation by an alanine (A) mutation (Ser 68A) dramatically accelerates Twist1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) by an active Ras protein or TGF-\u03b2 treatment significantly increases Ser 68 phosphorylation and Twist1 protein levels without altering Twist1 mRNA expression, whereas blocking of MAPK activities by either specific inhibitors or dominant negative inhibitory mutants effectively reduces the levels of both induced and uninduced Ser 68 phosphorylation and Twist protein. Accordingly, the mammary epithelial cells expressing Twist1 exhibit much higher degrees of EMT and invasiveness on stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 or the active Ras and paclitaxel resistance compared with the same cells expressing the Ser 68A-Twist1 mutant. Importantly, the levels of Ser 68 phosphorylation in the invasive human breast ductal carcinomas positively correlate with the levels of Twist1 protein and JNK activity and are significantly higher in progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers. These findings suggest that activation of MAPKs by tyrosine kinase receptors and Ras signaling pathways may substantially promote breast tumor cell EMT and metastasis via phoshorylation and stabilization of Twist1.",

TGF-\u03b21 stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation and HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Silencing either STAT3 or HIF-1\u03b1 efficiently attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced TWIST1 expression. Further ectopic expression of a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 reduced TGF-\u03b21-induced TWIST1 expression. In addition, STAT3 and HIF-1\u03b1 up-regulated TWIST1 expression by direct binding to a TWIST1 promoter. Strikingly, STAT3 also enhanced TGF-\u03b21-induced TWIST1 expression through HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization. Collectively, we demonstrate a mechanistic cascade of TGF-\u03b21 up-regulating STAT3 activation and HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and subsequent TWIST1 expression, leading to prostate cancer invasion.",

Overexpression and activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor-1 (EGFR1) are frequently observed and associated with poor prognosis. To inhibit the function of EGFR1, multiple antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target EGFR1 have been developed. Even though some patients respond to these TKI, subsequent studies reveal that this is not the case for all nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we determine whether activation and expression levels of EGFR1, ERK, AKT, STAT3, and TWIST1 are dependent on the activating mutations of EGFR1. Protein lysates and DNA have been isolated from tumor and corresponding normal tissues of 16 NSCLC patients. Genomic-DNA is used to sequence the exons 18, 19, and 21 of EGFR1, and exon 2 of k-RAS. Protein lysates were used to determine the expression or phosphorylation levels of EGFR, STAT3, ERK, AKT, and TWIST1. Our results revealed that 16 tumor samples of NSCLC patients showed no mutation in any of the indicated exons of EGFR1 and k-RAS albeit significant levels of activation or expression of the above-mentined oncogenes. In NSCLC patients, the tumor micro-environment can be as important as the activating mutations of EGFR1. TK therapy may also be considered for patients who show high levels of activation of EGFR1 even in the absence of activating mutations.",

Although targeted agents exist for EGFR- and EML4-ALK-driven NSCLCs, no therapies target the most frequently found driver mutation, KRAS. Furthermore, acquired resistance to the currently targetable driver mutations is nearly universally observed. Clearly a novel therapeutic approach is needed to target oncogene-driven NSCLCs. We recently showed that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse models and that inhibition of Twist1 in these models led to Kras-induced senescence. In the current study, we examine the role of TWIST1 in oncogene-driven human NSCLCs. Silencing of TWIST1 in KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cell lines resulted in dramatic growth inhibition and either activation of a latent oncogene-induced senescence program or, in some cases, apoptosis. Similar effects were observed in EGFR mutation-driven and c-Met-amplified NSCLC cell lines. Growth inhibition by silencing of TWIST1 was independent of p53 or p16 mutational status and did not require previously defined mediators of senescence, p21 and p27, nor could this phenotype be rescued by overexpression of SKP2. In xenograft models, silencing of TWIST1 resulted in significant growth inhibition of KRAS-mutant, EGFR-mutant, and c-Met-amplified NSCLCs. Remarkably, inducible silencing of TWIST1 resulted in significant growth inhibition of established KRAS-mutant tumors. Together these findings suggest that silencing of TWIST1 in oncogene driver-dependent NSCLCs represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25622896": "The TWIST1 gene has diverse roles in development and pathologic diseases such as cancer. TWIST1 is a dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor existing as TWIST1-TWIST1 or TWIST1-E12/47. TWIST1 partner choice and DNA binding can be influenced during development by phosphorylation of Thr125 and Ser127 of the Thr-Gln-Ser (TQS) motif within the bHLH of TWIST1. The significance of these TWIST1 phosphorylation sites for metastasis is unknown. We created stable isogenic prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing TWIST1 wild-type, phospho-mutants, and tethered versions. We assessed these isogenic lines using assays that mimic stages of cancer metastasis. In vitro assays suggested the phospho-mimetic Twist1-DQD mutation could confer cellular properties associated with pro-metastatic behavior. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic Twist1-AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type TWIST1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the TWIST1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions. In vivo analysis demonstrates that the Twist1-AQA mutation exhibits reduced capacity to contribute to metastasis, whereas the expression of the Twist1-DQD mutation exhibits proficient metastatic potential. Tethered TWIST1-E12 heterodimers phenocopied the Twist1-DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that TWIST1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, the dual phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ235 strongly attenuated TWIST1-induced migration that was dependent on the TQS motif. TWIST1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of TWIST1-induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by TWIST1 dimeric partner choice.",

In this study, we examined the role of Twist1, a central regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in carcinoma cells, in the transdifferentiation of normal quiescent fibroblasts to CAF and we defined its upstream controls and downstream effectors. Primary human gastric fibroblast and CAF cultures were established from gastrectomy specimens and validated as nontumor cells by somatic mutation analyses. In these cultures, exposure to the proinflammatory cytokine IL6 commonly expressed in tumors was sufficient to induce Twist1 expression in normal fibroblasts and transdifferentiate them into CAFs via STAT3 phosphorylation. In xenograft models, tumor infiltration of Twist1-expressing CAFs was enhanced strongly by ectopic IL6 expression in gastric or breast cancer cells. We found that Twist1 expression was necessary and sufficient for CAF transdifferentiation. Enforced expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts was also sufficient to drive CAF marker expression and malignant character in gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, silencing the expression of Twist1 in CAFs abrogated their tumor-promoting properties. Downstream of Twist1, we defined the chemokine CXCL12 as a transcriptional target. Clinically, CXCL12 and Twist1 expression were correlated in CAFs present in gastric tumor specimens. Finally, ectopic expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts suppressed premature senescence, whereas Twist1 attenuation accelerated senescence in CAFs.

Given the potential of TWIST1 as a therapeutic target, a chemical-bioinformatic approach using connectivity mapping (CMAP) analysis was used to identify TWIST1 inhibitors. Characterization of the top ranked candidates from the unbiased screen revealed that harmine, a harmala alkaloid, inhibited multiple TWIST1 functions, including single-cell dissemination, suppression of normal branching in 3D epithelial culture, and proliferation of oncogene driver-defined NSCLC cells. Harmine treatment phenocopied genetic loss of <i>TWIST1</i> by inducing oncogene-induced senescence or apoptosis. Mechanistic investigation revealed that harmine targeted the TWIST1 pathway through its promotion of TWIST1 protein degradation. As dimerization is critical for TWIST1 function and stability, the effect of harmine on specific TWIST1 dimers was examined. TWIST1 and its dimer partners, the E2A proteins, which were found to be required for TWIST1-mediated functions, regulated the stability of the other heterodimeric partner posttranslationally. Harmine preferentially promoted degradation of the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer compared with the TWIST-TWIST1 homodimer, and targeting the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer was required for harmine cytotoxicity. Finally, harmine had activity in both transgenic and patient-derived xenograft mouse models of <i>KRAS</i>-mutant NSCLC. These studies identified harmine as a first-in-class TWIST1 inhibitor with marked anti-tumor activity in oncogene-driven NSCLC including <i>EGFR</i> mutant, <i>KRAS</i> mutant and <i>MET</i> altered NSCLC.<b>Implications:</b> TWIST1 is required for oncogene-driven NSCLC tumorigenesis and EMT; thus, harmine and its analogues/derivatives represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat oncogene-driven NSCLC as well as other solid tumor malignancies. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 15(12); 1764-76. \u00a92017 AACR</i>.",

ETS transcription factors are divided into subfamilies based on the sequence and location of the ETS domain. ETV5 (Ets variant gene 5; also known as ERM) is a member of the PEA3 subfamily. Our meta-analysis of normal, benign, and malignant thyroid samples demonstrated that ETV5 expression is upregulated in papillary thyroid cancer and was predominantly associated with BRAF V600E or RAS mutations. However, the precise role of ETV5 in these lesions is unknown. In this study, we used the KTC1 cell line as a model for human advanced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) because the cells harbor the heterozygous BRAF (V600E) mutation together with the C250T TERT promoter mutation. The role of ETV5 in PTC proliferation was tested using RNAi followed by high-throughput screening. Signaling pathways driving ETV5 expression were identified using specific pharmacological inhibitors. To determine if ETV5 influences the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) markers in these cells, an EMT PCR array was used, and data were confirmed by qPCR and ChIP-qPCR. We found that ETV5 is critical for PTC cell growth, is expressed downstream of the MAPK pathway, and directly upregulates the transcription factor TWIST1, a known marker of intravasation and metastasis. Increased ETV5 expression could therefore be considered as a marker for advanced PTCs and a possible future therapeutic target.",

To explore the mechanism of drug resistance, we constructed the crizotinib resistance cell line, A549-CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation cells, by the methods of fusion polymerase chain reaction (PCR), plasmid construction and cell transfection in vitro. The results showed that the expression of CD74-ROS1 or CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation in A549 cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), dramatically enhanced the ability of invasion and migration, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and Twist1 transcription factor. Moreover, we found that inhibition of Twist1 could reverse EMT induced by CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation. Combination of Twist1 siRNA and crizotinib significantly reduced cell vitality, inhibited cell invasion and migration, and promoted apoptosis in A549-CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation cells. Taken together, these results suggested that CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation mediated EMT phenotype by increasing the expression of Twist1, resulting in drug resistance.

Etv6 target gene was validated by ChIP and promoter reporter assays. Correlation of ETV6 and TWIST1 was analyzed in human clinical datasets and tissue samples. Migration, invasion, and metastasis assays were used to measure the cellular responses after perturbation of ETV6 -TWIST1 axis. Proliferation and tumor growth in xenograft model were performed to evaluate the drug sensitivities of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). ETV6 inhibits TWIST1 expression and disruption of ETV6 promotes TWIST1-dependent malignant phenotypes. Importantly, ETV6 is required to the anti-proliferation effects of EGFR-TKIs, partly due to the inhibitory function of ETV6 on TWIST1. We also found that EGFR-RAS signaling is tightly controlled by ETV6, supporting its role in TKI sensitivity. Our study demonstrates that disruption of ETV6 contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, which is likely due to derepression of TWIST1 and activation of EGFR-RAS signaling. Our results implicate ETV6 as a potential marker for predicting efficacy of an EGFR-targeted anticancer approach.

In this study, we employed a combination of techniques to study the role of PVT1 in prostate cancer, which included bioinformatic analysis, Western blotting and cell migration assays of prostate cancer cell lines. We report that PVT1 promotes prostate cancer invasion and metastasis by modulating EMT. Furthermore, PVT1 can promote EMT by up-regulation of Twist1, a transcription factor associated with EMT. We then confirmed that PVT1 acts as a sponge for miRNA-186-5p and positively regulates Twist1 by a sponge effect.

The protein expression levels were analysed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation were employed to validate the target of Sox5. The effect of Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 on PCa progression was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Here, we found that TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT was accompanied by increased Sox5 expression. Interestingly, knockdown of Sox5 expression attenuated EMT induced by TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Smad3 could bind to the promoter of Sox5 and regulate its expression. Mechanistically, Sox5 could bind to Twist1 promoter and active Twist1, which initiated EMT. Importantly, knockdown of Sox5 in prostate cancer cells resulted in less of the mesenchymal phenotype and cell migration ability. Furthermore, targeting Sox5 could inhibit prostate cancer progression in a xenograft mouse model. In clinic, patients with high Sox5 expression were more likely to suffer from metastases, and high Sox5 expression also has a lower progression-free survival and cancer specific-survival in clinic database. Therefore, we propose a new mechanism in which Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 promotes EMT and contributes to PCa progression.",

Twist1 is expressed in breast, liver, prostate, gastric and other types of cancers, and its expression is usually associated with invasive and metastatic cancer phenotypes. In cancer cells, Twist1 is upregulated by multiple factors including SRC-1, STAT3, MSX2, HIF-1\u03b1, integrin-linked kinase and NF-\u03baB. Twist1 significantly enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer cell migration and invasion, hence promoting cancer metastasis. Twist1 promotes EMT in part by directly repressing E-cadherin expression by recruiting the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex for gene repression and by upregulating Bmi1, AKT2, YB-1, etc. Emerging evidence also suggests that Twist1 plays a role in expansion and chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer stem cells. Further understanding of the mechanisms by which Twist1 promotes metastasis and identification of Twist1 functional modulators may hold promise for developing new strategies to inhibit EMT and cancer metastasis.",

This syndrome has hitherto not been associated with an increased risk of cancer. However, recent studies, using a murine breast tumor model, have shown that Twist may act as a key regulator of metastasis and that the gene is overexpressed in subsets of sporadic human breast cancers. Here, we report a novel association between the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and breast cancer. In 15 Swedish Saethre-Chotzen families, 15 of 29 (52%) women carriers over the age of 25 had developed breast cancer. At least four patients developed breast cancer before 40 years of age, and five between 40 and 50 years of age. The observed cases with breast cancer (n = 15) are significantly higher than expected (n = 0.89), which gives a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 16.80 (95% CI 1.54-32.06). Our finding of a high frequency of breast cancer in women with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome identifies breast cancer as an important and previously unrecognized symptom characteristic of this syndrome. The results strongly suggest that women carriers of this syndrome would benefit from genetic counseling and enrolment in surveillance programs including yearly mammography. Our results also indicate that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene. Additional studies are, however, necessary to reveal the mechanism by which TWIST1 may predispose to early onset breast cancer in Saethre-Chotzen patients.",

In this study, the feline TWIST1 gene was screened for sequence variations in 37 neoplastic and eight hyperplastic mammary gland lesions from cats. In addition, mRNA levels were examined in 15 mammary tumours and three cases of mammary hyperplasia by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. Feline mammary carcinomas had significantly lower levels of expression of TWIST1 mRNA than benign mammary tumours. No variations were identified in the TWIST1 coding region in feline mammary tumours and the mutation described in humans was not detected. However, two germline variants in the TWIST1 gene intron were identified in four and three carcinomas, respectively: GQ167299:g.535delG and GQ167299:g.460C&gt;T. There was no association between these sequence alterations and TWIST1 mRNA levels.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27524420": "The heterogeneous breast cancers can be classified into different subtypes according to their histopathological characteristics and molecular signatures. Foxa1 expression is linked with luminal breast cancer (LBC) with good prognosis, whereas Twist1 expression is associated with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) with poor prognosis owing to its role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasiveness and metastasis. However, the regulatory and functional relationships between Twist1 and Foxa1 in breast cancer progression are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that in the estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1)-positive LBC cells Twist1 silences Foxa1 expression, which has an essential role in relieving Foxa1-arrested migration, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, Twist1 binds to Foxa1 proximal promoter and recruits the NuRD transcriptional repressor complex to de-acetylate H3K9 and repress RNA polymerase II recruitment. Twist1 also silences Foxa1 promoter by inhibiting AP-1 recruitment. Twist1 expression in MCF7 cells silenced Foxa1 expression, which was concurrent with the induction of EMT, migration, invasion and metastasis of these cells. Importantly, restored Foxa1 expression in these cells largely inhibited Twist1-promoted migration, invasion and metastasis. Restored Foxa1 expression did not change the Twist1-induced mesenchymal cellular morphology and the expression of Twist1-regulated E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, vimentin and Slug, but it partially rescued Twist1-silenced ER\u03b1 and cytokeratin 8 expression and reduced Twist1-induced integrin \u03b15, integrin \u03b21 and MMP9 expression. In a xenografted mouse model, restored Foxa1 also increased Twist1-repressed LBC markers and decreased Twist1-induced BLBC markers. Furthermore, Twist1 expression is negatively correlated with Foxa1 in the human breast tumors. The tumors with high Twist1 and low Foxa1 expressions are associated with poor distant metastasis-free survival. These results demonstrate that Twist1's silencing effect on Foxa1 expression is largely responsible for Twist1-induced migration, invasion and metastasis, but less responsible for Twist1-induced mesenchymal morphogenesis and expression of certain EMT markers.",

This study aimed to find out whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes SNAI1 and TWIST1 may affect BC and OC susceptibility. A total of 7 tagging\u2011SNPs (tSNPs) were directly genotyped in 1,161 BC cases, 286 OC cases and 1,273 cancer\u2011free controls among Chinese Han women. Twenty\u2011eight variants in these 2 genes were genotyped by 'in silico' genotype imputation. Logistic regression (LR) revealed that tSNPs SNAI1 rs6125849, TWIST1 rs4721746 and TWIST1 rs4721745 were protective genetic variants for BC/OC. Allelic association tests of gene\u2011wide SNPs demonstrated that the minor alleles of SNAI1 rs6125849, TWIST1 rs4721745 and TWIST1 rs11973396 were strongly associated with BC/OC susceptibility. Multivariate LR presented that SNAI1 rs6125849, TWIST1 rs4721745, rs4721746 and rs11973396 affected BC/OC susceptibility independently, and women harboring all four protective genoytpes had the lowest risk. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis further showed that SNAI1 rs6125849 and TWIST1 rs4721745 had the strongest synergistic interaction. Functional annotation predicted that the minor alleles of SNAI1 rs6125849 and TWIST1 rs4721745 altered their binding affinities with transcription factors E2F6 and TCF11\u2011MafG respectively. These results indicate that genetic variants in SNAI1 and TWIST1, most probably SNAI1 rs6125849 and TWIST1 rs4721745, may modulate BC and OC susceptibility.",

Mice with germ-line Twist1 knockout are embryonic lethal, while adult mice with inducible Twist1 knockout have no obvious health problems, suggesting that Twist1 is a viable therapeutic target for the inhibition of invasion and metastasis of breast cancer in adult patients. In this study, we expressed a luciferase protein or a Twist1-luciferase fusion protein in HeLa cells as part of a high throughput system to screen 1280 compounds in the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) from Sigma-Aldrich for their effects on Twist1 protein expression. One of the most interesting compounds identified is tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator used to treat ER-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen treatment significantly accelerated Twist1 degradation in multiple cell lines including HEK293 human kidney cells, 4T1 and 168FARN mouse mammary tumor cells with either ectopically or endogenously expressed Twist1. Tamoxifen-induced Twist1 degradation could be blocked by the MG132 proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that tamoxifen induces Twist1 degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. However, tamoxifen-induced Twist1 degradation was independent of Twist1 mRNA expression, estrogen signaling and MAPK-mediated Twist1 phosphorylation in these cells. Importantly, tamoxifen also significantly inhibited invasive behavior in Matrigel and lung metastasis in SCID-bg mice of ER-negative 4T1 mammary tumor cells, which depend on endogenous Twist1 to invade and metastasize. These results indicate that tamoxifen can significantly accelerate Twist1 degradation to suppress cancer cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that tamoxifen can be used not only to treat ER-positive breast cancers but also to reduce Twist1-mediated invasion and metastasis in ER-negative breast cancers.",

To study the role of p53 mutations in prostate cancer and to discriminate between the dominant-negative effect and the GOF activity of mutant p53, we measured, using microarrays, the expression profiles of three immortalized prostate epithelial cultures expressing wild-type, inactivated p53 or mutated p53. Analysis of these gene expression profiles showed that both inactivated p53 and p53(R175H) mutant expression resulted in the upregulation of cell cycle progression genes. A second group, which was upregulated exclusively by mutant p53(R175H), was predominantly enriched in developmental genes. This group of genes included the Twist1, a regulator of metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Twist1 levels were also elevated in metastatic prostate cancer-derived cell line DU145, in immortalized lung fibroblasts and in a subset of lung cancer samples, all in a mutant p53-dependent manner. p53(R175H) mutant bearing immortalized epithelial cells showed typical features of EMT, such as higher expression of mesenchymal markers, lower expression of epithelial markers and enhanced invasive properties in vitro. The mechanism by which p53(R175H) mutant induces Twist1 expression involves alleviation of the epigenetic repression. Our data suggest that Twist1 expression might be upregulated following p53 mutation in cancer cells.",

Eight novel ADAMTS13 mutations are presented. Half of the total number of mutant ADAMTS13 alleles are amino acid substitutions. The disease-causing mutations are spread over the gene. The pathogenicity of the individual mutations is based upon their predicted effect on the ADAMTS13 protein and segregation in family members.

The pathological feature of TTP consists of disseminated microvascular platelet thrombi. We describe a case of TTP with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome. A 27-year-old woman developed TTP in her second trimester of pregnancy. She presented with classical symptoms of TTP with compatible renal biopsy findings. Although four articles of SLE criteria (1982 ARA) were fulfilled, three of them were considered to be derived from multiple thrombosis except for a positive antinuclear antibody. Positive antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody) with SLE-like findings suggested the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome rather than SLE. Although TTP has been described in patients with SLE and they can share common clinical and pathological features, the relationship between these two diseases is controversial. Many theories have been proposed to explain the nature and cause of intravascular platelet aggregation in TTP. But the pathogenesis of TTP is still unclear. This case suggests an important causal relationship between antiphospholipid antibodies and TTP during pregnancy.

This study is a retrospective review of all 12 children with TTP seen at New York Medical College- Westchester Medical Center during a period of 15 y from 1993 to 2008. There were 7 females and 5 males with acquired TTP, with a median age of 13 (range, 6-17); and no cases of congenital TTP. The classic pentad of TTP (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic symptoms, renal dysfunction and fever) was seen in only three patients. Nine had renal involvement; eight had neurologic symptoms; and four had fever. All 12 patients had thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated LDH. Nine had idiopathic TTP. Three patients had one of the following underlying disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disorder, and aplastic anemia (post-bone marrow transplant on cyclosporine). ADAMTS13 level was decreased in 7 of 8 patients studied. Eight of 10 patients achieved remission with plasmapheresis alone. Two needed additional treatment before achieving remission. Two had one or more relapses, requiring immunosupressive treatment with vincrisine, prednisone, or rituximab. The patient with aplastic anemia died of pulmonary hypertension 5 y after bone marrow transplantation. All other 11 patients are alive and free of TTP for a median follow-up of 12 mo (range, 3-72 mo). Acquired pediatric TTP responds well to plasmapheresis. However, many patients do require additional treatment because of refractoriness to plasmapheresis or relapse. The clinical features, response to treatment, and relapse rate of pediatric TTP appear similar to those of adult TTP.",

It is used in an increasing number of cases of cerebrovascular disease, unstable angina, coronary artery stenting, and peripheral vascular diseases. It has rare but serious adverse reactions, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). TTP is a life-threatening disease, characterized by Moschcowitz's pentad: thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fluctuating neurological signs, renal failure, and fever. Recent advances in elucidating the proteolytic processing of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers have established assays for VWF-cleaving protease (VWF-CP) activity and its inhibitor(autoantibodies). These assays apparently demonstrated that TTP patients have defective enzymatic activity with or without presence of the inhibitor. VWF-CP is now identified as a metalloproteinase belonging to the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase domain, with ThromboSpondin type 1 motif) family, termed ADAMTS13. Cases of ticlopidine-associated TTP were first reported in 1991. This complication occurs in 1 in 1600 to 1 in 5000 patients who receive ticlopidine. It is known that they develop TTP within 2 to 8 wk of starting ticlopidine treatment and show severely deficient of ADAMTS13 activity with the presence of the inhibitor. These results suggest that ticlopidine or its metabolites induce the production of autoantibodies against ADAMTS13. As treatment, discontinuation of ticlopidine therapy and rapid initiation of plasma exchange is effective: the majority of patients completely recover and relapse is uncommon. It is thus recommended that physicians should perform complete blood count every 2 weeks for 12 weeks for rapid diagnosis. Physicians and patients should be aware of this fatal but curable complication of ticlopidine therapy.",

Prompt intervention with plasma exchange minimizes mortality and is the cornerstone of therapy. Rare reports have described \"pseudo-TTP\" driven by extreme hematologic abnormalities resulting from deficiency of vitamin B12. Distinguishing between these entities can pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A 77 year old female presented with altered mental status, renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, suggesting TTP. Workup demonstrated macrocytosis and reticulocytopenia, and B12 level was unmeasurably low. Other elements of her clinical presentation, including volume loss and bleeding suggested a multifactorial pathogenesis could be contributing to her laboratory abnormalities, reducing the likelihood that she had TTP. The risks and benefits of treating aggressively with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for TTP were considered given the diagnostic possibilities. The patient received TPE initially, with rapid de-escalation after her clinical response suggested \"pseudo-TTP\" from B12 deficiency was the driving the process. B12 supplementation corrected her hematologic abnormalities and she remains well two years after presenting. TTP is a rare condition with fatal consequences if left untreated. Guidelines recommend TPE even if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis of TTP. B12 deficiency is common, though not typically associated with severe hematologic abnormalities. We compare the presenting characteristics of all thirteen cases of pseudo-TTP reported in the literature with those from patients in case series of TTP to suggest a set of parameters that can help clinicians distinguish between pseudo-TTP and TTP and guide decision making regarding intervention. Evaluation of all TTP cases should include a B12, methylmalonic acid level and reticulocyte count. Reticulocytopenia suggests B12 deficiency. Finally an LDH level above 2500 IU/L is relatively uncommon in TTP and should suggest consideration of B12 deficiency.",

The histological hallmark is the presence of platelet thrombi occluding the microcirculation of multiple organs. The etiology and pathogenesis of disseminated platelet aggregation are uncertain and obviously not uniform in individual patients. Experimental findings suggest that microthrombi may result from intravascular platelet activation or form secondarily at sites of vessel wall damage. The differential diagnosis of TTP includes the hemolytic uremic syndrome in which the microangiopathic changes are exclusively found in the kidneys. When untreated, TTP invariably runs a progressive and fatal course.

There are still strong limitations to address, including the absence of vascularization which makes it difficult to feed the central layers of the organoid. Nevertheless, some important features of the nervous system have recently been observed in cerebral organoids: they manifest electrical activity (i.e. communication between neurons), are sensitive to light stimulation and are able to connect to a spinal cord by sending impulses that make a muscle contract. Recent data show that cortical organoid network development at ten months resembles some preterm babies EEG patterns. Although cerebral organoids are not close to human brains so far due to their extremely simplified structure, this state of things gives rise to ethical concerns about the creation and destructive experimental use of human cerebral organoids.

In this article, I discuss the conditions under which HCOs could be granted their own moral status. For this purpose, I consider the hypothesis that HCOs might develop a primitive form of consciousness and investigate the ways in which it could be detected.

In contrast to mammals, the differentiation potential of available insect cell lines is limited and can not be exploited for in vitro permeability assays to measure the uptake of insecticides. The successful development of in vitro models could be a result of the emergence of molecular mechanisms of self-organization and signaling in the intestine that are unique to mammals. It is nevertheless considered that the technology gap is a consequence of vast differences in knowledge, particularly with respect to culture conditions that maintain the differentation potential of insect midgut cells.

The term \"botulism\" was derived from the Latin word botulus, indicating its original association with sausages. It took another 150 years or so to come into clinical use. The first clinical application was strabismus, and was developed by the American ophthalmologist Alan B. Scott, whose effort led to the pharmaceutical product known as onabotulinumtoxinA today. The therapeutic benefit in migraine was an incidental finding in a report by the American plastic surgeon William J. Binder, which inspired a series of clinical studies in headache disorders. The doses and injection techniques in the earlier reports were variable, so were the results. It was until the Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) 1 and 2 studies when its efficacy and safety, as well as the indication, i.e., chronic migraine (CM), were ascertained. Even though there were criticisms regarding the heterogeneities in the results between the PREEMPT 1 and 2 studies, the data on efficacy endpoints and safety were generally consistent, which were subsequently confirmed by the open-label extension of the PREEMPT 1 and 2 studies, and three open-label studies, namely the Chronic Migraine OnabotulinuMtoxinA Prolonged Efficacy open Label (COMPEL), the REal-life use of botulinum toxin for the symptomatic treatment of adults with chronic migraine, measuring healthcare resource utilization, and Patient-reported OutcomeS observed in practice (REPOSE) studies, and the CM Post-Authorization Safety Study (CM PASS) studies. On the other hand, the results were challenged by the Chronification and Reversibility of Migraine (CHARM) study, which involved CM patients with medication overuse. It was concluded that the clinical improvement was attributed to early withdrawal of the overused acute medications, rather than onabotulinumtoxinA injections. However, fundamental differences in the patient profile and methodology between the CHARM and PREEMPT studies existed, and cautious should be exercised when interpreting and comparing the results. According to the practical guidelines and reimbursement regulations in many countries, its use is limited to CM patients, and is reserved for those who fail at least 2-3 preventive medications, due to either lack of efficacy or intolerability.

Although botulinum toxin A is available by prescription for cosmetic and therapeutic use, no cases of botulism with detectable serum toxin have previously been attributed to cosmetic or therapeutic botulinum toxin injections. On November 27, 2004, 4 suspected botulism case-patients with a link to cosmetic botulinum toxin injections were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To investigate the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory aspects of 4 suspected cases of iatrogenic botulism. Case series on 4 botulism case-patients. Clinical characteristics of the 4 case-patients, epidemiological associations, and mouse bioassay neutralization test results from case-patient specimens and a toxin sample. Clinical characteristics of the 4 case-patients were consistent with those of naturally occurring botulism. All case-patients had been injected with a highly concentrated, unlicensed preparation of botulinum toxin A and may have received doses 2857 times the estimated human lethal dose by injection. Pretreatment serum toxin levels in 3 of the 4 case-patients were equivalent to 21 to 43 times the estimated human lethal dose; pretreatment serum from the fourth epidemiologically linked case-patient was not available. A 100-microg vial of toxin taken from the same manufacturer's lot as toxin administered to the case-patients contained a toxin amount sufficient to kill approximately 14,286 adults by injection if disseminated evenly. These laboratory-confirmed cases of botulism demonstrate that clinical use of unlicensed botulinum toxin A can result in severe, life-threatening illness. Further education and regulation are needed to prevent the inappropriate marketing, sale, and clinical use of unlicensed botulinum toxin products.",

Botulism, a medical emergency, frequently presents with ocular findings including blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis, and photophobia as a result of the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. However, botulinum toxins also have therapeutic uses for medical conditions including strabismus. The safety and efficacy of Botulinum toxin A in patients with a history of botulism has not been reported. We report a 9-week-old infant, diagnosed with type B toxin positive infant botulism treated with human botulism immune globulin, who developed a large angle exotropia. The infant was treated with intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin A to the extraocular muscles resulting in a favorable initial response but ultimately required strabismus surgery. Clinical manifestations and management of botulism are reviewed and botulinum toxin in the treatment of pediatric strabismus is discussed.

Botulinum toxin has been of concern to the US military and its allies as a biowarfare weapon since World War II and, in more recent times, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a potential bioterrorist threat to the public. The most effective means of defending against the toxin is by inducing a protective immune response through vaccination. Vaccination with an appropriate antigen will produce neutralizing antibodies that will bind to and clear toxin from the circulation before it can enter nerve cells and block neurotransmission. Immunity from botulism, however, has the disadvantage of precluding an individual from realizing the potential benefits of therapeutic botulinum toxin, if such a need were to arise. Botulinum toxin has been used in the treatment of numerous neuromuscular, autonomic, and sensory disorders since it was first approved for the management of strabismus and blepharospasm by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Notwithstanding the value of the neurotoxin as a therapeutic drug, vaccines have been and will continue to be an important line of defense for those who work with the toxin (at-risk workers) and a select population of the military, law enforcement, and first responders. The first vaccine used to protect against botulinum neurotoxin was a chemically detoxified extract from Clostridium botulinum. A Pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) vaccine in service today is administered under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application held by the CDC. Recombinant subunit vaccines are in development and a bivalent H(c) vaccine (rBV A/B (Pichia pastoris)) is presently being evaluated in a phase II clinical trial.

Since its discovery by Justinus Kerner, BoNT has seen use in a wide range of cosmetic and non-cosmetic conditions such as cervical dystonia, cerebral palsy, migraines and hyperhidrosis. We tried to trace its history from its inception to its recent urological applications. Historical articles about botulinum toxin were reviewed and a Medline search was performed for its urological utility. We hereby present a brief review of historical aspects of BoNT and its applications in urology. In 1793, the first known outbreak of botulism occurred due to 'spoiled' sausage in Wildebad, Germany. The German physician and poet Justinus Kerner published the first accurate description of the clinical symptoms of botulism (sausage poison). He was also the first to mention its potential therapeutic applications. In urology, BoNT has been used in bladder and urethral lesions with varying degree of success. Recently, BoNT applications were explained for prostatic disorders. BoNT applications in urology are in the treatment of detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia, detrusor overactivity, detrusor underactivity, spastic conditions of the urethral sphincter, chronic prostate pain, interstitial cystitis, non-fibrotic bladder outflow obstruction (including benign prostatic hyperplasia) and acute urinary retention in women. Justinus Kerner is the godfather of botulism research. The role of BoNT in urology has evolved exponentially and it is widely used as an adjuvant in voiding dysfunction. In the future, its utility will broaden and guide the urologist in managing various urological disorders.",

However, the first incident of food-borne botulism was documented as late as the 18th century, when the consumption of meat and blood sausages gave rise to many deaths throughout the kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in South Western Germany. The district medical officer Justinus Kerner (1786--1862), who was also a well-known German poet, published the first accurate and complete descriptions of the symptoms of food-borne botulism between 1817 and 1822 and attributed the intoxication to a biological poison. Kerner also postulated that the toxin might be used for treatment purposes. In 1895, an outbreak of botulism in the small Belgian village of Ellezelles led to the discovery of the pathogen \"Clostridium botulinum\" by Emile Pierre van Ermengem. Modern botulinum toxin treatment was pioneered by Alan B. Scott and Edward J. Schantz in the early 1970s, when the type-A serotype was used in medicine to correct strabismus. Other preparations of the type-A toxin were developed and manufactured in the United Kingdom, Germany, and China, whereas a therapeutic type-B toxin was prepared in the United States. To date, the toxin has been used to treat a wide variety of conditions associated with muscular hyperactivity, glandular hypersecretions and pain.",

Here, we found that telomeric RNA (TERRA or TelRNA), one type of lncRNAs, is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) but declines significantly upon differentiation. TERRA is induced by the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and can reproduce its self-renewal-promoting effect when overexpressed. Further studies revealed that T cell factor 3 ( TCF3) is a potential downstream target of TERRA and mediates the effect of TERRA in mESC maintenance. TERRA inhibits TCF3 transcription, while enforced TCF3 expression abrogates the undifferentiated state of mESCs supported by TERRA. Accordingly, the transcripts of the pluripotency genes Esrrb, Tfcp2l1, and Klf2, repressed by TCF3 in mESCs, are increased in TERRA-overexpressing cells. Our study therefore highlights the important role of TERRA in mESC maintenance and also uncovers a mechanism by which TERRA promotes self-renewal. These data will expand our understanding of the pluripotent regulatory network of ESCs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30115631": "Alternative splicing (AS) plays important roles in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. In this study, we first identified transcripts that display specific AS patterns in pluripotent human ESCs (hESCs) relative to differentiated cells. One of these encodes T-cell factor 3 (TCF3), a transcription factor that plays important roles in ESC differentiation. AS creates two TCF3 isoforms, E12 and E47, and we identified two related splicing factors, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) H1 and F (hnRNP H/F), that regulate TCF3 splicing. We found that hnRNP H/F levels are high in hESCs, leading to high E12 expression, but decrease during differentiation, switching splicing to produce elevated E47 levels. Importantly, hnRNP H/F knockdown not only recapitulated the switch in TCF3 AS but also destabilized hESC colonies and induced differentiation. Providing an explanation for this, we show that expression of known TCF3 target E-cadherin, critical for maintaining ESC pluripotency, is repressed by E47 but not by E12.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347094": "Embryonic stem (ES) cells have a unique regulatory circuitry, largely controlled by the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, which generates a gene expression program necessary for pluripotency and self-renewal. How external signals connect to this regulatory circuitry to influence ES cell fate is not known. We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog. Thus, Tcf3 is an integral component of the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells, which includes an autoregulatory loop involving the pluripotency regulators. Both Tcf3 depletion and Wnt pathway activation cause increased expression of Oct4, Nanog, and other pluripotency factors and produce ES cells that are refractory to differentiation. Our results suggest that the Wnt pathway, through Tcf3, brings developmental signals directly to the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells to influence the balance between pluripotency and differentiation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21685889": "Self-renewal of rodent embryonic stem cells is enhanced by partial inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3; refs 1, 2). This effect has variously been attributed to stimulation of Wnt signalling by \u03b2-catenin, stabilization of Myc protein and global de-inhibition of anabolic processes. Here we demonstrate that \u03b2-catenin is not necessary for embryonic stem cell identity or expansion, but its absence eliminates the self-renewal response to Gsk3 inhibition. Responsiveness is fully restored by truncated \u03b2-catenin lacking the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain. However, requirement for Gsk3 inhibition is dictated by expression of T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) and mediated by direct interaction with \u03b2-catenin. Tcf3 localizes to many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells. Our findings confirm that Tcf3 acts as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that \u03b2-catenin directly abrogates Tcf3 function. We conclude that Gsk3 inhibition stabilizes the embryonic stem cell state primarily by reducing repressive influence on the core pluripotency network.",

We analyzed the intersection between genome localization and transcriptome data sets to identify genes repressed by Tcf3. Among these, manipulations of Esrrb gave distinctive phenotypes in functional assays. Knockdown and knockout eliminated response to Gsk3 inhibition, causing extinction of pluripotency markers and loss of colony forming capability. Conversely, forced expression phenocopied Gsk3 inhibition or Tcf3 deletion by suppressing differentiation and sustaining self-renewal. Thus the nuclear receptor Esrrb is necessary and sufficient to mediate self-renewal downstream of Gsk3 inhibition. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) regulates ESCs through Stat3, independently of Gsk3 inhibition. Consistent with parallel operation, ESCs in LIF accommodated Esrrb deletion and remained pluripotent. These findings highlight a key role for Esrrb in regulating the naive pluripotent state and illustrate compensation among the core pluripotency factors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23658527": "Canonical Wnt signaling plays a rate-limiting role in regulating self-renewal and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We have previously shown that mutation in the Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor gene constitutively activates Wnt signaling in ESCs and inhibits their capacity to differentiate towards ecto-, meso-, and endodermal lineages. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms through which Wnt regulates lineage differentiation in mouse ESCs remain to date largely unknown. To this aim, we have derived and studied the gene expression profiles of several Apc-mutant ESC lines encoding for different levels of Wnt signaling activation. We found that down-regulation of Tcf3, a member of the Tcf/Lef family and a key player in the control of self-renewal and pluripotency, represents a specific and primary response to Wnt activation in ESCs. Accordingly, rescuing Tcf3 expression partially restored the neural defects observed in Apc-mutant ESCs, suggesting that Tcf3 down-regulation is a necessary step towards Wnt-mediated suppression of neural differentiation. We found that Tcf3 down-regulation in the context of constitutively active Wnt signaling does not result from promoter DNA methylation but is likely to be caused by a plethora of mechanisms at both the RNA and protein level as shown by the observed decrease in activating histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3-acetylation) and the upregulation of miR-211, a novel Wnt-regulated microRNA that targets Tcf3 and attenuates early neural differentiation in mouse ESCs. Our data show for the first time that Wnt signaling down-regulates Tcf3 expression, possibly at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and thus highlight a novel mechanism through which Wnt signaling inhibits neuro-ectodermal lineage differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.",

However, how CSCs maintain <i>Nanog</i> gene expression has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that microRNA-449a (miR-449a) is overexpressed in poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, drug-resistant liver cancer cells, cultured liver tumorspheres, and Nanog-positive liver cancer cells. The upregulation of miR-449a in non-CSCs increased stemness, whereas the downregulation of miR-449a in Nanog-positive CSCs reduced stemness. Furthermore, transcription factor 3 (TCF3), a target of miR-449a, could downregulate <i>Nanog</i> expression, and restoring TCF3 expression in miR-449a-expressing Nanog-negative cells abrogated cellular stemness. These data establish that the miR449a-TCF3-Nanog axis maintains stemness in liver CSCs.",

Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs. Knockdown or knockout of <i>Lef1</i> partially mimics the self-renewal-promoting effect of MEK inhibitors. Moreover, depletion of both <i>Tcf3</i> and <i>Lef1</i> enables maintenance of undifferentiated mouse ESCs without exogenous factors, cytokines or inhibitors. Transcriptome resequencing analysis reveals that LEF1 is closely associated with endoderm specification in ESCs. Thus, our study adds support to the notion that the key to maintaining the ESC ground state is to shield ESCs from differentiative cues.",

At the time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed between blood and plasma concentrations from concurrently collected samples in a phase 1 (healthy subjects) and phase 2 (target patient population) study using graphical and population PK approaches. This integrated information was presented to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory input. Following regulatory concurrence, DBS was poised for use in further clinical studies. Population PK modeling was used to dissect sources of variability contributing to DBS collection in the outpatient setting.

The co-primary endpoints were pain freedom and headache response at two hours. The first primary hypothesis tested the dose-response trend for two-hour pain freedom using a logistic regression model. Subsequent hypotheses tested the effects of each dose on the co-primary endpoints, using a closed sequential testing procedure to control for multiplicity. A total of 527 participants received ubrogepant and 113 received placebo. A positive response trend in the proportion of participants achieving two-hour pain freedom was demonstrated (p &lt; 0.001).

Although AQP4-IgG are linked to NMOSD, MOG-IgG-associated diseases (MOGAD) include a broader clinical spectrum of autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Details of membrane assembly of AQP4-IgG required for complement activation have been uncovered. Affinity-purified MOG-IgG from patients were shown to be pathogenic by induction of demyelination when the blood--brain barrier (BBB) was breached and by enhancement of activation of cognate T cells. A high-affinity AQP4-IgG, given peripherally, could induce NMOSD-like lesions in rats in the absence of BBB breach. Circulating AQP4-specific and MOG-specific B cells were identified and suggest differences in origin of MOG-antibodies or AQP4-antibodies.

How do we sequence NMO therapies with the understanding of the acuteness and severity of the disease, the individual mechanism of action (MOA) and rapidity of onset of action, onset of efficacy and long-term safety of each agent? We might suggest the following sequence - 1st line using eculizumab for rapid efficacy and stabilization without effect on the acquired immune system followed by satrilizumab (long term immunomodulation). Reserve inebilizumab (immunosuppressant) for breakthrough disease and salvage the severe with AHSCBMT. In NMO, control the complement, transition to modulation, and reserve suppression - and salvage the severe with AHSCBMT.",

Interleukin-6 is involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Satralizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor. The efficacy of satralizumab added to immunosuppressant treatment in patients with NMOSD is unclear. In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with NMOSD who were seropositive or seronegative for AQP4-IgG to receive either satralizumab, at a dose of 120 mg, or placebo, administered subcutaneously at weeks 0, 2, and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter, added to stable immunosuppressant treatment. The primary end point was the first protocol-defined relapse in a time-to-event analysis. Key secondary end points were the change from baseline to week 24 in the visual-analogue scale (VAS) pain score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pain) and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score (range, 0 to 52, with lower scores indicating more fatigue). Safety was also assessed. A total of 83 patients were enrolled, with 41 assigned to the satralizumab group and 42 to the placebo group. The median treatment duration with satralizumab in the double-blind period was 107.4 weeks. Relapse occurred in 8 patients (20%) receiving satralizumab and in 18 (43%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16 to 0.88). Multiple imputation for censored data resulted in hazard ratios ranging from 0.34 to 0.44 (with corresponding P values of 0.01 to 0.04). Among 55 AQP4-IgG-seropositive patients, relapse occurred in 11% of those in the satralizumab group and in 43% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.75); among 28 AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients, relapse occurred in 36% and 43%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.20 to 2.24). The between-group difference in the change in the mean VAS pain score was 4.08 (95% CI, -8.44 to 16.61); the between-group difference in the change in the mean FACIT-F score was -3.10 (95% CI, -8.38 to 2.18). The rates of serious adverse events and infections did not differ between groups.

In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, we enrolled adults aged 18-74 years with aquaporin-4 antibody seropositive or seronegative NMOSD at 44 investigational sites in 13 countries. Eligible participants had experienced at least one documented NMOSD attack or relapse in the past 12 months and had a score of 6\u00b75 or less on the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Exclusion criteria included clinical relapse 30 days or fewer before baseline. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive satralizumab 120 mg or visually matched placebo subcutaneously at weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Taking immunosuppressants concomitantly was prohibited. The primary endpoint was time to the first protocol-defined relapse, based on the intention-to-treat population and analysed with stratification for two randomisation factors (previous therapy for prevention of attacks and nature of the most recent attack). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of satralizumab or placebo. The double-blind phase was due to last until 44 protocol-defined relapses occurred or 1\u00b75 years after random assignment of the last patient enrolled, whichever occurred first; participants could enter an open-label phase after the occurrence of a protocol-defined relapse or at the end of the double-blind phase.

Although the prevalence of NMO is low, the rapid and severe impairment observed in patients has led to extensive development of research in the fields of diagnostic criteria and therapy in the past 15 years. With improved understanding of the pathophysiology of NMO and the role of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies, numerous therapeutic approaches have been proposed and are currently undergoing evaluation.

The pathological mechanism underlying hepatolithiasis is closely related to bacterial infections of the intrahepatic bile duct, followed by chronic inflammation and the overexpression of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC). However, the exact mechanism responsible for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2011induced upregulation of MUC5AC has yet to be elucidated. Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that plays a vital role in the regulation of a number of genes that are responsible for normal cellular function. microRNA (miR/miRNA)\u2011130b is a member of the miRNA family. miRNAs can bind to the 3'\u2011untralsated region (3'\u2011UTR) of a target gene and influence its expression levels. The present study found that LPS increases the expression of MUC5AC by influencing Sp1 secretion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation\u2011quantitative PCR experiments further verified three Sp1 binding sites in the MUC5AC promoter sequence that can regulate the expression of MUC5AC. Further analysis demonstrated that Sp1 expression was regulated by miR\u2011130b.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31729101": "MUC1 is a membrane glycoprotein, which in adenocarninomas is overexpressed and exhibits truncated O-glycosylation. Overexpression and altered glycosylation make MUC1 into a candidate for immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies directed against MUC1 frequently bind an immunodominant epitope that contains a single site for O-glycosylation. Glycosylation with tumor carbohydrate antigens such as the Tn-antigen (GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) results in antibodies binding with higher affinity. One proposed model to explain the enhanced affinity of antibodies for the glycosylated antigen is that the addition of a carbohydrate alters the conformational properties, favoring a binding-competent state. The conformational effects associated with Tn glycosylation of the MUC1 antigen was investigated using solution-state NMR and molecular dynamics. NMR experiments revealed distinct substructures of the glycosylated MUC1 peptides compared with the unglycosylated peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations of the MUC1 glycopeptide and peptide revealed distinguishing differences in their conformational preferences. Furthermore, the glycopeptide displayed a smaller conformational sampling compared with the peptide, suggesting that the glycopeptide sampled a narrower conformational space and is less dynamic. A comparison of the computed ensemble of conformations assuming random distribution, NMR models, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the MUC1 glycopeptide and aglycosylated peptide sampled structurally distinctly ensembles and that these ensembles were different from that of the random coil. Together, these data support the hypothesis that that conformational pre-selection could be an essential feature of these peptides that dictates the binding affinities to MUC1 specific antibodies.",

However, the clinicopathological and biological significance of MUC13 in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to define the role of MUC13 in the progression of iCCA. Expression levels of MUC13 in human iCCA samples were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and real-time PCR. In vitro and in vivo experiments were used to assess the effect of MUC13 on iCCA cell growth and metastasis. Crosstalk between MUC13 and EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling was analyzed by molecular methods. The upstream regulatory effects of MUC13 were evaluated by Luciferase and DNA methylation assays. MUC13 was overexpressed in human iCCA specimens and iCCA cells. MUC13 overexpression positively correlated with clinicopathological characteristics of iCCA, such as vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis, and was independently associated with poor survival. Results from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments suggested that knockdown of MUC13 attenuated, while overexpression of MUC13 enhanced, the proliferation, motility, and invasiveness of iCCA cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT signal pathway and its downstream effectors, such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9, were required for MUC13-mediated tumor metastasis of iCCA. MUC13 interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequently activated the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by promoting EGFR dimerization and preventing EGFR internalization. We also found that MUC13 was directly regulated by miR-212-3p, whose downregulation was related to aberrant CpG hypermethylation in the promoter area. These findings suggest that aberrant hypermethylation-induced downregulation of miR-212-3p results in overexpression of MUC13 in iCCA, leading to metastasis via activation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Mucin 13 overexpression has been implicated in the development of malignancies, although its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has not been studied. Herein, we show that mucin 13 plays a critical role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Mucin 13 could have therapeutic value both as a prognostic marker and as a treatment target.",

Inflammation causes MUC1 overexpression and hypoglycosylation. We hypothesized that overexpression of hypoglycosylated MUC1 would be found in postoperative Crohn's disease (CD) recurrence and could be considered an additional biomarker of recurrence severity. We examined archived neo-terminal ileum biopsies from patients with prior ileocecal resection who had postoperative endoscopic assessment of CD recurrence and given a Rutgeerts ileal recurrence score. Consecutive tissue sections were stained using 2 different anti-MUC1 antibodies, HMPV that recognizes all forms of MUC1 and 4H5 that recognizes only inflammation-associated hypoglycosylated MUC1. A total of 71 postoperative CD patients were evaluated. There was significant increase in MUC1 expression of both glycosylated/normal (P&lt;0.0001) and hypoglycosylated/abnormal (P&lt;0.0001) forms in patients with severe endoscopic CD recurrence (i3+i4), ileal score i2, compared with patients in endoscopic remission (i0+i1). Results were similar regardless of anti-TNF-\u03b1 use. Although MUC1 expression and Rutgeerts scores were in agreement when characterizing the majority of cases, there were a few exceptions where MUC1 expression was characteristic of more severe recurrence than implied by Rutgeerts score. MUC1 is overexpressed and hypoglycosylated in neo-terminal ileum tissue of patients with postoperative CD recurrence. Increased levels are associated with more severe endoscopic recurrence scores, and this is not influenced by anti-TNF-\u03b1 use. Discrepancies found between Rutgeerts scores and MUC1 expression suggest that addition of MUC1 as a biomarker of severity of postoperative CD recurrence may improve categorization of recurrence status and consequently treatment decisions.",

We show that the Smc2-Smc4 coiled coils are highly flexible polymers with a persistence length of only \u223c 4 nm.

The assembly of DNA into chromatin provides the substrate for topoisomerases and condensins, which introduce the different levels of superhelical torsion required for DNA metabolism. In particular, Top2 and condensin are directly involved in both the resolution of precatenanes that form during replication and the formation of the intramolecular loop that detects tension at the centromeric chromatin during chromosome biorientation. Here we show that histone depletion activates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and impairs sister chromatid decatenation, leading to chromosome mis-segregation and lethality in the absence of the SAC. We demonstrate that histone depletion impairs chromosome biorientation and activates the Aurora-dependent pathway, which detects tension problems at the kinetochore. Interestingly, SAC activation is suppressed by the absence of Top2 and Smc2, an essential component of condensin. Indeed, smc2-8 suppresses catenanes accumulation, mitotic arrest and growth defects induced by histone depletion at semi-permissive temperature. Remarkably, SAC activation by histone depletion is associated with condensin-mediated alterations of the centromeric chromatin. Therefore, our results reveal the importance of a precise interplay between histone supply and condensin/Top2 for pericentric chromatin structure, precatenanes resolution and centromere biorientation.",

Smc2p and Smc4p form a stable heterodimer, the \"Smc2/4 complex,\" which upon analysis by sedimentation equilibrium appears to reversibly self-associate to form heterotetramers. Individually, neither Smc2p nor Smc4p hydrolyzes ATP; however, ATPase activity is recovered by equal molar mixing of both purified proteins. Hydrolysis activity is unaffected by the presence of DNA. Smc2/4 binds both linearized and circular plasmids, and the binding appears to be independent of adenylate nucleotide. High mole ratios of Smc2/4 to plasmid promote a geometric change in circular DNA that can be trapped as knots by type II topoisomerases but not as supercoils by a type I topoisomerase. Binding titration analyses reveal that two Smc2/4-DNA-bound states exist, one disrupted by and one resistant to salt challenge. Competition-displacement experiments show that Smc2/4-DNA-bound species formed at even high protein to DNA mole ratios remain reversible. Surprisingly, only linear and supercoiled DNA, not nicked-circular DNA, can completely displace Smc2/4 prebound to a labeled, nicked-circular DNA. To explain this geometry-dependent competition, we present two models of DNA binding by SMCs in which two DNA duplexes are captured within the inter-coil space of an Smc2/4 heterodimer. Based on these models, we propose a DNA displacement mechanism to explain how differences in geometry could affect the competitive potential of DNA.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16100111": "Smc2/4 forms the core of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae condensin, which promotes metaphase chromosome compaction. To understand how condensin manipulates DNA, we used two in vitro assays to study the role of SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) proteins and ATP in reconfiguring the path of DNA. The first assay evaluated the topology of knots formed in the presence of topoisomerase II. Unexpectedly, both wild-type Smc2/4 and an ATPase mutant promoted (+) chiral knotting of nicked plasmids, revealing that ATP hydrolysis and the non-SMC condensins are not required to compact DNA chirally. The second assay measured Smc2/4-dependent changes in linking number (Lk). Smc2/4 did not induce (+) supercoiling, but instead induced broadening of topoisomer distributions in a cooperative manner without altering Lk(0). To explain chiral knotting in substrates devoid of chiral supercoiling, we propose that Smc2/4 directs chiral DNA compaction by constraining the duplex to retrace its own path. In this highly cooperative process, both (+) and (-) loops are sequestered (about one per kb), leaving net writhe and twist unchanged while broadening Lk. We have developed a quantitative theory to account for these results. Additionally, we have shown at higher molar stoichiometries that Smc2/4 prevents relaxation by topoisomerase I and nick closure by DNA ligase, indicating that Smc2/4 can saturate DNA. By electron microscopy of Smc2/4-DNA complexes, we observed primarily two protein-laden bound species: long flexible filaments and uniform rings or \"doughnuts.\" Close packing of Smc2/4 on DNA explains the substrate protection we observed. Our results support the hypothesis that SMC proteins bind multiple DNA duplexes.",

All genes are essential for cell viability and encode proteins that form a complex in vivo. We characterized new mutant alleles of the genes encoding the core subunits of this complex, smc2-8 and smc4-1. Both SMC2 and SMC4 are essential for chromosome transmission in anaphase. Mutations in these genes cause defects in establishing condensation of unique (chromosome VIII arm) and repetitive (rDNA) regions of the genome but do not impair sister chromatid cohesion. In vivo localization of Smc4p fused to green fluorescent protein showed that, unexpectedly, in S. cerevisiae the condensin complex concentrates in the rDNA region at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. rDNA segregation in mitosis is delayed and/or stalled in smc2 and smc4 mutants, compared with separation of pericentromeric and distal arm regions. Mitotic transmission of chromosome III carrying the rDNA translocation is impaired in smc2 and smc4 mutants. Thus, the condensin complex in S. cerevisiae has a specialized function in mitotic segregation of the rDNA locus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that condensin is physically associated with rDNA in vivo. Thus, the rDNA array is the first identified set of DNA sequences specifically bound by condensin in vivo. The biological role of higher-order chromosome structure in S. cerevisiae is discussed.",

These proteins have been studied extensively in yeast and animal systems, where they modulate chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and dosage compensation. Arabidopsis contains single copies of SMC1 and SMC3 cohesins. We used forward genetics to identify duplicate T-DNA insertions in each gene. These mutants (ttn7 and ttn8) have similar titan phenotypes: giant endosperm nuclei and arrested embryos with a few small cells. A single SMC2 knockout (ttn3) was identified and confirmed by molecular complementation. The weak embryo phenotype observed in this mutant may result from expression of a related gene (AtSMC2) with overlapping functions.

Here, we report that fission yeast has the same five-member condensin complex, each of which is essential for mitotic condensation. The condensin complex was purified and the subunits were identified by microsequencing. Cnd1, Cnd2, and Cnd3, three non-SMC subunits showing a high degree of sequence conservation to frog subunits, are essential for viability, and their gene disruption leads to a phenotype indistinguishable from that observed in cut3-477 and cut14-208, known mutations in SMC4 and SMC2-like subunits. Condensin subunits tagged with GFP were observed to alter dramatically their localization during the cell cycle, enriched in the nucleus during mitosis, but cytoplasmic during other stages. This stage-specific alteration in localization requires mitosis-specific phosphorylation of the T19 Cdc2 site in Cut3. The T19 site is phosphorylated in vitro by Cdc2 kinase and shows the maximal phosphorylation in metaphase in vivo. Its alanine substitution mutant fails to suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of cut3-477, and shows deficiency in condensation, probably because Cut3 T19A remains cytoplasmic.

We have cloned an Arabidopsis gene, AtCAP-E1, which is a functional ortholog of the yeast SMC2 gene. A second, highly homologous SMC2 gene, AtCAPE-2, was identified by the Arabidopsis genome project. SMC2 gene expression in Arabidopsis was correlated with the mitotic activity of tissues, with high level expression observed in meristematic cells. The two genes are differentially expressed with AtCAP-E1 accounting for more than 85% of the total SMC2 transcript pool. The titan3 mutant is the result of a T-DNA insertion into AtCAP-E1, but other than subtle endosperm defects, titan3 is viable and fecund. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant of AtCAP-E2, which showed no obvious mutant phenotype, indicating that the two genes are functionally redundant. Genetic crosses were employed to examine the consequences of reduced SMC2 levels. Both male and female gametogenesis were compromised in double mutant spores. Embryo lethality was observed for both double homozygous and AtCAP-E1(-/-), AtCAP-E2(+/-) plants; arrest occurred at or before the globular stage and was associated with altered planes of cell division in both the suspensor and the embryo. Down regulation of both genes by antisense technology, as well as in AtCAP-E1(+/-), AtCAP-E2(-/-) plants results in meristem disorganization and fasciation.

The Drosophila protein is required for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis, and Xenopus protein functions in mitotic chromosome condensation. Mutant brn1 cells show a defect in mitotic chromosome condensation and sister chromatid separation and segregation in anaphase. Chromatid cohesion before anaphase is properly maintained in the mutants. Some brn1 mutant cells apparently arrest in S-phase, pointing to a possible function for Brn1p at this stage of the cell cycle. Brn1p is a nuclear protein with a nonuniform distribution pattern, and its level is up-regulated at mitosis. Temperature-sensitive mutations of BRN1 can be suppressed by overexpression of a novel gene YCG1, which is homologous to another Xenopus condensin subunit, XCAP-G. Overexpression of SMC2, a gene necessary for chromosome condensation, and a homologue of the XCAP-E condensin, does not suppress brn1, pointing to functional specialization of components of the condensin complex.",

This development will change headache management fundamentally. We aim to summarize and compare the phase 2 data. The change from baseline in the number of migraine days at the end of treatment in high-frequency episodic migraine was -1 (at weeks 5-8), -1.1 (at weeks 9-12), -1.2 (at weeks 9-12) and -2.6 (at weeks 9-12) days for ALD403, AMG344, LY2951742 and TEV48125 (225 mg), respectively. Number needed to treats for responders and odds ratio for any adverse event were 4.7, 6.2, 4.0 and 4.0 and 1.09, 0.96, 1.07 and 1.05, respectively. All four CGRP antibodies display comparable efficacy that does not differ significantly from that of the currently available oral antimigraine drugs.

Despite strong evidence for heritability, genome-wide association studies have had little success in identification of risk loci associated with epilepsy, probably because of relatively small sample sizes and insufficient power. We aimed to identify risk loci through meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for all epilepsy and the two largest clinical subtypes (genetic generalised epilepsy and focal epilepsy). We combined genome-wide association data from 12 cohorts of individuals with epilepsy and controls from population-based datasets. Controls were ethnically matched with cases. We phenotyped individuals with epilepsy into categories of genetic generalised epilepsy, focal epilepsy, or unclassified epilepsy. After standardised filtering for quality control and imputation to account for different genotyping platforms across sites, investigators at each site conducted a linear mixed-model association analysis for each dataset. Combining summary statistics, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of all epilepsy, focal epilepsy, and genetic generalised epilepsy. We set the genome-wide significance threshold at p&lt;1\u00b766 \u00d7 10(-8). We included 8696 cases and 26 157 controls in our analysis. Meta-analysis of the all-epilepsy cohort identified loci at 2q24.3 (p=8\u00b771 \u00d7 10(-10)), implicating SCN1A, and at 4p15.1 (p=5\u00b744 \u00d7 10(-9)), harbouring PCDH7, which encodes a protocadherin molecule not previously implicated in epilepsy. For the cohort of genetic generalised epilepsy, we noted a single signal at 2p16.1 (p=9\u00b799 \u00d7 10(-9)), implicating VRK2 or FANCL. No single nucleotide polymorphism achieved genome-wide significance for focal epilepsy. This meta-analysis describes a new locus not previously implicated in epilepsy and provides further evidence about the genetic architecture of these disorders, with the ultimate aim of assisting in disease classification and prognosis. The data suggest that specific loci can act pleiotropically raising risk for epilepsy broadly, or can have effects limited to a specific epilepsy subtype. Future genetic analyses might benefit from both lumping (ie, grouping of epilepsy types together) or splitting (ie, analysis of specific clinical subtypes).

In this trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of nerinetide in human ischaemia-reperfusion that occurs with rapid endovascular thrombectomy in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke. For this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study done in 48 acute care hospitals in eight countries, we enrolled patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion within a 12 h treatment window. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with a disabling ischaemic stroke at the time of randomisation, had been functioning independently in the community before the stroke, had an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) greater than 4, and vascular imaging showing moderate-to-good collateral filling, as determined by multiphase CT angiography. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous nerinetide in a single dose of 2\u00b76 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 270 mg, on the basis of estimated or actual weight (if known) or saline placebo by use of a real-time, dynamic, internet-based, stratified randomised minimisation procedure. Patients were stratified by intravenous alteplase treatment and declared endovascular device choice. All trial personnel and patients were masked to sequence and treatment allocation. All patients underwent endovascular thrombectomy and received alteplase in usual care when indicated. The primary outcome was a favourable functional outcome 90 days after randomisation, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. Secondary outcomes were measures of neurological disability, functional independence in activities of daily living, excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and mortality. The analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ASPECTS, occlusion location, site, alteplase use, and declared first device.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11985619": "Two genes (CM-AAT1 and CM-AAT2) with strong sequence homology (87% identity at the protein level) putatively involved in the formation of aroma volatile esters have been isolated from Charentais melon fruit. They belong to a large and highly divergent family of multifunctional plant acyl-transferases and show at most 21% identity to the only other fruit acyl-transferase characterized so far in strawberry. RT-PCR studies indicated that both genes were specifically expressed in fruit at increasing rates in the early and mid phases of ripening. Expression was severely reduced in ethylene-suppressed antisense ACC oxidase (AS) fruit and in wild-type (WT) fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-MCP. Cloning of the two genes in yeast revealed that the CM-AAT1 protein exhibited alcohol acyl-transferase activity while no such activity could be detected for CM-AAT2 despite the strong homology between the two sequences. CM-AAT1 was capable of producing esters from a wide range of combinations of alcohols and acyl-CoAs. The higher the carbon chain of aliphatic alcohols, the higher the activity. Branched alcohols were esterified at differential rates depending on the position of the methyl group and the nature of the acyl donor. Phenyl and benzoyl alcohols were also good substrates, but activity varied with the position and size of the aromatic residue. The cis/trans configuration influenced activity either positively (2-hexenol) or negatively (3-hexenol). Because ripening melons evolve the whole range of esters generated by the recombinant CM-AAT1 protein, we conclude that CM-AAT1 plays a major role in aroma volatiles formation in the melon.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16247561": "Volatile esters, a major class of compounds contributing to the aroma of many fruit, are synthesized by alcohol acyl-transferases (AAT). We demonstrate here that, in Charentais melon (Cucumis melo var. cantalupensis), AAT are encoded by a gene family of at least four members with amino acid identity ranging from 84% (Cm-AAT1/Cm-AAT2) and 58% (Cm-AAT1/Cm-AAT3) to only 22% (Cm-AAT1/Cm-AAT4). All encoded proteins, except Cm-AAT2, were enzymatically active upon expression in yeast and show differential substrate preferences. Cm-AAT1 protein produces a wide range of short and long-chain acyl esters but has strong preference for the formation of E-2-hexenyl acetate and hexyl hexanoate. Cm-AAT3 also accepts a wide range of substrates but with very strong preference for producing benzyl acetate. Cm-AAT4 is almost exclusively devoted to the formation of acetates, with strong preference for cinnamoyl acetate. Site directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the failure of Cm-AAT2 to produce volatile esters is related to the presence of a 268-alanine residue instead of threonine as in all active AAT proteins. Mutating 268-A into 268-T of Cm-AAT2 restored enzyme activity, while mutating 268-T into 268-A abolished activity of Cm-AAT1. Activities of all three proteins measured with the prefered substrates sharply increase during fruit ripening. The expression of all Cm-AAT genes is up-regulated during ripening and inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene. The data presented in this work suggest that the multiplicity of AAT genes accounts for the great diversity of esters formed in melon.",

Phenotypic variability in ester production was investigated using a segregating population from a 'Royal Gala' (RG; high ester production) \u00d7 'Granny Smith' (GS; low ester production) cross, as well as in transgenic RG plants in which expression of the alcohol acyl transferase 1 (AAT1) gene was reduced. In the RG \u00d7 GS population, 46 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the production of esters and alcohols were identified on 15 linkage groups (LGs). The major QTL for 35 individual compounds was positioned on LG2 and co-located with AAT1. Multiple AAT1 gene variants were identified in RG and GS, but only two (AAT1-RGa and AAT1-GSa) were functional. AAT1-RGa and AAT1-GSa were both highly expressed in the cortex and skin of ripe fruit, but AAT1 protein was observed mainly in the skin. Transgenic RG specifically reduced in AAT1 expression showed reduced levels of most key esters in ripe fruit. Differences in the ripe fruit aroma could be perceived by sensory analysis. The transgenic lines also showed altered ratios of biosynthetic precursor alcohols and aldehydes, and expression of a number of ester biosynthetic genes increased, presumably in response to the increased substrate pool. These results indicate that the AAT1 locus is critical for the biosynthesis of esters contributing to a 'ripe apple' flavour.",

In this article, the various psychopathological and diagnostic hypothesis and the different criteria proposed by the various authors have been analysed and compared, paying attention also to the new studies conducted in Europe and to therapeutic perspectives that are opening up for its treatment. Numerous hypothesis have been put forward for the genesis of hikikomori, in particular, the hypothesis of a behaviour seen as a dysfuncion of the family system or as a result of our current modern society. Furthermore, this behaviour has been compared to other conditions such as internet addiction and a specific form of depression called Modern Type Depression (MTD). Hikikomori could represent the clinical answer to a social evolution, similarly to other phenomena such as binge behaviours and use of psychoactive substances. Further studies are needed to clarify diffusion, diagnosticassessment and differential diagnosis.Key pointsHikikomori is now considered a contemporary society-bound syndrome linked to modern society changes.Hikikomori might be a coping strategy to avoid relationships, social judgement and possible failures.Hikikomori might represent an extreme suffering that needs to be identified early: it is linked to severe form of modern type depression and it is a risk factor for suicidal behaviours.It is important to inform and sensitise communities about hikikomori to assure early interventions.More clinical studies are needed to define a unitary and specific model of hikikomori and to structure focussed interventions.",

The number of Hikikomori cases in Japan was estimated at about 563,000 in 2016 according to governmental surveys. However, no studies have reported how many people with Hikikomori have access to community-based psychiatry clinics, and how different they are from non-Hikikomori patients regarding their baseline characteristics and outcomes. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the baseline characteristics, clinical attendance, and social functioning of community psychiatric clinic patients treated for social withdrawal at one-year follow-up. Participants (n = 304) were all patients (aged under 65) of a psychiatric clinic in a one-year period. Baseline patient characteristics were compared among \"current\" Hikikomori patients, \"past\" Hikikomori,\" and \"other\" patients. Logistic regression analysis of clinic attendance status and social functioning at one-year follow-up was used to assess patient outcomes. Independent variables were age, gender, Hikikomori status, and support from clinical staff. Numbers of \"current\", \"past\" Hikikomori, and \"other\" patients were 60 (19.7%), 81 (26.6%), and 163 (53.6%), respectively. The percentage of \"current\" Hikikomori who attended in person (56.7%) was significantly smaller than for \"past\" (92.6%) and \"other\" (92.6) (p &lt; .001). The age distribution of \"current\" Hikikomori patients was bimodal, peaking at 20 and 40-45 years. The \"current\" state predicted significantly fewer regular visits (OR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.22-0.83; p = .012); support from psychiatric social workers increased visits (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.14-4.86; p = .021). Among the \"current\" Hikikomori patients, first visit attendance in person predicted regular attendance; no factor consistently predicted working/schooling status.

In Japan, novel expressive forms of psychiatric phenomena such as \"modern-type depression\" and \"hikikomori\" (a syndrome of severe social withdrawal lasting for at least six months) have been reported especially among young people. Economic games such as the trust game have been utilized to evaluate real-world interpersonal relationships as a novel candidate for psychiatric evaluations. To investigate the relationship between trusting behaviors and various psychometric scales, we conducted a trust game experiment with eighty-one Japanese university students as a pilot study. Participants made a risky financial decision about whether to trust each of 40 photographed partners. Participants then answered a set of questionnaires with seven scales including the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS)-6 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9. Consistent with previous research, male participants trusted partners more than female participants. Regression analysis revealed that LSNS-family (perceived support from family) for male participants, and item 8 of PHQ-9 (subjective agitation and/or retardation) for female participants were associated with participants' trusting behaviors. Consistent with claims by social scientists, our data suggest that, for males, support from family was negatively associated with cooperative behavior toward non-family members. Females with higher subjective agitation (and/or retardation) gave less money toward males and high attractive females, but not toward low attractive females in interpersonal relationships.

However, this universality idea has been critiqued because exploration is not as valued in Japanese culture as it is in Western cultures. Waters and Waters (2006) hypothesized that one's experiences of secure base behaviors are stored as a script in memory, and developed a narrative assessment called the Attachment Script Assessment (ASA) to evaluate one's secure base script. This study examined the validity of the ASA and the utility of secure base concept in Japanese culture. A sample of Japanese young adults (N = 89; M = 23.46; SD = 3.20; 57% = females) completed both the ASA and self-report questionnaires. The results revealed that the ASA score was associated with two dimensions of self-report questionnaires assessing parent-youth attachment relationships (trust and communication). The ASA score was not related to Japanese cultural values (amae acceptance, interdependent self-construal, and low independent self-construal). However, a low ASA score was related to a psychological dysfunction in the Japanese cultural context; hikikomori symptoms, which are defined as a desire to remain in his or her own room and his or her understanding of this behavior in other people. We concluded that since hikikomori can be interpreted as an extreme inhibition of exploration, the association between low secure base script and hikikomori symptoms suggests the utility of secure base construct in Japan.

Recently, we revealed that avoidant personality disorder is the most common comorbidity of hikikomori. Thus, we have postulated that avoidant personality is the personality underpinning hikikomori. First, we herein show relationships between avoidant personality traits, blood biomarkers, hikikomori-related psychological features, and behavioural characteristics assessed by a trust game in non-hikikomori volunteers. Avoidant personality traits were negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and uric acid (UA) in men, and positively associated with fibrin degeneration products (FDP) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in women. Next, we recruited actual individuals with hikikomori, and compared avoidant personality traits, blood biomarkers, and psychological features between individuals with hikikomori and age-matched healthy controls. Individuals with hikikomori had higher avoidant personality scores in both sexes, and showed lower serum UA levels in men and lower HDL-C levels in women compared with healthy controls. This is the first report showing possible blood biomarkers for hikikomori, and opens the door to clarify the underlying biological pathophysiology of hikikomori.",

What remains unclear is whether hikikomori is a culture-bound syndrome or a condition impacting youths around the globe. Hence, the self-reported prevalence and psychosocial correlates of past experiences with hikikomori were examined in cross-sectional samples of university students from Singapore (<i>n</i> = 147), Nigeria (<i>n</i> = 151), and the United States (<i>n</i> = 301). Following tests of measurement invariance, comparisons showed that past experiences with hikikomori were related to elevated levels of current loneliness and depressive symptoms in each sample. However, analyses also revealed evidence of cultural variation in both the prevalence and the psychosocial correlates associated with past experiences of hikikomori, which taken together, provide preliminary evidence that the culture-bound characterization of hikikomori may not be appropriate.",

We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. We mapped TWIST to human chromosome 7p21-p22 and mutational analysis reveals nonsense, missense, insertion and deletion mutations in patients. These mutations occur within the basic DNA binding, helix I and loop domains, or result in premature termination of the protein. Studies in Drosophila indicate that twist may affect the transcription of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), another gene family implicated in human craniosynostosis.

We identified three novel intragenic mutations and six deletions in our patients by using a new strategy to screen for TWIST mutations. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with subsequent sequencing to identify point mutations and small insertions or deletions in the coding region, and real-time PCR-based gene dosage analysis to identify large deletions encompassing the gene, with confirmation by microsatellite and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. The size of the deletions can also be analyzed by using the gene dosage assay with \"PCR walking\" across the critical region. In 55 patients with features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, 11% were detected to have deletions by real-time gene dosage analysis. Two patients had a translocation or inversion at least 260 kb 3' of the gene, suggesting they had position-effect mutations.

Indeed, mutant genotypes included frameshift deletions/insertions, nonsense and missense mutations, either truncating or disrupting the b-HLH motif of the protein. This observation gives additional support to the view that most ACS III cases result from loss-of-function mutations at the TWIST locus. The P250R recurrent FGFR 3 mutation was found in 2/22 cases presenting mild clinical manifestations of the disease but 4/22 cases failed to harbour TWIST or FGFR 3 mutations. Clinical re-examination of patients carrying TWIST mutations failed to reveal correlations between the mutant genotype and severity of the phenotype.

Here we report on the identification of a novel mutation affecting a highly conserved residue of the basic domain. Unlike nonsense and missense mutations lying within helices, this mutation does not affect protein stability or heterodimerisation of TWIST with its partner E12. However, it does abolish TWIST binding capacity to a target E-box as efficiently as two missense mutations in the loop-helix II junction. By contrast, elongation of the loop through a 7 amino acid insertion appears not to hamper binding to the DNA target. We conclude that loss of TWIST protein function in Saethre-Chotzen patients can occur at three different levels, namely protein stability, dimerisation, and DNA binding and that the loop-helix II junction is essential for effective protein-DNA interaction.",

Functional differences were even more important: intracranial hypertension as a consequence of early progressive multisutural fusion was a significant problem in SCS only, while mental delay and sensorineural hearing loss were associated with the Muenke's syndrome.

Although much of the genetics and phenotypes in craniosynostosis syndromes is understood, less is known about the underlying ossification mechanism during suture closure. We have previously demonstrated that physiological closure of the posterior frontal suture occurs through endochondral ossification. Moreover, we revealed that antagonizing canonical Wnt-signaling in the sagittal suture leads to endochondral ossification of the suture mesenchyme and sagittal synostosis, presumably by inhibiting Twist1. Classic Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is characterized by coronal synostosis, and the haploinsufficient Twist1(+/-) mice represents a suitable model for studying this syndrome. Thus, we seeked to understand the underlying ossification process in coronal craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice. Our data indicate that coronal suture closure in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs between postnatal day 9 and 13 by endochondral ossification, as shown by histology, gene expression analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, this study reveals that coronal craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs through endochondral ossification.

Based on a genome-wide linkage analysis using Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip genotyping data from 57 half-sib and full-sib progeny, this locus was mapped to a 1.7 Mb interval on bovine chromosome 4. Within this region, the TWIST1 gene encoding a transcription factor was considered as a strong candidate gene since its haploinsufficiency is responsible for the human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, characterized by skull coronal suture synostosis. Sequencing of the TWIST1 gene identified a c.148_157dup (p.A56RfsX87) frame-shift mutation predicted to completely inactivate this gene. Genotyping 17 scurred and 20 horned founders of our pedigree as well as 48 unrelated horned controls revealed a perfect association between this mutation and the type 2 scurs phenotype. Subsequent genotyping of 32 individuals born from heterozygous parents showed that homozygous mutated progeny are completely absent, which is consistent with the embryonic lethality reported in Drosophila and mouse suffering from TWIST1 complete insufficiency. Finally, data from previous studies on model species and a fine description of type 2 scurs symptoms allowed us to propose different mechanisms to explain the features of this syndrome.

Haploinsufficiency of the human TWIST1 gene, which causes the craniosynostosis disorder Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), is related to failure to repress transcription of CDKN1A (which encodes p21/WAF1/CIP1), promoting osteoblast differentiation. We have examined the functional significance of natural TWIST1 variants present in craniosynostosis patients and in their healthy relatives. Both deletion and duplication variants of the glycine-rich tract Gly5AlaGly5 inhibited E2A (E12/E47)-dependent transcription of CDKN1A to a similar degree as wild-type protein, indicating that the length of this glycine tract is not critical for efficient transcriptional repression. We also evaluated a newly identified heterozygous TWIST1 variant (c.115C&gt;G, encoding p.Arg39Gly), located within a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS), that was present in a child with mild SCS and her clinically unaffected father and grandmother. Unlike wild-type protein, this mutant required cotransfected E12 to localize to the nucleus, indicating that the NLS, including amino acid 39, is essential for nuclear localization; inhibition of E2A-dependent transcription of CDKN1A occurred normally.

Human genetic studies have identified several genes in association with CS. One such gene that has been implicated in both syndromic (Saethre-Chotzen syndrome) and nonsyndromic forms of CS in humans is TWIST1. In this study, a heterozygous Twist1 knock out (Twist1(+/-) ) mouse model was used to study the craniofacial shape changes associated with the partial loss of function. A geometric morphometric approach was used to analyze landmark data derived from microcomputed tomography scans to compare craniofacial shape between 17 Twist1(+/-) mice and 26 of their Twist1(+/+) (wild type) littermate controls at 15 days of age. The results show that despite the purported wide variation in synostotic severity, Twist1(+/-) mice have a consistent pattern of craniofacial dysmorphology affecting all major regions of the skull. Similar to Saethre-Chotzen, the calvarium is acrocephalic and wide with an overall brachycephalic shape. Mutant mice also exhibited a shortened cranial base and a wider and shorted face, consistent with coronal CS associated phenotypes. The results suggest that these differences are at least partially the direct result of the Twist1 haploinsufficiency on the developing craniofacial skeleton. This study provides a quantitative phenotype complement to the developmental and molecular genetic research previously done on Twist1.

Although the functional impacts of many TWIST1 mutations have been experimentally reported, little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying their loss-of-function. In a previous study, we highlighted the predictive value of in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in deciphering the molecular function of TWIST1 residues. Here, since the substitution of the arginine 154 amino acid by a glycine residue (R154G) is responsible for the SCS phenotype and the substitution of arginine 154 by a proline experimentally decreases the dimerizing ability of TWIST1, we investigated the molecular impact of this point mutation using MD approaches. Consistently, MD simulations highlighted a clear decrease in the stability of the \u03b1-helix during the dimerization of the mutated R154P TWIST1/E12 dimer compared to the wild-type TE complex, which was further confirmed in vitro using immunoassays. Our study demonstrates that MD simulations provide a structural explanation for the loss-of-function associated with the SCS TWIST1 mutation and provides a proof of concept of the predictive value of these MD simulations.

To detect chromosomal rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300 regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene. We found seven imbalances (27%): four de novo and three inherited rearrangements not reported among the copy number variants. A de novo 7p21.1 deletion of 500 kb included the TWIST1 gene, a suggested candidate for RSTS that is responsible for the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, an entity that enters in differential diagnosis with RSTS. A similar issue of differential diagnosis was raised by a large 4.3 Mb 2q22.3q23.1 deletion encompassing ZEB2, the gene responsible for the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, whose signs may overlap with RSTS. Positional candidate genes could not be sought in the remaining pathogenetic imbalances, because of the size of the involved region (a 9 Mb 2q24.3q31.1 deletion) and/or the relative paucity of suitable genes (a 5 Mb 3p13p12.3 duplication). One of the inherited rearrangements, the 17q11.2 379Kb duplication, represents the reciprocal event of the deletion underlying an overgrowth syndrome, both being mediated by the NF1-REP-P1 and REP-P2 sub-duplicons.

Twist1 has been shown to play both positive and negative roles in mesenchymal specification and differentiation, and here we show that the activity of Twist1 is dependent on its dimer partner. Twist1 forms both homodimers (T/T) and heterodimers with E2A E proteins (T/E) and the relative level of Twist1 to the HLH inhibitor Id proteins determines which dimer forms. On the basis of the expression patterns of Twist1 and Id1 within the cranial sutures, we hypothesized that Twist1 forms homodimers in the osteogenic fronts and T/E heterodimers in the mid-sutures. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that genes regulated by T/T homodimers, such as FGFR2 and periostin, are expressed in the osteogenic fronts, whereas genes regulated by T/E heterodimers, such as thrombospondin-1, are expressed in the mid-sutures. The ratio between these dimers is altered in the sutures of Twist1+/- mice, favoring an increase in homodimers and an expansion of the osteogenic fronts. Of interest, the T/T to T/E ratio is greater in the coronal versus the sagittal suture, and this finding may contribute to making the coronal suture more susceptible to fusion due to TWIST haploinsufficiency. Importantly, we were able to inhibit suture fusion in Twist1+/- mice by modulating the balance between these dimers toward T/E formation, by either increasing the expression of E2A E12 or by decreasing Id expression. Therefore, we have identified dimer partner selection as an important mediator of Twist1 function and provide a mechanistic understanding of craniosynostosis due to TWIST haploinsufficiency.",

TWIST-1 haploinsufficiency, leads to alterations in suture mesenchyme cellular gene expression patterns, resulting in aberrant osteogenesis and craniosynostosis. We analyzed the expression of the TWIST-1 target, Tyrosine kinase receptor c-ros-oncogene 1 (C-ROS-1) in TWIST-1 haploinsufficient calvarial cells derived from SCS patients and calvaria of Twist-1<sup>del/+</sup> mutant mice and found it to be highly expressed when compared to TWIST-1 wild-type controls. Knock-down of C-ROS-1 expression in TWIST-1 haploinsufficient calvarial cells derived from SCS patients was associated with decreased capacity for osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of human SCS calvarial cells with the tyrosine kinase chemical inhibitor, Crizotinib, resulted in reduced C-ROS-1 activity and the osteogenic potential of human SCS calvarial cells with minor effects on cell viability or proliferation. Cultured human SCS calvarial cells treated with Crizotinib exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity and mineral deposition, with an associated decrease in expression levels of Runt-related transcription factor 2 and OSTEOPONTIN, with reduced PI3K/Akt signalling in vitro. Furthermore, Crizotinib treatment resulted in reduced BMP-2 mediated bone formation potential of whole Twist-1<sup>del/+</sup> mutant mouse calvaria organotypic cultures. Collectively, these results suggest that C-ROS-1 promotes osteogenic differentiation of TWIST-1 haploinsufficient calvarial osteogenic progenitor cells. Furthermore, the aberrant osteogenic potential of these cells is inhibited by the reduction of C-ROS-1. Therefore, targeting C-ROS-1 with a pharmacological agent, such as Crizotinib, may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate craniosynostosis associated with aberrant TWIST-1 function.",

Furthermore, using different molecular techniques, pathogenic mutations in the TWIST gene were identified in 71 percent of patients. Patients with deletions of the TWIST gene did not differ from those with intragenic TWIST mutations in frequency or severity of craniofacial abnormalities. However, they did distinguish themselves by the presence of many additional anomalies and diseases and--most importantly--the high frequency of mental retardation, which was borderline significant.

A predefined voting process was applied, current levels of evidence and strengths of recommendation were assigned and participants ultimately voted independently on their level of agreement with each of the items. The task force agreed on 5 overarching principles and 12 recommendations concerning use of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GCs); biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, sarilumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib). Guidance on monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and tapering on sustained clinical remission is provided. Cost and sequencing of b/tsDMARDs are addressed. Initially, MTX plus GCs and upon insufficient response to this therapy within 3 to 6 months, stratification according to risk factors is recommended. With poor prognostic factors (presence of autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions or failure of two csDMARDs), any bDMARD or JAK inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, any other bDMARD (from another or the same class) or tsDMARD is recommended. On sustained remission, DMARDs may be tapered, but not be stopped. Levels of evidence and levels of agreement were mostly high. These updated EULAR recommendations provide consensus on the management of RA with respect to benefit, safety, preferences and cost.",

However, the expression and biological role of miR-301b in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Here we aimed to evaluate the roles and mechanisms of miR-301b in TNBC cells. miR-301b expression was assessed in TNBC specimens and cell lines by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). TNBC cells were transfected with miR-301b mimics, inhibitors or Cylindromatosis (CYLD) small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000. The functional roles of miR-301b were determined by cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays. Western blots and qRT-PCR were used to measure the expression of mRNAs and proteins in the cells. We found that miR-301b was upregulated in TNBC specimens and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-301b promoted cell proliferation in TNBC cells, while inhibited the apoptosis induced by 5-FU. CYLD was downregulated by miR-301b at both mRNA and protein levels in TNBC cells. Dual-luciferase report assay confirmed that miR-301b downregulated CYLD by direct interaction with the 3'-untranslated region(3'-UTR) of CYLD mRNA. NF-\u03baB activation was mechanistically associated with miR-301b-mediated downregulation of CYLD. However, inhibition of miR-301b reversed all the effects of miR-301b. In conclusion, miR-301b plays an oncogenic role in TNBC possibly by downregulating CYLD and subsequently activating NF-\u03baB p65, and this may provide a novel therapeutic approach for TNBC.

The protein export apparatus consists of a PMF-driven transmembrane export gate complex and a cytoplasmic ATPase complex. In addition, the basal body C ring acts as a sorting platform for the cytoplasmic ATPase complex that efficiently brings export substrates and type III export chaperone-substrate complexes from the cytoplasm to the export gate complex.

The bacterial flagellum is a macromolecular protein complex that is more than five times the cell length. Flagella-driven motility is coordinated via a chemosensory signal transduction pathway, and so bacterial cells sense changes in the environment and migrate towards more desirable locations. The flagellum of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is composed of a bi-directional rotary motor, a universal joint and a helical propeller. The flagellar motor, which structurally resembles an artificial motor, is embedded within the cell envelop and spins at several hundred revolutions per second. In contrast to an artificial motor, the energy utilized for high-speed flagellar motor rotation is the inward-directed proton flow through a transmembrane proton channel of the stator unit of the flagellar motor. The flagellar motor realizes efficient chemotaxis while performing high-speed movement by an ingenious directional switching mechanism of the motor rotation. To build the universal joint and helical propeller structures outside the cell body, the flagellar motor contains its own protein transporter called a type III protein export apparatus.

However, the late stage of the flagellar formation process remained to be examined in the IMVs. In this study, we showed that the filament-type proteins are transported into the IMVs to produce the filament on the hook inside the IMVs. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that coordinated flagellar protein export and assembly can occur at the post-translational level.

Temporal and spatial expression of SNAT4 during liver development was investigated. Regulation of SNAT4 by HNF4\u03b1 was examined by promoter analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Metabolic labeling and western blotting were carried out using primary hepatoblasts with SNAT4 overexpression. The expression of Slc38a4 encoding SNAT4 showed a marked perinatal increase, and was predominant among system A amino acid transporters. It was first detected in embryonic day 18.5 liver, and found in most hepatocytes after birth. Three alternative first exons were found in the SNAT4 gene. Promoter analyses using approximately 3-kb fragments corresponding to each first exon (AP1, AP2, AP3) revealed that AP1 and AP2 exhibited strong promoter activity in mouse hepatoblasts with endogenous HNF4\u03b1. Transactivation of AP2 was upregulated by HNF4\u03b1 in HeLa cells without endogenous HNF4\u03b1. EMSA has demonstrated that HNF4\u03b1 directly binds to cis-elements in AP2. Overexpression of SNAT4 facilitated amino acid uptake and de novo protein synthesis in primary hepatoblasts.

Here we use mouse genetics to address the role of UPF2, a core NMD component, in the development, function and regeneration of the liver. We find that loss of NMD during fetal liver development is incompatible with postnatal life due to failure of terminal differentiation. Moreover, deletion of Upf2 in the adult liver results in hepatosteatosis and disruption of liver homeostasis. Finally, NMD was found to be absolutely required for liver regeneration.

Correspondingly, genetically engineered mouse models expressing mutant IDH in the adult liver show an aberrant response to hepatic injury, characterized by HNF-4\u03b1 silencing, impaired hepatocyte differentiation, and markedly elevated levels of cell proliferation. Moreover, IDH and Kras mutations, genetic alterations that co-exist in a subset of human IHCCs, cooperate to drive the expansion of liver progenitor cells, development of premalignant biliary lesions, and progression to metastatic IHCC.

Our real-time PCR and Western blot data showed that the Hnf4a1 5' UTR caused a remarkable translational suppression regardless of a moderate effect on Hnf4a1 mRNA levels. The subsequent deletion/mutation analysis of Hnf4a1 5' UTR using dual-luciferase reporter assays further demonstrated that although the disruption of the chemically highly stable 4-ring G4 resulted in a marked attenuation of inhibition, the G4 alone only weakly inhibited translation. Likewise, disruption of a long stem-loop adjacent to the 4-ring G4 markedly attenuated translational inhibition, although the stem-loop alone only exerted a weak inhibitory effect. Thus, the tight conjunction of G4s and an adjacent stem-loop within the Hnf4a1 5' UTR was both necessary and sufficient to mediate the very strong translational repression. Our results establish a novel working model that a chemically stable G4 may require co-factors to be bio-stable for exerting biological functions.",

We identified the in vitro presence of a stable secondary structure, G-quadruplex (G4) in the 5' UTR of P1-HNF4A, the predominant HNF4\u03b1 isoform(s) in adult liver. Our data suggest that the cooperation of G4 and the adjacent putative protein-binding sites within the 5' UTR was necessary and sufficient to mediate a strong translational repression. This was supported by analysis of deleted/mutated 5'UTRs and two native regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5'UTR. Additional results indicated that G4 motifs in the 5' UTRs of other liver-enriched transcription factors also inhibited protein expression. Moreover, pyridostatin, a G4 ligand, specifically potentiated the translational suppressing effect of P1-HNF4A-5' UTR. In summary, the present study provides the first evidence of the presence of G4 in human P1-HNF4A-5' UTR in vitro, and establishes a novel working model of strong inhibition of protein translation via interactions of G4 with potential RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The protein expression of the tumor suppressor HNF4\u03b1 may be inhibited by interactions of RBPs with the G4 motif in the 5' UTR to promote cell proliferation during liver development and carcinogenesis.",

Metabolism of xenobiotics, such as environmental chemicals and drugs by the liver protects us from toxic effects of these xenobiotics, whereas metabolism of cholesterol, bile acids (BAs), lipids, and glucose provide key building blocks and nutrients to promote the growth or maintain the survival of the organism. As a well-established master regulator of liver development and function, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4<i>\u03b1</i>) plays a critical role in regulating a large number of key genes essential for the metabolism of xenobiotics, metabolic wastes, and nutrients. The expression and activity of HNF4<i>\u03b1</i> is regulated by diverse hormonal and signaling pathways such as growth hormone, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, insulin, transforming growth factor-<i>\u03b2</i>, estrogen, and cytokines. HNF4<i>\u03b1</i> appears to play a central role in orchestrating the transduction of extracellular hormonal signaling and intracellular stress/nutritional signaling onto transcriptional changes in the liver. There have been a few reviews on the regulation of drug metabolism, lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, and inflammation by HNF4<i>\u03b1</i>. However, the knowledge on how the expression and transcriptional activity of HNF4<i>\u03b1</i> is modulated remains scattered.

The HNF4A gene uses two separate promoters P1 and P2, with P1 products predominant in adult liver, whereas P2 products prevalent in fetal liver, pancreas, and liver/colon cancer. To date, the mechanisms for the regulation of HNF4A and the dynamic switch of P1-HNF4\u03b1 and P2-HNF4\u03b1 during ontogenesis and carcinogenesis are still obscure. Our study validated the previously reported self-stimulation of P1-HNF4\u03b1 but invalidated the reported synergism between HNF4\u03b1 and HNF1\u03b1. HNF4A-AS1, a long noncoding RNA, is localized between the P2 and P1 promoters of HNF4A. We identified critical roles of P1-HNF4\u03b1 in regulating the expression of HNF4A-AS1 and its mouse ortholog Hnf4a-os. Paired box 6 (PAX6), a master regulator of pancreas development overexpressed in colon cancer, cooperated with HNF1\u03b1 to induce P2-HNF4\u03b1 but antagonized HNF4\u03b1 in HNF4A-AS1 expression. Thus, PAX6 may be important in determining ontogenic and carcinogenic changes of P2-HNF4\u03b1 and HNF4A-AS1 in the pancreas and intestine. We also interrogated transactivation activities on multiple gene targets by multiple known and novel HNF4\u03b1 mutants identified in patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1) and liver cancer. Particularly, HNF4\u03b1-D78A and HNF4\u03b1-G79S, two mutants found in liver cancer with mutations in DNA-binding domain, displayed highly gene-specific transactivation activities. Interestingly, HNF4\u03b1-Q277X, a MODY1 truncation mutant, antagonized the transactivation activities of HNF1\u03b1 and farnesoid X receptor, key regulators of insulin secretion.

However, it remains unclear how lineage-specifying transcription factors, which are often expressed in both progenitor and mature cell populations, influence cell differentiation. Using in vivo mouse liver development as a model, we identified thousands of enhancers that are bound by the master regulators HNF4A and FOXA2 in a differentiation-dependent manner, subject to chromatin remodeling, and associated with differentially expressed target genes. Enhancers exclusively occupied in the embryo were found to be responsive to developmentally regulated TEAD2 and coactivator YAP1. Our data suggest that Hippo signaling may affect hepatocyte differentiation by influencing HNF4A and FOXA2 interactions with temporal enhancers.

Liver-specific gene expression is controlled primarily at a transcriptional level. Studies on the transcriptional regulatory elements of genes expressed in hepatocytes have identified several liver-enriched transcriptional factors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1, HNF-3, HNF-4, HNF-6 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein families, which are key components of the differentiation process for the fully functional liver. The transcriptional regulation by these HNFs, which form a hierarchical and cooperative network, is both essential for hepatocyte differentiation during mammalian liver development and also crucial for metabolic regulation and liver function. Among these liver-enriched transcription factors, HNF-4 is likely to act the furthest upstream as a master gene in transcriptional cascade and interacts with other liver-enriched transcriptional factors to stimulate hepatocyte-specific gene transcription. A link between the extracellular matrix, changes in cytoskeletal filament assembly and hepatocyte differentiation via HNF-4 has been shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of liver-specific gene expression.

Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 \u00d7 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport.

In 2019, FDA approved givosiran for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria. The objective of this research was to estimate and compare the total cost of AIP-related healthcare for patients treated with hemin or givosiran. A microsimulation cost model was developed to estimate the annual economic impact of hemin versus givosiran treatment for patients with AIP from the U.S. healthcare payer perspective. Hemin treatment costs were calculated from the Hemin Shipment Data in which patients were defined as receiving acute attack treatment or prophylaxis treatment based on shipment patterns. Three separate hemin subpopulations were considered: one attack per year, multiple attacks per year, and hemin prophylaxis. Treatment costs for givosiran (with hemin for acute attacks) were simulated based on Phase III trial efficacy results applied to individual treatment histories in the Hemin Shipment Data. Other healthcare utilization was also considered. Outcomes were annualized and expenditures inflated to 2019. For all patients with AIP, the average annual total cost of care with hemin was 78% lower (difference = $482,113; 95% CI=$373,638-$594,778) than the average annual total cost of care with givosiran. Average annual total cost of care with hemin was between 46% and 92% lower than givosiran for the three hemin subpopulations: one attack per year (difference = $545,219; 95% CI=$436,584-$657,239), multiple attacks per year (difference = $459,366; 95% CI=$350,291-$574,403), and hemin prophylaxis (difference = $311,950; 95% CI=$191,898-$435,893). Cost savings with hemin were robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity as well as scenario analyses. Hemin is expected to provide cost savings compared to givosiran for all AIP patients and subpopulations. Lower annual total costs of care with hemin range from $311,950 to $545,219 less depending on whether the patient uses hemin prophylactically or for acute treatment attacks.",

Intravenous injection of heme is the most effective method of treating acute attacks. Carbohydrate loading is used when heme is unavailable or in the event of mild attacks. Symptomatic treatment is also needed during attacks. Prevention of attacks includes eliminating precipitating factors, heme prophylaxis and liver transplantation. New treatment options include givosiran (siRNA) to down-regulate ALA synthase-1 (ALAS1) and the messenger RNA of PBGD (PBGD mRNA) delivered to the liver cells of patients with AIP.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding hydroxymethylbilane synthase, can lead to hepatocyte overaccumulation and systemic distribution of the proximal porphyrin precursors, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). ALA and PBG are toxic to neurons and extrahepatic tissue and cause the neurovisceral clinical manifestations of AIP. Management of AIP includes awareness and avoidance of triggering factors, infusions of hemin for severe acute attacks, and, if indicated for chronic suppressive therapy, maintenance treatment with hemin or givosiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that antagonizes ALA synthase 1 transcripts. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is most commonly caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the gene encoding ferrochelatase (FECH), the heme pathway terminal enzyme. FECH deficiency leads to erythrocyte overaccumulation and high plasma levels of lipophilic protoporphyrins that photoactivate in the skin, causing burning pain and erythema. Protoporphyrins excreted in the bile can cause gallstones, cholestasis, fibrosis, and ultimately liver failure. Management of EPP includes skin protection and afamelanotide, an \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone analog that increases melanin pigment and reduces photoactivation. Liver transplantation may be necessary for severe EPP-induced liver complications. Because AIP and EPP arise from defects in the heme biosynthetic pathway, hematologists are often consulted to evaluate and manage suspected or proven porphyrias.

The porphyrias are a group of disorders in which enzymatic deficiencies in heme production lead to toxic accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which are involved in the neurovisceral attacks. Givosiran acts as a conventional siRNA to trigger RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing on delta-ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), thus returning ALA and PBG metabolites to the physiological level to attenuate further neurotoxicity. Givosiran makes use of a new hepatic-delivery system that conjugates three GalNac (N-acetylgalactosamine) molecules to the siRNA passenger strand.

To test this hypothesis, we transplanted male wild-type (WT) and TNF-alpha deficient (KO) mice with either TNF-alpha-sufficient (TNF-alpha(+/+)) or TNF-alpha-deficient (TNF-alpha(-/-)) bone marrow. After consuming a high-fat diet for 26 wk, metabolic and morphometric characteristics of the animals were analyzed. While there were no differences in terms of relative weight gain, body composition analysis yielded a lower relative adipose and higher relative lean mass in mice lacking TNF-alpha, which was partially explained by reduced epididymal fat pad and liver weight. TNF-alpha(-/-) --&gt;KO mice exhibited enhanced insulin sensitivity compared with that observed in TNF-alpha(+/+)--&gt;KO mice; remarkably, no protection against insulin resistance was provided by transplanting TNF-alpha(-/-) bone marrow in WT mice compared with TNF-alpha(+/+)--&gt;WT.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15813957": "BACKGROUND: Recent findings have established an association between obesity and immune dysfunction. However, most of the studies investigating the effects of obesity on immune function have been carried out in genetically obese rodent models. Since human obesity is mostly due to intake of a high fat diet and decreased energy expenditure, we asked whether immunological defects also occur in diet-induced obesity. Specifically, we focused on the function of monocytes and macrophages, as these cells are thought to be involved in the low-grade inflammation present in obesity. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat or a standard chow diet for either 2 or 10 weeks. At the end of the intervention period animals were anaesthetised, blood collected for determination of plasma mediator concentrations and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated production of TNF-alpha by monocytes. LPS stimulated production of TNF-alpha in alveolar macrophages was also determined. RESULTS: High-fat feeding for either 2 or 10 weeks resulted in significant increases in fat mass and serum leptin. Although increased serum leptin has previously been linked to modulation of innate immunity, we found no significant difference in the LPS stimulated production of TNF-alpha by either blood monocytes or alveolar macrophages between the dietary groups. Furthermore, we failed to find a significant increase in circulating TNF-alpha concentrations in obese animals, as reported for genetically obese animals. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that defects in innate immune function observed in genetically obese animals are not mimicked by dietary obesity, and may more likely reflect the gross abnormality in leptin function of these models. Further work is required delineate the effects of dietary obesity on inflammatory state and immune function.",

This concept is based on studies of obese rodents and humans, and cell culture models. TNF elicits cellular responses via two receptors called p55 and p75. Our purpose was to test the involvement of TNF in glucose homeostasis using mice lacking one or both TNF receptors. C57BL/6 mice lacking p55 (p55(-)/-), p75, (p75(-)/-), or both receptors (p55(-)/-p75(-)/-) were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity. Marked fasting hyperinsulinemia was seen for p55(-)/-p75(-)/- males between 12 and 16 wk of feeding the high-fat diet. Insulin levels were four times greater than wild-type mice. In contrast, p55(-)/- and p75(-)/- mice exhibited insulin levels that were similar or reduced, respectively, as compared with wild-type mice. In addition, high-fat diet-fed p75(-)/- mice had the lowest body weights and leptin levels, and improved insulin sensitivity. Obese (db/db) mice, which are not responsive to leptin, were used to study the role of p55 in severe obesity. Male p55(-)/-db/db mice exhibited threefold higher insulin levels and twofold lower glucose levels at 20 wk of age than control db/db expressing p55. All db/db mice remained severely insulin resistant based on fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Our data do not support the concept that TNF, acting via its receptors, is a major contributor to obesity-associated insulin resistance. In fact, data suggest that the two TNF receptors work in concert to protect against diabetes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9644096": "Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of insulin resistance, dyslipoproteinemia, and hypercoagulability. In a more recently established hypothesis of body weight control and regulation of metabolism, the adipocyte secretes leptin and locally expresses TNF-alpha, the latter being responsible for the expression of metabolic cardiovascular risk factors. TNF-a mRNA expression and TNF-alpha protein are greatly increased in adipose tissue from obese animals and humans. Elevated TNF-alpha expression induces insulin resistance by downregulating the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor and decreasing the expression of GLUT-4 glucose transporters. TNF-alpha also reduces lipoprotein lipase activity in white adipocytes, stimulates hepatic lipolysis, and increases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 content in adipocytes. Moreover, adipocytes secrete leptin, a molecule with a secondary cytokine structure whose concentrations correlate with the amount of fat tissue. Increased leptin levels downregulate appetite and increase sympathetic activity and thermogenesis in the hypothalamus. Diet-induced weight loss reduces adipose TNF-alpha expression and serum leptin levels and is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. Although exercise has also been shown to reduce leptin levels, an influence on TNF-a expression in adipocytes or muscle cells has not yet been demonstrated.",

The biochemical basis of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has been the subject of many studies. Earlier studies have indicated that quantitative regulation of the insulin sensitive glucose transporters (Glut-4) and insulin receptors themselves may contribute to this disorder, however, these two factors are probably inadequate to explain the extent of insulin resistance. This point also became apparent by the development of only mild hyperinsulinaemia in mice with a targeted mutation in the Glut-4 gene. Studies on postreceptor defects in type 2 diabetes has recently focused on the intrinsic catalytic activity of the insulin receptor and downstream signalling events. A reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) has been noted in both animal and human type 2 diabetes. Importantly, this appears to occur in all of the major insulin-sensitive tissues, namely the muscle, fat and liver. It is now clear that decreased signalling capacity of the insulin receptor is an important component of this disease. I will review some of the potential mechanisms underlying this deficiency.",

Obesity is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with a condition of vascular low-grade inflammation. Analysis of available basic or clinical papers published in peer-reviewed international journals on microcirculation and obesity. Vascular low-grade inflammation, which characterizes obesity, is secondary to abnormal production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1. TNF-\u03b1, generated either in small vessels or within the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) of patients with obesity, stimulates reactive oxygen species generation, mainly through NAD(P)H oxidase activation, which in turn reduces nitric oxide (NO) availability. These aspects are highlighted by the insulin resistance status and macronutrient intake that characterize the obesity condition. Oxidant excess has also been proposed as a mechanism whereby TNF-\u03b1 interferes with the endothelin-1/NO system at the level of small vessels from patients with obesity. In obesity, microvasculature from visceral fat is an important source of low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress that, together with the PVAT, directly contribute to vascular changes, favoring the development and acceleration of the vascular atherothrombotic process in this clinical condition.",

To delineate the role of TNFR1-mediated TNF-alpha signaling in the pathogenesis of this disorder, a TNFR1 blocking peptide-Fc fusion protein (TNFR1BP-Fc) was used for the present study. Wistar rats were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet for 16 wk until obesity and insulin resistance developed. In comparison with increased body weight and fat weight, enlarged adipocytes, and hypertriglyceridemia in the obese state, the subsequent 4-wk treatment with TNFR1BP-Fc resulted in significant weight loss characterized by decreased fat pad weight and adipocyte size and reduced plasma triglycerides. Furthermore, obesity-induced insulin resistance, including hyperinsulinemia, elevated C-peptide, higher degree of hyperglycemia after glucose challenge, and less hypoglycemic response to insulin, was markedly improved, and the compensatory hyperplasia and hypertrophy of pancreatic islets were reduced. Interestingly, treatment with TNFR1BP-Fc markedly suppressed systemic TNF-alpha release and its local expression in pancreatic islets and muscle and adipose tissues. In addition, blockage of TNFR1-mediated TNF-alpha signaling in obese rats significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in the muscle and fat tissues. Our results strongly suggest a pivotal role for TNFR1-mediated TNF-alpha signaling in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance.

Complete lack of TNF-alpha function through targeted mutations in TNF-alpha gene or both of its receptors results in significant improvement of insulin sensitivity in dietary, chemical, or genetic models of rodent obesity.

In the ob/ob mice, the absence of p55 caused a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity. p75 deficiency alone did not affect insulin sensitivity but might potentiate the effects of p55 deficiency in animals lacking both TNFRs.

Plasma concentrations of the two soluble TNF-alpha receptors were measured in 49 obese subjects (mean body mass index (BMI): 44.9 kg/m2, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 42.3-47.5 kg/m2, including 19 type 2 diabetic individuals) and 28 lean controls, by using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) technique. TNF-alpha concentrations were determined in 28 obese (10 with diabetes) and 23 lean subjects. The obese subjects showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of the soluble p60 and p80 TNF receptor, respectively, compared to the lean control group, independent of the presence of diabetes. Multiple regression analysis, with the p80 TNF receptor as dependent variable, revealed that BMI and log insulin significantly affected the plasma concentration of this soluble receptor subtype, explaining 46% of the variance, whereas for the p60 TNF receptor, only BMI turned out to influence plasma concentrations. TNF-alpha plasma concentrations were not different between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test: P=0.34), but due to the low power of the test, an effect of obesity on TNF-alpha is not excluded. These data indicate that plasma concentrations of both soluble TNF receptors are elevated in obesity and insulin resistance, possibly as a function of excess body fat. The reported adipose overexpression of TNF-alpha does not seem to be reflected by elevated plasma concentrations, suggesting a primarily local role of the cytokine.",

In this context, nuclear factor \u03ba-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB) is directly involved and required for the acute activation of the inflammatory gene program. Here, we show that the major transactivating subunit of NF\u03baB, v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA), is also required for acute TNF-induced suppression of adipocyte genes. Notably, this repression does not involve RELA binding to the associated enhancers but rather loss of cofactors and enhancer RNA (eRNA) selectively from high-occupancy sites within super-enhancers. Based on these data, we have developed models that, with high accuracy, predict which enhancers and genes are repressed by TNF in adipocytes. We show that these models are applicable to other cell types where TNF represses genes associated with super-enhancers in a highly cell-type-specific manner.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8662983": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a central role in the state of insulin resistance associated with obesity. It has previously been shown that one important mechanism by which TNF-alpha interferes with insulin signaling is through the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which can then function as an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR). However, the receptors and the signaling pathway used by TNF-alpha that mediate the inhibition of IR activity are unknown. We show here that human TNF-alpha, which binds only to the murine p55 TNF receptor (TNFR), is as effective at inhibiting insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 in adipocytes and myeloid 32D cells as murine TNF-alpha, which binds to both p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR. Likewise, antibodies that are specific agonists for p55 TNFR or p75 TNFR demonstrate that stimulation of p55 TNFR is sufficient to inhibit insulin signaling, though a small effect can also be seen with antibodies to p75 TNFR. Exogenous sphingomyelinase and ceramides, known to be formed by activation of p55 TNFR, inhibit IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase in vitro. Myeloid 32D cells expressing IR and IRS-1 are sensitive to this inhibition, but cells expressing IR and IRS-2 are resistant, pointing to an important difference in the biological function between IRS-1 and IRS-2. These data strongly suggest that TNF-alpha inhibits insulin signaling via stimulation of p55 TNFR and sphingomyelinase activity, which results in the production of an inhibitory form of IRS-1.",

We assessed glucose tolerance and reproductive outcome in mice infused with saline, or 2 mug or 4 mug recombinant mouse (rm)TNF-alpha by subcutaneous mini-osmotic pumps between days (d)11.5 and 18.5 of gestation. Subsequently, we studied the effects of the 2-mug dose on maternal AT metabolism. Finally, the growth of offspring exposed to 2 mug rmTNF-alpha in utero was followed until 8 weeks postnatal age. At 8 weeks, we assessed AT accumulation, as well as adipocyte area in white AT and insulin sensitivity in males, and adipokine mRNA levels in various AT depots in females.

The female but not male offspring of these mice showed accelerated growth, hyperadiposity, robustly increased leptin expression in all AT depots, and raised fasting blood glucose. TNF-alpha infusion (2 mug for 7 days) in gravid mice resulted in a mild GDM syndrome and accelerated AT development in the offspring in a sex-specific manner.

Plasma concentrations of the soluble fraction of the TNF receptors 1 and 2 (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) are thought to reflect the degree of activation of the TNF system. The purpose of this study was to explore whether this activation, as measured by the levels of circulating sTNFR1 and sTNFR2, is associated with insulin resistance. A total of 19 men (mean age 36.2 +/- 1.9; BMI 28.8 +/- 1.2, range 22.2-35.7) and 17 premenopausal women (age 34.9 +/- 1.4; BMI 28.1 +/- 0.8, range 19-37.9) were studied. Men showed higher levels of plasma sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 than women. However, obese men showed increased levels of sTNFR2 but similar levels of sTNFR1 in comparison with obese women. In fact, sTNFR2 levels correlated with BMI (r = 0.50, P = 0.002), fat-free mass (FFM) (r = 0.61, P &lt; 0.0001), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.39, P = 0.02), but not with fat mass or percent fat mass. sTNFR2 levels correlated with basal glucose levels (r = 0.45, P = 0.007), area under the curve (AUC) for glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (r = 0.42, P = 0.013), and with the quotient AUC glucose/log AUC insulin (r = 0.41, P = 0.015). sTNFR2 also correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity (S(I)), evaluated using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis (r = -0.38, P = 0.02). Plasma sTNFR1 levels were not associated with any of these variables. Because WHR influenced both S(I) and sTNFR2 levels, we constructed a multiple linear regression to predict S(I), with WHR and sTNFR2 as independent variables. In this model, both WHR (P = 0.0078) and sTNFR2 levels (P = 0.025) contributed to 47% of the variance in S(I). In parallel with higher FFM, lean and obese men showed a lower S(I) (2.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.2 +/- 1.3 min(-1) x mU x l(-1), P = 0.001; and 1.15 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.8 min(-1) x mU x l(-1), P = 0.035, respectively) and higher sTNFR2 levels in comparison with lean and obese women, respectively. After controlling for FFM, the correlation between S(I) and sTNFR2 levels disappeared, indicating that FFM was significantly influencing these associations. In summary, plasma sTNFR2 levels, but not sTNFR1, were proportional to BMI, WHR, FFM (a well-known confounder in the evaluation of insulin sensitivity), basal and postload glucose levels, and insulin resistance.

The aim of the current study was to dissect the mechanism whereby pioglitazone, one of the TZDs, ameliorates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pioglitazone restored insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (DOG) uptake, which was reduced by TNF-alpha, with concomitant restorations in tyrosine phosphorylation and protein levels of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, as well as association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase activity. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of either wild-type human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma2 or a mutant carrying a replacement at the consensus mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site (hPPAR-gamma2-S112A) promoted adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and restored TNF-alpha-induced decrease of triglyceride in adipocytes as effectively as pioglitazone. Overexpression of the PPAR-gamma proteins in TNF-alpha-treated adipocytes restored protein levels of IR/IRS-1, but did not improve insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR/IRS-1 or insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake. These results indicate that the ability of pioglitazone to restore insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR/IRS-1, which is necessary for amelioration of TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance, may be independent of the adipogenic activity of PPAR-gamma that regulates protein levels of IR/IRS-1.",

To assess its putative role in diabetes we determined plasma levels of TNF alpha in 105 adult humans. Male nondiabetic subjects had significantly lower TNF alpha levels than female controls (4.4 +/- 0.3, n = 17 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.0 pg/ml, n = 13; p = 0.049). Men with NIDDM had elevated TNF alpha (6.7 +/- 0.6 pg/ml, n = 34) compared to nondiabetic subjects (4.4 +/- 0.3 pg/ml, n = 17; p = 0.012). Such a difference was not apparent in women. Levels of TNF alpha were correlated with serum triglyceride levels in male controls (r2 = 0.64; p = 0.007) but not in NIDDM. Neither body mass index nor glycosylated hemoglobin correlated with TNF alpha in any of the groups. The presence of retinopathy (p = 0.046) but not of neuropathy or nephropathy or macroangiopathy was associated with significantly elevated plasma TNF alpha. We conclude that plasma levels of TNF alpha are sex-dependent and that increased TNF alpha occurs in male but not female NIDDM and may participate in the development of diabetic complications.",

The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 are the most important elements of the insulin-signaling pathways, and mutations in this gene have been reported to play a role in determining insulin resistance, particulary in presence of obesity. The polymorpism of the TNF-a-308 gene is also involved in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance, therefore, we investigated whether the IRS-1 and TNF-a polymorphism can predict conversion to insulin resistance and obesity parameters in children with obesity. The 70 children with obesity simplex were included in this study (9-18 y.o). The antropometric investigations: weight, height, BMI, SDS for BMI, WHR, sum of 3, 10 skinfolds, and percent of body fat by Slaughter's equation was calculated. In each children after 12 hour overnight fast glucose, insulin, leptin and lipids: triglycerides (Tg), cholesterol total (Chol-T), cholesterol HDL (Chol-HDL), cholesterol LDL (Chol-LDL) were measured. The oral glucose tolerance test was performed and HOMA-IR was calculated. Two variants of genotypic IRS-1 were obtained: C/C(85.7 %), A/C(14.3%), and 3 variants of TNF-a G/G 68 % A/G 29% A/A 3%. Statistical analysis of anthropometric and biochemical variables in groups C/C, vs A/C and variables between IRS and TNF (G/G, A/G + A/A) groups was performed. We did not find any significant differences between these groups in the t-Student test. The girls heterozygous for the A allele--A/C (IRS) had higher body weight than girls who were homozygous C/C (chi(2) =3.87, Pr&gt;chi(2)=0,048). In smaller children studies, both polymorphism--IRS and TNF seems not to be associated with the degree of obesity and insulin resistance.",

We determined the polymorphic status of 11-\u03b2HSD1 4478T&gt;G and TNF-\u03b1-308G&gt;A in Asian Indians in north India. In this cross-sectional study (n = 498; 258 males, 240 females), association of genotypes (PCR\u2013RFLP) of 11-\u03b2HSD1 and TNF-\u03b1 were analyzed with obesity [BMI \u2265 25 kg/m(2), percentage body fat (%BF by DEXA); subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat area (L(2-3) level by single slice MRI) in a sub sample] and insulin resistance. 46 percent subjects had generalized obesity, 55 % abdominal obesity and 23.8 % were insulin resistant. Frequencies (%) of [T/T] and [T/G] genotypes of 11-\u03b2HSD1 were 89.57 and 10.43 respectively. Homozygosity for 11-\u03b2HSD1 4478G/G was absent with no association with parameters of obesity and insulin resistance. Frequencies (%) of TNF-\u03b1 [G] and [A] alleles were 88 and 12 respectively. Higher frequency of variant -308[A/A] was observed in females versus males (p = 0.01). Females with at least one single A allele of TNF-\u03b1-308G&gt;A had significantly high %BF and total skinfold, whereas higher values of waist hip ratio, total cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL were observed in males. Subjects with even a single A allele in TNF-\u03b1 genotype showed higher subscapular skinfold predisposing them to truncal subcutaneous adiposity (p = 0.02). Our findings of association of TNF-\u03b1-308G&gt;A variant in females with obesity indices suggests a gender-specific role of this polymorphism in obesity.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8899294": "Adipocytes produce a variety of molecules that are capable of functioning in both a paracrine and autocrine fashion. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the proteins produced by adipocytes that has been shown to regulate adipocyte function. Interestingly, adipocyte expression of TNF increases with increasing adipocyte mass and expression of TNF is increased in adipocytes isolated from several genetic models of rodent obesity and from obese humans. This finding has led to the idea that TNF produced by adipocytes functions as a local \"adipostat\" to limit fat accumulation. Increased production of TNF by adipocytes, however, may contribute to insulin resistance in obesity and in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). TNF has been shown to inhibit insulin-simulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and to stimulate downregulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, in adipocytes. These findings raise the possibility that pharmacological inhibition of TNF may provide a novel therapeutic target to treat patients with NIDDM.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30548217": "Inflammation contributes to obesity-related hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which often precede type 2 diabetes. Inflammation is one way that obesity can promote insulin resistance. It is not clear if the extent of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, or hyperglycemia, underpins changes in cellular immunity during diet-induced obesity. In particular, the requirement for obesity or directionality in the relationship between insulin resistance and monocyte characteristics is poorly defined. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can contribute to insulin resistance. It is unclear if TNF alters monocytosis or specific markers of cellular immunity in the context of obesity. We measured bone marrow and blood monocyte characteristics in WT and TNF<sup>-/-</sup> mice that were fed obesogenic, high fat (HF) diets. We also used hyperglycemic Akita mice and mice implanted with insulin pellets in order to determine if glucose or insulin were sufficient to alter monocyte characteristics. We found that diet-induced obesity in male mice increased the total number of monocytes in blood, but not in bone marrow. Immature, inflammatory (Ly6C<sup>high</sup> ) monocytes decreased within the bone marrow and increased within peripheral blood of HF-fed mice. We found that neither hyperinsulinemia nor hyperglycemia was sufficient to induce the observed changes in circulating monocytes in the absence of diet-induced obesity. In obese HF-fed mice, antibiotic treatment lowered insulin and insulin resistance, but did not alter circulating monocyte characteristics. Fewer Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes were present within the blood of HF-fed TNF<sup>-/-</sup> mice in comparison to HF-fed wild-type (WT) mice. The prevalence of immature Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in the blood correlated with serum insulin and insulin resistance irrespective of the magnitude of adipocyte or adipose tissue hypertrophy in obese mice. These data suggest that diet-induced obesity instigates a TNF-dependent increase in circulating inflammatory monocytes, which predicts increased blood insulin and insulin resistance independently from markers of adiposity or adipose tissue expansion.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9278582": "To maintain body weight, metabolic efficiency was promoted during evolution; two candidate genes for body weight regulation are lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Human fat cells do not synthesize lipid, but rely on LPL-mediated plasma triglyceride hydrolysis. Adipose LPL is elevated in obesity. Following weight loss, LPL is elevated further, suggesting attempts to maintain lipid stores during fasting and to replenish lipid stores during refeeding. Muscle LPL is regulated inversely to adipose LPL. Thus, an increased adipose/muscle LPL ratio would partition dietary lipid into adipose tissue and would explain some of the variability in weight gain when humans are exposed to excess calories. Adipose tissue TNFalpha expression is increased in obese rodents and humans and may be important in obesity. When insulin-resistant rodents were injected with anti-TNF binding protein, insulin action improved, suggesting a link between insulin resistance and TNF. TNF is expressed at higher levels in muscle cells of insulin-resistant subjects, and TNF may inhibit LPL expression. Overall, TNF may function to make the subject less obese by inhibiting LPL and rendering the animal more insulin resistant. Obesity has many components, both metabolic and behavioral. However, the metabolic changes resulting from LPL and TNF likely played a role in regulating body adipose tissue during much of human evolution and continue to affect human obesity today.",

An induction of TNF-alpha messenger RNA expression was observed in adipose tissue from four different rodent models of obesity and diabetes. TNF-alpha protein was also elevated locally and systemically. Neutralization of TNF-alpha in obese fa/fa rats caused a significant increase in the peripheral uptake of glucose in response to insulin. These results indicate a role for TNF-alpha in obesity and particularly in the insulin resistance and diabetes that often accompany obesity.",

Recent studies in animal models have indicated that TNF-alpha plays an important role in mediating the insulin resistance of obesity through its overexpression in fat tissue. However, the mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance and diabetes in humans remain largely unknown. In this study we examined the expression pattern of TNF-alpha mRNA in adipose tissues from 18 control and 19 obese premenopausal women by Northern blot analysis. TNF-alpha protein concentrations in plasma and in conditioned medium of explanted adipose tissue were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, the effects of weight reduction by dietary treatment of obesity on the adipose expression of TNF-alpha mRNA were also analyzed in nine premenopausal obese women, before and after a controlled weight-reduction program. These studies demonstrated that obese individuals express 2.5-fold more TNF-alpha mRNA in fat tissue relative to the lean controls (P &lt; 0.001). Similar increases were also observed in adipose production of TNF-alpha protein but circulating TNF-alpha levels were extremely low or undetectable. A strong positive correlation was observed between TNF-alpha mRNA expression levels in fat tissue and the level of hyperinsulinemia (P &lt; 0.001), an indirect measure of insulin resistance. Finally, body weight reduction in obese subjects which resulted in improved insulin sensitivity was also associated with a decrease in TNF-alpha mRNA expression (45%, P &lt; 0.001) in fat tissue. These results suggest a role for the abnormal regulation of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance.",

TNF-alpha expression is elevated in the adipose tissue of multiple experimental models of obesity. Neutralization of TNF-alpha in one of these models improves insulin sensitivity by increasing the activity of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, specifically in muscle and fat tissues. On a cellular level, TNF-alpha is a potent inhibitor of the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylations on the beta-chain of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1, suggesting a defect at or near the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. Given the clear link between obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, these results strongly suggest that TNF-alpha may play a crucial role in the systemic insulin resistance of NIDDM. This may allow for new treatments of disorders involving resistance to insulin.",

Although these changes may increase the risk for accelerated atherosclerosis and fatal myocardial infarction, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be defined. Although tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in the insulin resistance associated with obesity, its role in other disorders of obesity is largely unknown. In this report, we show that in obese (ob/ob) mice, neutralization of TNF-alpha or deletion of both TNF receptors (TNFRs) results in significantly reduced levels of plasma PAI-1 antigen, plasma insulin, and adipose tissue PAI-1 and TGF-beta mRNAs. Studies in which exogenous TNF-alpha was infused into lean mice lacking individual TNFRs indicate that TNF-alpha signaling of PAI-1 in adipose tissue can be mediated by either the p55 or the p75 TNFR. However, TNF-alpha signaling of TGF-beta mRNA expression in adipose tissue is mediated exclusively via the p55 TNFR. Our results suggest that TNF-alpha is a common link between the insulin resistance and elevated PAI-1 and TGF-beta in obesity. The chronic elevation of TNF-alpha in obesity thus may directly promote the development of the complex cardiovascular risk profile associated with this condition.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10668912": "Since evidence has appeared that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is involved in the loss of body fat in the course of wasting diseases, a large number of studies have investigated the physiological role of this cytokine in adipose tissue. TNF treatment of several in vitro models of adipogenesis clearly showed that TNF is a potent inhibitor of adipose differentiation. This antiadipogenic property is accompanied by suppression of developmental and metabolic markers of fat cell differentiation, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma2, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and GLUT4. Moreover, TNF promotes lipolysis in mature adipocytes and, subsequently, a reversion of the adipocyte phenotype. Recent studies demonstrated that TNF directly interferes with the insulin signaling cascade at early steps and, thus, impairs insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Further progress in understanding the role of TNF in adipose tissue was made when endogenous TNF mRNA expression was demonstrated in adipose tissue. Obesity was found to represent a state of overexpression of the TNF system. Such findings support the hypothesis that TNF is a mediator of obesity-linked insulin resistance. However, this concept is mainly based on animal data and is so far only partially supported by studies in humans. Taken together, the results of a variety of experimental and clinical studies suggest that TNF may act as an important auto/paracrine regulator of fat cell function which serves to limit adipose tissue expansion, probably by inducing insulin resistance which may in turn cause metabolic disturbances. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of TNF production and action in adipose tissue may help to find new approaches for the treatment of insulin resistance in humans.",

Importantly, obesity is a leading cause of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. As emerging evidence has shown over the last decade, inflammation is one of the critical processes associated with the development of insulin resistance, diabetes and related diseases, and obesity is now considered as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Adipose tissue, apart from its classical role as an energy storage depot, is also a major endocrine organ secreting many factors, whose local and circulating levels are affected by the degree of adiposity. Obesity leads to infiltration of the expanded adipose tissue by macrophages and increased levels in proinflammatory cytokines. The first indication for increased cytokine release in obesity was provided by the identification of increased expression of TNF-alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine, in the adipose tissue of obese mice in the early 1990s. TNF-alpha is expressed in and secreted by adipose tissue, its levels correlating with the degree of adiposity and the associated insulin resistance. Targeting TNF-alpha and/or its receptors has been suggested as a promising treatment for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This review will summarize the available knowledge on the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and related processes and the potential implications of the above in the development of new therapeutic approaches for obesity and insulin resistance.

The Cognitive Genetics Collaborative Research Organization (COCORO) in Japan promotes neurobiological studies in psychiatry and has successfully replicated and extended works of ENIGMA especially for neuroimaging studies. For example, (a) the ENIGMA consortium showed subcortical regional volume alterations in patients with schizophrenia (n = 2,028) compared to controls (n = 2,540) across 15 cohorts using meta-analysis. COCORO replicated the volumetric changes in patients with schizophrenia (n = 884) compared to controls (n = 1,680) using the ENIGMA imaging analysis protocol and mega-analysis. Furthermore, a schizophrenia-specific leftward asymmetry for the pallidum volume was demonstrated; and (b) the ENIGMA consortium identified white matter microstructural alterations in patients with schizophrenia (n = 1,963) compared to controls (n = 2,359) across 29 cohorts. Using the ENIGMA protocol, a study from COCORO showed similar results in patients with schizophrenia (n = 696) compared to controls (n = 1,506) from 12 sites using mega-analysis.

To overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. However, this introduces heterogeneity due to different scanning devices and sequences. ENIGMA projects commonly address this heterogeneity with random-effects meta-analysis or mixed-effects mega-analysis. Here we tested whether the batch adjustment method, ComBat, can further reduce site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, mixed-effects mega-analyses and ComBat mega-analyses to compare cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes between 2897 individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 3141 healthy controls from 33 sites. Specifically, we compared the imaging data between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, covarying for age and sex. The use of ComBat substantially increased the statistical significance of the findings as compared to random-effects meta-analyses. The findings were more similar when comparing ComBat with mixed-effects mega-analysis, although ComBat still slightly increased the statistical significance. ComBat also showed increased statistical power when we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. Results were nearly identical when we applied the ComBat harmonization separately for cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes. Therefore, we recommend applying the ComBat function to attenuate potential effects of site in ENIGMA projects and other multi-site structural imaging work. We provide easy-to-use functions in R that work even if imaging data are partially missing in some brain regions, and they can be trained with one data set and then applied to another (a requirement for some analyses such as machine learning).",

The largest differences were observed in the corpus callosum and corona radiata. Widespread higher radial diffusivity (RD) was also observed (all Cohen's d between 0.12 and 0.18). Findings appeared to be driven by patients with recurrent MDD and an adult age of onset of depression. White matter microstructural differences in a smaller sample of adolescent MDD patients and controls did not survive correction for multiple testing.

Multi-center brain imaging consortia, such as the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium, are interested in studying disease effects on these subregions, and in the genetic factors that affect them. For large-scale studies, automated extraction and subsequent genomic association studies of these hippocampal subregion measures may provide additional insight. Here, we evaluated the test-retest reliability and transplatform reliability (1.5T versus 3T) of the subregion segmentation module in the FreeSurfer software package using three independent cohorts of healthy adults, one young (Queensland Twins Imaging Study, N=39), another elderly (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI-2, N=163) and another mixed cohort of healthy and depressed participants (Max Planck Institute, MPIP, N=598). We also investigated agreement between the most recent version of this algorithm (v6.0) and an older version (v5.3), again using the ADNI-2 and MPIP cohorts in addition to a sample from the Netherlands Study for Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (N=221). Finally, we estimated the heritability (h(2)) of the segmented subregion volumes using the full sample of young, healthy QTIM twins (N=728). Test-retest reliability was high for all twelve subregions in the 3T ADNI-2 sample (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.70-0.97) and moderate-to-high in the 4T QTIM sample (ICC=0.5-0.89). Transplatform reliability was strong for eleven of the twelve subregions (ICC=0.66-0.96); however, the hippocampal fissure was not consistently reconstructed across 1.5T and 3T field strengths (ICC=0.47-0.57). Between-version agreement was moderate for the hippocampal tail, subiculum and presubiculum (ICC=0.78-0.84; Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)=0.55-0.70), and poor for all other subregions (ICC=0.34-0.81; DSC=0.28-0.51). All hippocampal subregion volumes were highly heritable (h(2)=0.67-0.91).

Cortical thickness and surface area were assessed in MRI scans of 17,141 healthy individuals from 99 datasets worldwide. Results revealed widespread asymmetries at both hemispheric and regional levels, with a generally thicker cortex but smaller surface area in the left hemisphere relative to the right.

These regions are involved in lateralized functions, including language and visuospatial processing. In addition to population-level asymmetries, variability in brain asymmetry was related to sex, age, and intracranial volume.

Here, the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Consortium presents the largest-ever mega-analysis of sex differences in variability of brain structure, based on international data spanning nine decades of life. Subcortical volumes, cortical surface area and cortical thickness were assessed in MRI data of 16,683 healthy individuals 1-90 years old (47% females). We observed significant patterns of greater male than female between-subject variance for all subcortical volumetric measures, all cortical surface area measures, and 60% of cortical thickness measures. This pattern was stable across the lifespan for 50% of the subcortical structures, 70% of the regional area measures, and nearly all regions for thickness. Our findings that these sex differences are present in childhood implicate early life genetic or gene-environment interaction mechanisms. The findings highlight the importance of individual differences within the sexes, that may underpin sex-specific vulnerability to disorders.",

It becomes strategically important that the results can be communicated among brain scientists effectively. Traditional graphs and charts failed to convey the complex shapes of brain structures which are essential to the understanding of the result statistics from the analyses. These problems could be addressed using interactive visualization strategies that can link those statistics with brain structures in order to provide a better interface to understand brain research results. We present ENIGMA-Viewer, an interactive web-based visualization tool for brain scientists to compare statistics such as effect sizes from meta-analysis results on standardized ROIs (regions-of-interest) across multiple studies. The tool incorporates visualization design principles such as focus+context and visual data fusion to enable users to better understand the statistics on brain structures. To demonstrate the usability of the tool, three examples using recent research data are discussed via case studies. ENIGMA-Viewer supports presentations and communications of brain research results through effective visualization designs. By linking visualizations of both statistics and structures, users can gain more insights into the presented data that are otherwise difficult to obtain. ENIGMA-Viewer is an open-source tool, the source code and sample data are publicly accessible through the NITRC website ( http://www.nitrc.org/projects/enigmaviewer_20 ).

It is caused by disruption of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, which pulmonary alveolar macrophages require to clear surfactant. Recently, inhaled GM-CSF was shown to improve the partial pressure of arterial oxygen in patients with aPAP. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-group trial, we randomly assigned patients with aPAP to receive the recombinant GM-CSF molgramostim (300 \u03bcg once daily by inhalation), either continuously or intermittently (every other week), or matching placebo. The 24-week intervention period was followed by an open-label treatment-extension period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen concentration (A-aDo<sub>2</sub>) at week 24. In total, 138 patients underwent randomization; 46 were assigned to receive continuous molgramostim, 45 to receive intermittent molgramostim, and 47 to receive placebo. Invalid A-aDo<sub>2</sub> data for 4 patients (1 in each molgramostim group and 2 in the placebo group) who received nasal oxygen therapy during arterial blood gas measurement were replaced by means of imputation. For the primary end point - the change from baseline in the A-aDo<sub>2</sub> at week 24 - improvement was greater among patients receiving continuous molgramostim than among those receiving placebo (-12.8 mm Hg vs. -6.6 mm Hg; estimated treatment difference, -6.2 mm Hg; P = 0.03 by comparison of least-squares means). Patients receiving continuous molgramostim also had greater improvement than those receiving placebo for secondary end points, including the change from baseline in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score at week 24 (-12.4 points vs. -5.1 points; estimated treatment difference, -7.4 points; P = 0.01 by comparison of least-squares means). For multiple end points, improvement was greater with continuous molgramostim than with intermittent molgramostim. The percentages of patients with adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the three groups, except for the percentage of patients with chest pain, which was higher in the continuous-molgramostim group. In patients with aPAP, daily administration of inhaled molgramostim resulted in greater improvements in pulmonary gas transfer and functional health status than placebo, with similar rates of adverse events.

Studies with purified annexins, as well as overexpression and knockdown approaches identified multiple functions predominantly linked to their dynamic and reversible membrane binding behavior. However, most annexins are found at multiple locations and interact with numerous proteins. Furthermore, similar membrane binding characteristics, overlapping localizations and shared interaction partners have complicated identification of their precise functions. To gain insight into annexin function in vivo, mouse models deficient of annexin A1 (AnxA1), A2, A4, A5, A6 and A7 have been generated. Interestingly, with the exception of one study, all mice strains lacking one or even two annexins are viable and develop normally. This suggested redundancy within annexins, but examining these knockout (KO) strains under stress conditions revealed striking phenotypes, identifying underlying mechanisms specific for individual annexins, often supporting Ca2+ homeostasis and membrane transport as central for annexin biology. Conversely, mice lacking AnxA1 or A2 show extracellular functions relevant in health and disease that appear independent of membrane trafficking or Ca2+ signaling. This review will summarize the mechanistic insights gained from studies utilizing mouse models lacking members of the annexin family.",

Highly conserved annexins may modulate the phagocytic cell removal by acting as bridging molecules to phosphatidylserine, a characteristic phagocytosis signal of dying cells. In this study five members of the structurally and functionally related annexin family were characterized for their capacity to interact with phosphatidylserine and dying cells. The results showed that AnxA3, AnxA4, AnxA13, and the already described interaction partner AnxA5 can bind to phosphatidylserine and apoptotic cells, whereas AnxA8 lacks this ability. Sequence alignment experiments located the essential amino residues for the recognition of surface exposed phosphatidylserine within the calcium binding motifs common to all annexins. These amino acid residues were missing in the evolutionary young AnxA8 and when they were reintroduced by site directed mutagenesis AnxA8 gains the capability to interact with phosphatidylserine containing liposomes and apoptotic cells. By defining the evolutionary conserved amino acid residues mediating phosphatidylserine binding of annexins we show that the recognition of dying cells represent a common feature of most annexins. Hence, the individual annexin repertoire bound to the cell surface of dying cells may fulfil opsonin-like function in cell death recognition.",

The channel hypothesis remained controversial and did not gather sufficient evidence to become accepted. Yet, it continues to draw attention as a framework for interpreting indirect (e.g., biochemical) data. The goal of the mini-review is to examine the data on annexin-lipid interactions from the last ~30 years from the point of view of the controversy between the two lines of inquiry: the well-characterized peripheral assembly of the annexins at membranes vs. their putative transmembrane insertion.

We found that the mRNA expression of Annexin A2 was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. In the loss-of-function of Annexin A2, \u03b2-catenin was indicated to be significantly suppressed and EMT constrained. Moreover, cell proliferation and invasion were both markedly inhibited by the downregulation of Annexin A2. Additionally, the overexpression of \u03b2-catenin obviously reversed the effect of Annexin A2 on EMT, and cell proliferation and invasion, indicating that Annexin A2 suppression regulated EMT through controlling \u03b2-catenin.

The virus remains latent in neurons, and it can reactivate later in life, causing herpes zoster (HZ). Two different vaccines have been developed to prevent HZ; one is based on a live attenuated VZV strain (Zostavax), and the other is based on adjuvanted gE recombinant protein (Shingrix). While Zostavax efficacy wanes with age, Shingrix protection retains its efficacy in elderly subjects (individuals 80 years of age and older). In this context, it is of much interest to understand if there is a role for T cell immunity in the differential clinical outcome and if there is a correlate of protection between T cell immunity and Shingrix efficacy. In this study, we characterized the Shingrix-specific <i>ex vivo</i> CD4 T cell responses in the context of natural exposure and HZ vaccination using pools of predicted epitopes. We show that T cell reactivity following natural infection and Zostavax vaccination dominantly targets nonstructural (NS) proteins, while Shingrix vaccination redirects dominant reactivity to target gE. We mapped the gE-specific responses following Shingrix vaccination to 89 different gE epitopes, 34 of which accounted for 80% of the response. Using antigen presentation assays and single HLA molecule-transfected lines, we experimentally determined HLA restrictions for 94 different donor/peptide combinations. Finally, we used our results as a training set to assess strategies to predict restrictions based on measured or predicted HLA binding and the corresponding HLA types of the responding subjects.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Understanding the T cell profile associated with the protection observed in elderly vaccinees following Shingrix vaccination is relevant to the general definition of correlates of vaccine efficacy. Our study enables these future studies by clarifying the patterns of immunodominance associated with Shingrix vaccination, as opposed to natural infection or Zostavax vaccination. Identification of epitopes recognized by Shingrix-induced CD4 T cells and their associated HLA restrictions enables the generation of tetrameric staining reagents and, more broadly, the capability to characterize the specificity, magnitude, and phenotype of VZV-specific T cells.",

Two HZ vaccines are currently authorized for use in those 50 years of age and older in Canada: a live attenuated zoster vaccine (LZV) authorized in 2008; and a recombinant subunit vaccine (RZV) authorized in October 2017. To review current evidence and develop guidance on whether the previously authorized LZV (Zostavax<sup>\u00ae</sup>) and/or the recently authorized RZV (Shingrix<sup>\u00ae</sup>) vaccine should be offered to Canadians 50 years of age and older: 1) at a population-level, in publicly funded immunization programs; and 2) at an individual-level, to individuals wishing to prevent HZ, or by clinicians wishing to advise individual patients about preventing HZ. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Herpes Zoster Working Group developed a predefined search strategy to identify all eligible studies, assessed their quality, and summarized and analyzed the findings. A Cost Utility Analysis of LZV and RZV was also conducted from a health care system perspective. Recommendations were proposed according to NACI's evidence-based process. The strength of these recommendations was defined, and the Grade of evidence supporting them was identified. In light of the evidence, the recommendations were then considered and approved by NACI. Five recommendations were developed for public health and individual-level decision-making. 1) RZV <i>should be offered</i> to populations/individuals &gt;50 years of age without contraindications (Strong NACI Recommendation, Grade A evidence). 2) RZV <i>should be offered</i> to populations/individuals &gt;50 years of age without contraindications who have previously been vaccinated with LZV (Strong NACI Recommendation, Grade A evidence). Re-immunization with two doses of RZV may be considered one year after LZV (Discretionary NACI Recommendation, Grade I evidence). 3) RZV <i>should be offered</i> to populations/individuals &gt;50 years of age without contraindications who have had a previous episode of HZ (Strong NACI Recommendation, Grade B evidence). Immunization with two doses of RZV may be considered one year after the HZ episode (Discretionary NACI Recommendation, Grade I evidence). 4) LZV <i>may be considered</i> for immunocompetent populations/individuals &gt;50 years of age without contraindications when RZV is contraindicated, unavailable or inaccessible (Discretionary NACI Recommendation, Grade A evidence). 5) RZV (not LZV) <i>may be considered</i> in immunocompromised adults &gt;50 years of age on a case-by-case basis (Discretionary NACI Recommendation, Grade I evidence).

Individuals aged 70-79 years who received ZVL between 1 November 2016 and 31 July 2018 were identified from MedicineInsight. The self-controlled case series (SCCS) method was used to estimate the seasonally-adjusted relative incidence (RI) of seven pre-specified outcome events (injection site reaction (ISR) [positive control], burn [negative control], myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, rash, rash with an antiviral prescription, and clinical attendance) during a plausible post-vaccination at-risk window compared with times distant from vaccination. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of common concomitant vaccinations and restriction to first outcome events. A total of 332,988 vaccination encounters among 150,054 individuals were identified during the study period; over 2 million clinical attendances were observed. There was an increased RI of ISR in the seven days following ZVL (RI = 77.4, 95% CI 48.1-124.6); the RI of clinical attendance (RI = 0.94, 95% CI 0.94-0.95) and stroke (RI = 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.78) were lower in the 42 days following administration of ZVL compared to control periods.

A previously developed health economic model was adapted to the UK setting. Calculations were based on efficacy data from pivotal clinical trials, HZ incidence and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) probability from a UK study and HZ-associated complication rates from published literature. The base-case population considered a 2018-projected UK vaccination cohort of individuals 70 YOA. Vaccination with ZVL or RZV, assuming a first-dose coverage of 48.3% for both vaccines and 70% compliance for the second dose of RZV. Outcomes included reduction of HZ and PHN cases, complications and the use of healthcare resources over a life-time horizon. The impact of coverage and second-dose compliance was also explored. Compared with no vaccination, RZV would lead to a reduction of 30 262 HZ and 5409 PHN cases while ZVL would lead to a reduction of 7909 HZ and 3567 PHN cases. The number needed to vaccinate to prevent 1 HZ case is 12 with RZV and 45 with ZVL. The highest PHI with RZV could be achieved in individuals 60 or 65 YOA.

Among 44,115 patients with the autoimmune diseases, 551 (1.2%) received zoster vaccine, and 761 developed HZ. Zoster vaccine use increased continuously after approval in 2006. Younger and healthier patients, those who had an HZ infection within the past 6 months, and those who were not using anti-TNF therapies were more likely to receive the vaccine. Approximately 6% of vaccinated patients were using anti-TNF therapies at the time of vaccination. The incidence rates of HZ were similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients (standardized incidence ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 3.43). Use of the zoster vaccine was uncommon among older patients with autoimmune diseases, including those not exposed to immunosuppressive medications. The short-term risk of HZ did not appear to be increased in vaccinated patients, even among those using immunosuppressive therapies (for example, biologics) at the time of vaccination.

The authors characterized differences in the immunologic responses induced by two HZ vaccines, the live attenuated zoster vaccine (ZV) and the more recently developed adjuvanted varicella-zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE) subunit herpes zoster vaccine (HZ/su), in vaccine-naive subjects and those previously vaccinated with HZ. The observed differences in responses paralleled the observed clinical protection of the two zoster vaccines, with HZ/su being superior to HZ. Together, these results seem to explain immunologically why the new subunit vaccine outperforms the live vaccine. These differences may also provide clues as to why HZ develops in the first place.",

Zostavax\u00ae was the first vaccine available for the prevention of herpes zoster in older adults. A live-attenuated vaccine, Zostavax is not free of limitations, which include a relatively low efficacy that wanes over time and its contraindication among immunocompromised individuals. The recently available adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine Shingrix\u00ae overcomes some of these limitations. The herpes zoster subunit vaccine is more efficacious than Zostavax, and it can be administered to immunosuppressed individuals. However, the herpes zoster subunit vaccine is considerably costlier and requires a booster injection. In order to clarify the value of each vaccine, de Boer and colleagues compare the cost-effectiveness of no vaccination, and of vaccination with Zostavax or the herpes zoster subunit vaccine in four cohorts of older adults from the perspective of the Netherlands. Whereas neither vaccine was cost-effective under the willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the authors find the herpes zoster subunit vaccine to be cost-effective in some scenarios under a \u20ac50,000 per quality-adjusted life year threshold.Please see related article: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-018-1213-5.",

We also determined the conservation for each intronless gene in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, metazoans, and other eukaryotes. Proportions of intronless genes that are inherited from the common ancestor of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes in these species were consistent with their phylogenetic positions, with more proportions of ancient intronless genes residing in more primitive species. In these species, intronless genes belong to different cellular roles and gene ontology (GO) categories, and some of these functions are very basic. Part of intronless genes is derived from other intronless genes or multiexon genes in each species.

Hexamer composition comparison allowed the definition of over- and under-represented motifs in intronless genes; surprisingly, experimental testing revealed that intron-lacking coding sequences are enriched rather than depleted in elements with splicing enhancement ability.

Intronless genes, which constitute 3 percent of the human genome, differ from intron-containing genes in evolution and function. Our analysis reveals that nucleosome positioning shows a distinct pattern in intronless and intron-containing genes. The nucleosome occupancy upstream of transcription start sites of intronless genes is lower than that of intron-containing genes. In contrast, high occupancy and well positioned nucleosomes are observed along the gene body of intronless genes, which is perfectly consistent with the barrier nucleosome model. Intronless genes have a significantly lower expression level than intron-containing genes and most of them are not expressed in CD4+ T cell lines and GM12878 cell lines, which results from their tissue specificity. However, the highly expressed genes are at the same expression level between the two types of genes.

These SEGs encode for a variety of family proteins including claudins, olfactory receptors and histones that are essential for various biological functions. Subsequently, we predicted and annotated SEGs in three European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax chromosomes that we have sequenced, and compared results with those of stickleback (G. aculeatus) homologous chromosomes. While the annotation features of three D. labrax chromosomes revealed 78 (5.30%) intronless genes, comparisons with G. aculeatus showed that SEG composition and their order varied significantly among corresponding chromosomes, even for those with nearly complete synteny. More than half of SEGs identified in most of the species have at least one ortholog multiple exon gene in the same genome, which provides insight to their possible origin by retrotransposition. In spite of the fact that they belong to the same lineage, the fraction of predicted SEGs varied significantly between the genomes analyzed, and only a low fraction of proteins (4.1%) is conserved between all five species. Furthermore, the inter-specific distribution of SEGs as well as the functional categories shared by species did not reflect their phylogenetic relationships. These results indicate that new SEGs are continuously and independently generated after species divergence over evolutionary time as evidenced by the phylogenetic results of single exon claudins genes. Although the origin of SEGs cannot be inferred directly from the phylogeny, our results provide strong support for the idea that retrotransposition followed by tandem duplications is the most probable event that can explain the expansion of SEGs in eukaryotic organisms.",

Functional analysis of IGs has revealed a massive over-representation of signal transduction genes and genes encoding regulatory proteins important for growth, proliferation, and development. IGs also often display tissue-specific expression, usually in the nervous system and testis. These characteristics translate into IG-associated diseases, mainly neuropathies, developmental disorders, and cancer. IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality. Processing, nuclear export, and translation of these mRNAs should be hampered dramatically by the lack of splice factors, which normally tightly cover mature transcripts and govern their fate.

We report here the identification and characterization of the Makorin ring finger protein 1 gene (MKRN1), a highly transcribed, intron-containing source for this family of genes. Phylogenetic analyses clearly indicate that the MKRN1 gene is the ancestral founder of this gene family. We have identified MKRN1 orthologs from human, mouse, wallaby, chicken, fruitfly, and nematode, underscoring the age and conservation of this gene. The MKRN gene family encodes putative ribonucleoproteins with a distinctive array of zinc-finger motifs, including two to four C(3)H zinc-fingers, an unusual Cys/His arrangement that may represent a novel zinc-finger structure, and a highly conserved RING zinc-finger. To date, we have identified nine MKRN family loci distributed throughout the human genome. The human and mouse MKRN1 loci map to a conserved syntenic group near the T-cell receptor beta cluster (TCRB) in chromosome 7q34-q35 and chromosome 6A, respectively. MKRN1 is widely transcribed in mammals, with high levels in murine embryonic nervous system and adult testis.

We have examined in silico the structure of rho (which is expressed uniquely in the retina) and the closely related extraretinal rod-like opsin (exo-rhodopsin) gene, errlo (which is expressed uniquely in the pineal), in the puffer-fish, Fugu rubripes (Takifugu rubripes). Whilst the ocular rho is intronless in common with other Teleosts, the pineal errlo has the five exon/four intron structure common to the rod opsin gene of other vertebraes. A comparison of the sequence surrounding the errlo and rho loci indicates that the errlo locus is syntenic with RHO, the human rod opsin gene, rather than rho. We suggest that the intronless rho may have arisen through an ancient retrotransposition of a mature mRNA originating from errlo. This duplication event has occurred early in the evolution of the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) since the rho of the primitive Actinopterygians such as sturgeon, bowfin, and gar is also intronless. Since it appears that the intron containing errlo is the ancestral opsin gene that gave rise to the intronless rho in the Teleostei, errlo is therefore the true orthologue of the rod opsin gene in other vertebrate classes. We suggest that loss of expression of errlo in the retina could be related to the metabolic and physiological advantages, such as a reduction in splicing events during RNA processing, that may be conferred through possession of an additional, intronless rod opsin gene in the form of rho.",

To investigate the role of STING during KSHV infection of primary ECs we identified a primary lymphatic EC sample that is defective for STING activation and we also knocked out STING in blood ECs. Ablation of STING in EC does not increase susceptibility to KSHV latent infection nor does it increase KSHV spread after lytic reactivation indicating STING signaling does not restrict KSHV.

Cells recognize virus infection through pattern recognition receptors and induce type I interferons as well as proinflammatory cytokines to orchestrate an innate immune response. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) triggers both the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathways. It is well known that TLR3 uses the adaptor protein Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) domain-containing adaptor-inducing beta interferon (TRIF) for signaling, but we recently reported that STING signaling also requires TRIF. Because STING directly binds to TRIF, we identified the STING-interacting domain of TRIF and generated STING-noninteracting mutants of human and mouse TRIFs. The mutant TRIFs were unable to support STING signaling, although they were fully functional in the TLR3 pathway. These mutants were used to assess the relative contributions of the TLR3 and STING pathways to the attenuation of HSV-1 replication in mouse and human cell lines. For this purpose, the mouse L929 and NB41A3 cell lines and the human HT1080 and HeLa-M cell lines, in which both the TLR3 and the STING pathways are operational, were used. The TRIF gene was disrupted in these lines by CRISPR/Cas9, before reconstituting them with mutant and wild-type TRIF expression vectors. Infection of the reconstituted cells with HSV-1 revealed that both the cGAS-STING and the TLR3 signaling pathways are required for the attenuation of virus replication, but their relative contributions in attenuating HSV-1 replication were found to be different in mouse versus human cell lines. Thus, our study suggests that the relative contributions of the cGAS-STING and the TLR3 pathways in the attenuation of viral infection may be species specific.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The magnitude of fatal infections caused by all different viruses in human and animal populations justifies a better understanding of the host innate immune response process that attenuates virus replication. In particular, the relative contributions of different signaling pathways which are responsible for the generation of the innate immune response are still largely unknown. In this study, we used STING-noninteracting TRIF mutants to decipher the relative contributions of the TLR3 and cGAS-STING signaling pathways to the attenuation of HSV-1 infection. We show that the relative contributions of the two pathways to the attenuation of viral infection are different in mouse versus human cell lines. Together, our results provide new insights into the relative contributions of two different signaling pathways in the attenuation of viral infection and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies aimed at blocking viral infection at very early stages.",

The 293T human cells are widely used in biology studies as they are highly transfectable. While parental 293 cells express high levels of STING, 293T cells lack STING and are unable to induce interferon antiviral responses to cytosolic DNA. Additionally, 293T cells express the SV40 polyomavirus large T antigen (LT) which enhances the replication of transfected DNA plasmids carrying the SV40 origin of replication. Since SV40 LT also encodes the LxCxE motif, the lack of STING expression in 293T cells is commonly assumed to be due to SV40 large T antigen. We find that SV40 LT does not alter exogenously expressed and endogenous levels of STING protein. We show that STING transcription is suppressed in 293T cells but is not driven by SV40. This study also revealed that SV40 LT does indeed inhibit cGAS-STING interferon induction, but through a mechanism distinct from other DNA virus oncogenes.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29696193": " Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) is a promising minimal-invasive treatment option for early liver cancer, however monitoring or predicting the size of the resulting tissue necrosis during the RFA-procedure is a challenging task, potentially resulting in a significant rate of under- or over treatments. Currently there is no reliable lesion size prediction method commercially available. ClinicIMPPACT is designed as multicenter-, prospective-, non-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of innovative planning and simulation software. 60 patients with early liver cancer will be included at four European clinical institutions and treated with the same RFA system. The preinterventional imaging datasets will be used for computational planning of the RFA treatment. All ablations will be simulated simultaneously to the actual RFA procedure, using the software environment developed in this project. The primary outcome measure is the comparison of the simulated ablation zones with the true lesions shown in follow-up imaging after one month, to assess accuracy of the lesion prediction. This unique multicenter clinical trial aims at the clinical integration of a dedicated software solution to accurately predict lesion size and shape after radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors. Accelerated and optimized workflow integration, and real-time intraoperative image processing, as well as inclusion of patient specific information, e.g. organ perfusion and registration of the real RFA needle position might make the introduced software a powerful tool for interventional radiologists to optimize patient outcomes.",

The natural histological course of untreated BE is non-dysplastic or benign BE (ND), then lowgrade (LGD) and High-Grade Dysplastic (HGD) BE, with the expected increase in malignancy transfer to oesophagal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The gold standard for BE diagnostics involves high-resolution white-light endoscopy, followed by uniform endoscopy findings description (Prague classification) with biopsy performance according to Seattle protocol. The medical treatment of GERD and BE includes the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) regarding symptoms control. It is noteworthy that long-term use of PPIs increases gastrin level, which can contribute to transfer from BE to EAC, as a result of its effects on the proliferation of BE epithelium. Endoscopy treatment includes a wide range of resection and ablative techniques, such as radio-frequency ablation (RFA), often concomitantly used in everyday endoscopy practice (multimodal therapy). RFA promotes mucosal necrosis of treated oesophagal region via high-frequency energy. Laparoscopic surgery, partial or total fundoplication, is reserved for PPIs and endoscopy indolent patients or in those with progressive disease. This review aims to explain distinct effects of PPIs and RFA modalities, illuminate certain aspects of molecular mechanisms involved, as well as the effects of their concomitant use regarding the treatment of BE and prevention of its transfer to EAC.",

Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radio frequency ablation (RFA) in reducing clinical symptoms, fibroid volume and improving laboratory parameters. Thirty-five symptomatic patients with 54 uterine fibroids were enrolled. Preintervention evaluation was made for each participant and included ultrasonography to assess the volume, largest diameter and location of the fibroid and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for quantifying the degree of menstrual pain. The magnitude of menstrual bleeding was scored for each patient by using pictogram. Preprocedural laboratory assessment included hemoglobulin and hematocrit. Treatment efficacy was evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months after the intervention with ultrasound (US) measurements, symptom scores and laboratory parameters. Pretreatment mean Hb was significantly lower than those at 3, 6 and 12 month post treatment visits (p &lt; 0.001). The pretreatment median volume was significantly higher than the median volumes measured at 3, 6 and 12 months after RFA (p &lt; 0.001). Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for pain was significantly lower than baseline values at 6 and 12 month visits (p &lt; 0.01). Pretreatment bleeding scores and the number of patients in the predefined severe bleeding category were significantly decreased. US guided RF ablation of uterine fibroids is relatively safe and effective procedure. It can be applied to the fibroids with varying localizations and sizes. It reduces the fibroid volume and obviate a need for more invasive treatment.",

The traditional treatment algorithm progresses from conservative modalities to nonsurgical options to surgical intervention. Surgical intervention often provides reliable pain relief but not all patients are surgical candidates and there are some patients who prefer not to have surgery. Cooled radio frequency ablation (C-RFA) is a treatment with the potential to provide pain relief for patients who no longer benefit from noninvasive modalities and who desire an alternative to surgery. The objective of this review article is to provide the rationale, available evidence, indications, and outcomes associated with C-RFA for the treatment of chronic knee OA. A total of eight reports that use C-RFA in the treatment of chronic knee pain were identified and analyzed. There were two prospective trials, one retrospective cohort study, and five case reports or case series. C-RFA is an emerging procedure with encouraging early results; however, additional long-term prospective clinical trials are necessary to further characterize how C-RFA can best be used to treat chronic knee pain.",

Additionally, the use of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be used in the management of chronic peripheral nerve pain. Previous studies investigating the effectiveness of RFA and PRF, typically case reports, have demonstrated that peripheral nerve RFA and PRF have the potential to provide relief of chronic pain for long duration. Our study aimed at testing efficacy of RFA/PRF for treating peripheral neuralgia. This was a retrospective review. We identified 16 patients who received 17 RFAs/PRFs. Outcomes of interest collected included pain scores before and after procedures, percent improvement in pain after each procedure, and duration of improvement until the time of data collection. In addition, demographic data including age, sex, and nerves involved were collected. Eleven patients (12 RFAs/PRFs) (80%) reported improvement after their procedure. Pain scores improved significantly from 6.3 \u00b1 2.3 before each procedure to 3.6 \u00b1 2.7 after each procedure (p = 0.003). Eleven patients (12 RFAs/PRFs) reported an average improvement of 60.8% \u00b1 35% after their procedure with an average duration of improvement of 128.8 \u00b1 106.8 days. RFA and PRF can be used to treat chronic peripheral pain after conservative methods fail to do so. Large clinical trials are needed to confirm our finding.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065438": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an important standard therapy for cardiac arrhythmias, but direct monitoring of tissue treatment is currently lacking. We demonstrate an RFA catheter integrated with polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography (PSOCT) for directly monitoring the RFA process in real time. The integrated RFA/OCT catheter was modified from a standard clinical RFA catheter and includes a miniature forward-viewing cone-scanning OCT probe. The PSOCT system was validated with a quarter-wave plate while the RFA function of the integrated catheter was validated by comparing lesion sizes with those made with an unmodified RFA catheter. Additionally, the integrated catheter guided catheter-tissue apposition and monitored RFA lesion formation in cardiac tissue in real time. The results show that catheter-tissue contact can be characterized by observing the features of the blood and tissue in the acquired OCT images and that RFA lesion formation can be confirmed by monitoring the change in phase retardance in the acquired PSOCT images. This system demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated RFA/OCT catheter to deliver RF energy and image the cardiac wall simultaneously and justifies further research into use of this technology to aid RFA therapy for cardiac arrhythmias.",

Radio frequency thermal ablation was performed on 7 patients with unresectable recurrent retroperitoneal or pelvic tumors from colorectal (n = 4), renal (n = 2), and prostate (n = 1) cancers. Under sonographic guidance, a total of 11 radio frequency thermal ablation operations were performed by a percutaneous or transanal approach. Three patients were asymptomatic, whereas 4 patients were symptomatic. The sizes of the tumors ranged from 29 to 100 mm (mean, 50.5 mm). Radio frequency thermal ablation was technically completed in all operations without intraoperative complications. The ablation time ranged from 25 to 238 minutes depending on the tumor size. There was no mortality. There were postoperative complications in 3 operations (27.3%): an enterovesical fistula, a skin burn, and fecal incontinence. The hospital stay was generally 0 to 1 day. Tumor marker levels decreased after radio frequency thermal ablation in all operations. Symptoms of 4 patients were controlled by radio frequency thermal ablation. One patient with recurrent renal cancer and uncontrollable hypercalcemia became asymptomatic immediately after radio frequency thermal ablation. Local recurrence at the radio frequency thermal ablation site occurred in 2 patients (28.6%), but these local recurrent tumors were treated effectively by additional sonographically guided radio frequency thermal ablation. Minimally invasive sonographically guided radio frequency thermal ablation is technically feasible for local treatment of unresectable recurrent retroperitoneal and pelvic tumors from different origins. Care should be taken to avoid thermal injury to surrounding organs. Further study is needed to evaluate its safety and efficacy.",

Some have questioned the completeness of cell death and the reliability of axial imaging for radio frequency ablation followup. We present results in patients with no evidence of radiographic active disease who underwent biopsy more than 1 year following ablation. Patients who had no clinical evidence of disease, defined as absent lesion growth and contrast enhancement on computerized tomography, 1 year or more following radio frequency ablation underwent percutaneous renal biopsy to evaluate cell viability in the ablative zone. A total of 19 patients (20 lesions) were included in the study. Histological comparison of pre-ablation and post-ablation specimens was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Pre-ablation biopsies confirmed that 17 of 20 tumors were renal cell carcinoma, while the remaining 3 were oncocytoma. Following ablation at a mean followup of 26.9 months (range 13.1 to 58.0) all 20 lesions were stable in size without evidence of contrast enhancement on computerized tomography. At repeat biopsy all histology specimens showed unequivocal tumor eradication with no evidence of cellular viability. Histological changes beyond 1 year demonstrated coagulative necrosis, hyalinization, inflammatory cell infiltration and residual ghost cells. Pathological examination of radiographically negative lesions biopsied more than 1 year following radio frequency ablation confirmed no evidence of disease in all specimens. Therefore, axial imaging can reliably monitor treatment efficacy in the long term. Chronic changes after radio frequency ablation demonstrate coagulative necrosis and nonviable cells. This suggests an evolution of pathological changes that renders early post-ablative biopsy unreliable.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22335865": " Renal tumor size influences the efficacy of radio frequency ablation but identification of confident size cutoffs has been limited by small numbers and short followup. We evaluated tumor size related outcomes after radio frequency ablation for patients with adequate (greater than 3 years) followup. We identified 159 tumors treated with radio frequency ablation as primary treatment. Disease-free survival was defined as the time from definitive treatment to local recurrence, detection of metastasis or the most recent imaging showing no evidence of disease. Patients were evaluated with contrast enhancing imaging preoperatively, and at 6 weeks, 6 months and at least annually thereafter. Median tumor size was 2.4 cm (range 0.9 to 5.4) with a median followup of 54 months (range 1.5 to 120). Renal cell carcinoma was confirmed in 72% of the 150 tumors that had pre-ablation biopsy (94%). The 3 and 5-year disease-free survival was comparable at 92% and 91% overall, and was dependent on tumor size, being 96% and 95% for tumors smaller than 3.0 cm and 79% and 79%, respectively, for tumors 3 cm or larger (p=0.001). Most failures (14 of 18) were local, either incomplete ablations or local recurrences. This is an intent to treat analysis and, therefore, includes patients ultimately found to have benign tumors, although outcomes were comparable in patients with cancer. Radio frequency ablation treatment success of the small renal mass is strongly correlated with tumor size. Radio frequency ablation provides excellent and durable outcomes, particularly in tumors smaller than 3 cm. Of tumors 3 cm or larger, approximately 20% will recur such that alternative treatment techniques should be considered. However, most treatment failures are local and are often successfully treated with another ablation session.",

Fourteen lesions in 12 patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors were treated with this technique and followed for up to 10 months. The stereotactic coordinates of the tumor and the angle of the radio frequency probe were calculated on MR imaging. The radio frequency lesion was generated in the awake patient by increasing the temperature to 80 degrees C within the tumor for 1 minute. This was repeated until the entire tumor volume was destroyed. MR imaging was performed before, during, and immediately after the radio frequency procedure, and sequential MR was obtained during clinical follow-up. MR imaging clearly showed well-defined radio frequency lesions and provided feedback for treatment planning. The radio frequency lesion boundary was well identified as a dark signal rim on T2-weighted images and showed ring enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The sequential MR imaging showed the radio frequency lesions decreased in volume in all cases, suggesting focal control. Stereotactic MR-guided radio frequency brain tumor ablation is a feasible and promising technique that can be an attractive brain tumor treatment alternative. MR provided not only accurate tumor location but also visualization of feedback of thermal tissue changes that reflected therapeutic effect.",

Current curative treatment options are limited to esophagectomy, a procedure that suffers from high complication rates and high mortality rates. Metaplasia of the esophageal epithelium, a condition known as Barrett's esophagus (BE), is widely accepted as the precursor lesion for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Recently, radio-frequency ablation has been shown to be an effective method to treat BE, although there is disagreement as to whether radio-frequency ablation should be used to treat all patients with BE or whether treatment should be reserved for those at high risk for progressing to esophageal adenocarcinoma while continuing to endoscopically survey those with low risk. Recent research has been targeted towards identifying those at greater risk for progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma so that radio-frequency ablation therapy can be used in a more targeted manner, decreasing the total health care cost as well as improving patient outcomes. This review discusses the current state of the literature regarding risk factors for progression from BE through dysplasia to esophageal adenocarcinoma, as well as the current need for an integrated scoring tool or risk stratification system capable of differentiating those patients at highest risk of progression in order to target these endoluminal therapies.",

Novel strategies of active immunotherapy could be more effective in patients with less advanced disease who receive standard therapies supporting concomitant stimulation of the immune system. Radio-Frequency Ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique which is used as standard local therapy of primary and metastatic liver tumors. Tumor ablation by RFA induces effects important for boosting anti-tumor immune responses. Tumor cell necrosis generates a permanent immunogenic source of tumor antigens. These antigens can be uptaken, processed and presented by dendritic cells for effective immunization without requirement for ex vivo antigen loading. Further immune activation can be originated by RFA through induction of heat shock proteins on tumor cells, acute phase response which causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and mobilization of antigen presenting cells and effector lymphocytes. Thus, RFA can facilitate immune responses to tumor antigens driven by active immunotherapy. On the other hand, immunotherapy is expected to eradicate residual disease after RFA and prevent tumor recurrences. The combination of RFA and active immunotherapy may well have synergistic effects for cancer treatment.",

Cardiac deformations imaged at high temporal and spatial resolution can be used to elucidate the electrical activation sequence in normal and paced human subjects non-invasively and could potentially aid to better plan and monitor ablation-based arrhythmia treatments. In this study, a novel ultrasound-based method is presented that can be used to quantitatively characterize focal and reentrant arrhythmias. Spatio-temporal maps of the full-view of the atrial and ventricular mechanics were obtained in a single heartbeat, revealing with otherwise unobtainable detail the electromechanical patterns of atrial flutter, fibrillation, and tachycardia in humans. During focal arrhythmias such as premature ventricular complex and focal atrial tachycardia, the previously developed electromechanical wave imaging methodology is hereby shown capable of identifying the location of the focal zone and the subsequent propagation of cardiac activation. During reentrant arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, Fourier analysis of the strains revealed highly correlated mechanical and electrical cycle lengths and propagation patterns. High frame rate ultrasound imaging of the heart can be used non-invasively and in real time, to characterize the lesser-known mechanical aspects of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, also potentially assisting treatment planning for intraoperative and longitudinal monitoring of arrhythmias.",

This study evaluates bone cement deposition patterns and extravasation in treated vertebral bodies in relation to the metastatic lesion after using this combined approach. Retrospective assessments of CT images performed before/after the procedures were evaluated in 37 patients (44 levels) with advanced metastatic lesions. A void was created in the anterior portion of the tumor-infiltrated vertebral body by using a bipolar plasma-mediated radio-frequency-based wand, followed by deposition of bone cement. Pain measured by visual analog scale score was recorded preprocedure and 2-4 weeks afterward. In 19 (43%) levels, 90%-100% of the cement was deposited in the anterior two thirds of the vertebral body. In 34 levels (77%), 75% or more of the cement was deposited in the anterior two thirds of the vertebral body. In 13/15 (86%) levels with posterior lesions, cement was deposited anterior to the lesion. No extravasation was observed in 13 levels (29.5%). Two clinically insignificant incidences of epidural extravasation were noted. Pain relief after the procedure was reported by 25/28 (89.5%) patients with available data. pmRF ablation may allow greater cement-deposition control, increasing the likelihood of successfully stabilizing the anterior two thirds of the vertebral body. This combined technique appeared particularly useful in cases with posteriorly located lesions. The incidence of cement extravasation was relatively high but clinically insignificant.",

RFA is one kinds of thermal therapy. However, it has been often reported about excessive ablation or non-ablation due to difficult control of ablation energy. In order to solve these difficulties, we have been proposed robotized RF-ablation system for precise cancer treatment. We have been tried to control heat energy by control of electromagnetic-wave frequency. In this paper, we reported about relation among electrical impedance of lung, lung's internal air volumes, and heat energy by use of electromagnetic-wave. In case of RFA for lung cancer, heat energy depends on electrical impedance and lung's internal air volumes. Electrical impedance has the dependence of electromagnetic-wave frequency and the dependence of lung's internal air volumes. Therefore, firstly we considered about fractional calculus model between lung's internal air volumes and electrical impedance. Secondly, we measured electric impedance frequency characteristic of lung with change of lung's internal air volumes. The measured and modeled results showed that use of fractional calculus realized high accurate model for electrical impedance of lung. And, from the results of numerical analysis of heat energy, it is supposed that control of electromagnetic-wave frequency has a small effectiveness for lung tissue ablation even if lung includes abundant air.",

We report the efficacy of RFA for nine carefully selected patients with RCC who had significant reason to avoid invasive surgical treatment under general anesthesia. Radio-frequency ablation was performed under epidural or local anesthesia by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) guidance in nine patients with biopsy proven RCC (mean diameter, 38 mm; range, 20-53 mm), who were at significant operative or anesthetic risk for invasive surgery. Follow-up enhanced CT scans or magnetic resonance images were evaluated every 3-6 months and an evaluation of metastasis was performed every 6 months. At a mean follow-up of 17 months, seven (78%) of the nine patients with renal tumor showed no tumor enhancement. The renal function of all patients was well preserved. All patients were able to continue undergoing their respective treatments for active diseases in other organs in parallel to the RFA treatment. No distant metastasis, urine leakage were reported and one case of temporary hematuria and one case of peri-renal hemorrhage not requiring blood transfusion were encountered. Intra-operative ultrasonography was useful in the real-time monitoring of the minimally excessive extension of ablation into the normal parenchyma.

The tumor was then excised via radical or partial nephrectomy. Gross and histological evaluations of the tumor were performed, including evaluation with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide vital staining. All 10 tumors were confirmed histologically to be renal cell carcinoma. Mean tumor size was 3.2 cm. (range 1.4 to 8.0). Of the 10 tumors 8 were completely ablated with a mean treatment margin of 6.75 mm. (range 2 to 13). Of the 2 tumors that were incompletely treated 1 never attained a temperature sufficient for tissue destruction and the other measured 8 cm., far exceeding the expected ablation volume of treatment protocol.

All patients were followed for at least 12 months. Patients in the laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted tumor enucleation group underwent tumor enucleation after radio frequency ablation without hilar clamping. The primary outcome was the change in glomerular filtration rate of the affected kidney by renal scintigraphy at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate, estimated blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, postoperative complications and oncologic outcomes. The Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact, Student t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used. The trial ultimately enrolled 89 patients, of whom 44 were randomized to the laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted tumor enucleation group and 45 to the laparoscopic partial nephrectomy group. In the laparoscopic partial nephrectomy group 1 case was converted to radical nephrectomy. Compared with the laparoscopic partial nephrectomy group, patients in the laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted tumor enucleation group had a smaller decrease in glomerular filtration rate of the affected kidney at 3 months (10.2% vs 20.5%, p=0.001) and 12 months (7.6% vs 16.2%, p=0.002).

Cryoablation performed laparoscopically or percutaneously offers excellent oncological outcomes with single-session therapy. With 3-year cancer-specific survival of 98%, laparoscopic cryoablation is safe and can be performed with minimal insult to overall renal function. Local recurrence rates and metastatic progression also seem to favor cryoablation over radio frequency ablation (4.6 vs. 11.7% and 1.2 vs. 2.3%, respectively). Radio frequency ablation also offers similar survival rates; however, re-treatment rates are higher (8.8%). Radio frequency ablation also carries a higher rate of collecting system injuries when performed percutaneously. Cryoablation and radio frequency ablation are effective treatment modalities for small renal masses in the infirm patient. Given patient and technical variability, superiority of either radio frequency ablation or cryoablation cannot be confirmed based on available literature. However, there is a trend towards higher recurrence and re-treatment rates after radio frequency ablation.",

The development of nonsurgical treatment modalities would greatly improve quality of life in these patients. We present our experience with radio frequency interstitial tissue ablation, a heating device approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating soft tissue tumors. Patients underwent radio frequency interstitial tissue ablation of small renal tumors just before surgical excision. Pathological examination of the renal tumors was done to evaluate the treatment effect. Computerized tomography and renal function testing were performed before and after therapy to evaluate toxicity. Four patients underwent treatment of a total of 14 tumors with the radio frequency interstitial tissue ablation device just before surgical removal of the tumors. All lesions were brown after ablation, in contrast to the normal pink appearance of untreated lesions that were resected. On color Doppler ultrasound blood flow to each tumor evident before was not visualized after treatment. The Wilcoxon rank sum test demonstrated no difference preoperatively and postoperatively in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance or differential renal function. We identified no toxicity associated with radio frequency interstitial tissue ablation. Of the excised tumors 11 were renal cell carcinoma and 3 fibrotic hemorrhagic cysts. For renal cell carcinoma the treatment effect involved the loss of nuclear detail and nonvisualization of nucleoli. These changes were not observed in any tumors resected without radio frequency interstitial tissue ablation. The treatment effect was noted in 10 of the 11 lesions, and in 1 case the treatment effect involved 35% of the tumor. No toxicity was associated with radio frequency interstitial tissue ablation. Percutaneous treatment of renal tumors is planned to evaluate the treatment effect better and further evaluate toxicity.",

Renal cell carcinoma treatment, which must prevent metastatic disease and spare nephrons, has changed in the last 2 decades. We evaluated renal cell carcinoma treatments in the long term in a large series of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. We retrospectively evaluated the use and results of surgery and radio frequency ablation in patients with von Hippel-Lindau followed at our institution between 1988 and 2009. Renal anatomical survival was analyzed according to 3 periods, including 1) 1988 to 1994--the learning phase of nephron sparing surgery, 2) 1995 to 2003--routine nephron sparing surgery and 3) 2004 to 2009--the emergence of radio frequency ablation. A first renal cell carcinoma was treated at a mean age of 38 years (range 15 to 67) in 113 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. During a median followup of 7.2 years 251 therapeutic procedures were performed in a total of 176 kidneys. We observed a shift of first line renal cell carcinoma treatment with time, that is nephrectomy in 52% of cases in period 1, tumorectomy in 75% in period 2 and radio frequency ablation in 43% in period 3. The shift paralleled improved renal survival. While nephron sparing surgery was primarily done for lesions greater than 30 mm, radio frequency ablation was used to treat less numerous and smaller ipsilateral lesions but they required more frequent intervention. Radio frequency ablation became the most widely used second or third line procedure and allowed renal salvage in 8 patients. Nephron sparing surgery and more recently radio frequency ablation enable earlier treatment of smaller tumors and are associated with a significant improved renal prognosis in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.",

We treated 15 patients with a total of 20 tumors with radio frequency ablation through an open surgical approach immediately before partial nephrectomy. All tumors were biopsied before radio frequency ablation treatment. Tumors were heated to 90 to 110C for 6 to 16 minutes (mean 9.1). Tumor ablation was monitored by direct vision and ultrasound. Partial nephrectomy was performed in standard fashion. All specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and 5 specimens were stained for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) diaphorase activity. Tumors ranged from 1.5 to 3.5 cm. (mean 2.4) in greatest dimension. All 20 specimens had evidence of morphologically unchanged tumor and normal renal parenchyma on standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. Of the 5 specimens 4 stained positively for NADH in areas confirmed to be tumor in hematoxylin and eosin stained neighboring sections. There was 1 intraoperative renal pelvic thermal injury requiring pyeloplasty and 2 postoperative caliceal leaks requiring stent placement. In our series radio frequency therapy did not result in total tumor destruction when specimens were examined with hematoxylin and eosin or NADH staining. We believe that radio frequency interstitial tumor ablation of renal cell carcinoma without subsequent tissue resection should continue to be an investigational treatment modality for those who would otherwise undergo partial or radical nephrectomy.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7944863": "Atrial arrhythmias resistant to medical therapy are still a common indication for ablation of the normal atrioventricular conduction pathway (Tawara node and His Bundle). However, the development of catheter techniques of intra-atrial ablation to destroy arrhythmogenic myocardial zones enables radical cure of the arrhythmias with the respect of the nodo-hisian pathway. With respect to common flutter, a number of series, including our own, show a 50 to 75% long-term success rate. We believe that a very high success rate in the ablation of flutter will probably be achieved in a reproducible manner but this will require a more accurate understanding of the tachycardia circuit and technological developments allowing controlled radio-frequency destruction of bigger atrial myocardial zone. Experience of radio-frequency ablation atrial of atrial extrasystoles is more limited than that of flutter and there are fewer published series. Globally, catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia remains a more difficult and a less well codified procedure than that of accessory pathways or of intra-nodal reentry. Radio-frequency ablation in this indication is not without danger in view of the thinness of the atrial wall. We believe that radio-frequency catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias should, for the moment, be reserved for centres specialised in the techniques of electro-physiological investigation and ablation.",

From January 2000 to January 2001 we performed 16 radio-frequency ablations in 15 patients. All candidates for treatment had previously undergone clinical and radiologic examinations to confirm features typical of osteoid osteoma. After administration of spinal anesthetic, procedures were performed with CT-guidance, using a Kirschner wire introduced into the localized lesion, and a guiding cannula. A hole was first cut into the bone with a cutter, then a few biopsy specimens were obtained with a Jamshidi needle. Finally, we introduced a small radio-frequency electrode into the bone, through the biopsy track. Sufficient current was used to heat the electrode tip to 85-90 degrees C with consequent thermal necrosis of the tissue. The healing was continued for 6 minutes. All patients well tolerated the percutaneous procedure and only 1 underwent a second, successful radio-frequency ablation. In all cases, pain relief was noted to occur very rapidly and all patients could bear full weight on the treated extremity within 24 hours after the procedure. No late complications attributable to the ablation were noted, except for a small eschar next to the puncture site. The results of the present study suggest that percutaneous ablation is preferred to operative excision because it generally requires shorter hospital stay and is not associated with complications. Furthermore, in our experience, pain relief was noted to occur very rapidly in 100% of cases. In agreement with the literature data, our results show that CT-guided percutaneous radio-frequency ablation can actually replace operative excision in the treatment of osteoid osteoma as it achieves the same clinical outcomes with significantly lower costs.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1417404": "Catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction may be proposed for the treatment of certain atrial arrhythmias resistant to antiarrhythmic therapy. One of the methods currently being evaluated uses radio-frequency energy which has certain advantages compared with direct current ablation because of the progressive and limited lesions it produces. This technique was used in 24 patients with atrial arrhythmias resistant to antiarrhythmic therapy. The radio-frequency energy was delivered without general anaesthesia with HAT 100 and 200 (OSYPKA) generators in the unipolar mode (average 17.4 watts) for an average period of 22.3 +/- 8 seconds. The catheter (8F USCI suction catheter in the first 18 patients and a 7F Polaris Mansfield, deflectable catheter with a large distal electrode in the remainder) was positioned at the nodo-hisian junction at a point where the two distal electrodes recorded a large atrial deflection and the smallest possible hisian potential. The conduction defects induced during the acute phase generally remain stable in cases of complete atrioventricular block and tend to regress in cases of incomplete atrioventricular block despite initial control of atrioventricular conduction. During follow-up (21 +/- 16 months), 14 patients (58%) remained in complete atrioventricular block, 4 patients (17%) had controlled atrioventricular conduction with an acceptable ventricular rate with associated previously ineffective antiarrhythmic therapy. Radio-frequency ablation was a failure in 6 patients (25%). There were no haemodynamic, rhythmic or ischaemic complications during the acute phase or during follow-up. These results suggest radio-frequency energy is a seductive alternative to direct current ablation for percutaneous modification of atrioventricular conduction in patients with refractory atrial arrhythmias. However, simple modulation of atrioventricular conduction gives aleatory results due to the tendency to regression during follow-up. On the other hand, complete atrioventricular blocks created by radio-frequency energy are generally definitive and are associated with a junctional escape rhythm which is usually stable.",

We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who underwent radio frequency ablation or nephrectomy between February 2006 and December 2010. Radiographic followup with contrast imaging was performed 7 days, 3 and 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter after radio frequency ablation sequentially. The followup protocol for partial nephrectomy was every 6 months in the initial 3 years and annually thereafter. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, which were compared with the log rank test. Multivariable regression analysis was done to determine predictors of survival. A total of 56 patients who met selection criteria were included in study. Patients in the radio frequency ablation group had relatively higher mean age and a higher mean ASA\u00ae score than those in the partial nephrectomy group. Mean tumor diameter was significantly larger in the partial nephrectomy cohort. For radio frequency ablation vs partial nephrectomy 5-year overall, cancer specific and disease-free survival was 85.5% (95% CI 72.2-98.8) vs 96.6% (95% CI 95.9-97.3), 92.6% (95% CI 82.4-98.1) vs 96.6% (95% CI 95.9-97.3) and 81.0% (95% CI 66.2-95.8) vs 89.7% (95% CI 78.5-97.9), respectively. The percent decrease in the glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in the radio frequency ablation group at early and last followup. In appropriately selected patients with stage cT1b renal cell carcinoma radio frequency ablation is an effective treatment option that provides 5-year overall, cancer specific and disease-free survival comparable to that of partial nephrectomy as well as better renal function preservation than partial nephrectomy.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12376615": "Minimally invasive alternatives to surgery for the treatment of malignancy are becoming more attractive owing to improvements in technology, reduced morbidity and mortality, and the ability to provide treatment in an outpatient setting. Radio-frequency (RF) ablation has become the imaging-guided ablative method of choice because of its relatively low cost, its capability of creating large regions of coagulative necrosis in a controlled fashion, and its relatively low toxicity. RF ablation in the thorax involves the use of computed tomography (CT) to localize the tumor and determine the optimal approach. The size of the tumor determines whether a cluster of electrodes or a single electrode of a particular length will be used to perform the ablation. CT fluoroscopy aids in guiding placement of the electrode. In patients with non-small cell lung malignancy who are not candidates for surgery owing to poor cardiorespiratory reserve, RF ablation alone or followed by conventional radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy may prove to be a treatment option. In patients with metastatic disease, RF ablation may be suitable for treatment of a small tumor burden or for palliation of larger tumors that cause symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, or pain. Patients with chest wall or osseous metastatic tumors in whom other therapies have failed may benefit from RF ablation as an alternative to radiation therapy.",

In order to further dissect this issue, we numerically and graphically modeled 28-joint disease activity scale (DAS28), simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and clinical disease activity index (CDAI) by three-dimensional (3D) plotting. We wished to graphically visualize the relative contribution of various elements in the three activity indices to each other. We calculated DAS28 (3 variables), SDAI, and CDAI by the standard equations. We plotted 3D \"carpets\" showing all combinations of the corresponding variables yielding to DAS28 = 5.1, DAS28 = 3.2, DAS28 = 2.6, SDAI = 26, SDAI = 11, and SDAI = 3.3. We also plotted the 3D carpet for CDAI. In patients with high or moderate disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) was not a major confounding factor when calculating DAS28 and SDAI, respectively. In contrast, ESR and CRP highly overshadowed changes in joint counts and global assessments in patients with low disease activity (LDA) or those in remission. No reliable assessment of LDA can be performed in cases where ESR &gt;54 mm/h or CRP &gt;20 mg/dl. Similarly, remission cannot be determined if ESR &gt;19 mm/h or CRP &gt;5 mg/dl. As CDAI does not include acute phase reactants, CDAI may be a useful tool even in states of remission or LDA. Our results suggest that acute phase reactants are indeed major confounding factors and should be omitted when assessing RA disease activity at least in special cases.",

The aim of this work was to assess disease activity states classified by DAS28, CDAI and SDAI and to analyse their agreement in the Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Register Reuma.pt. . A total of 2795 patients and 14 440 visits were selected from Reuma.pt for analysis. Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) were calculated for the three indices. McNemar's chi-squared tests, PCCs and kappa statistics were performed to analyse and compare the distribution of visits among all disease activity states and indices. A strong correlation was found between the three indices throughout the 14 440 visits: r = 0.874 for DAS28/CDAI, r = 0.877 for DAS28/SDAI and r = 0.984 for CDAI/SDAI (all PCCs with P &lt; 0.0001). However, when categorization in the different disease activity states was analysed, McNemar's chi-squared tests and PCCs revealed significant disagreement between the cut-offs of the three indices. DAS28, CDAI and SDAI cut-offs do not translate into the same clinical information in Reuma.pt. Although this might be expected for the original DAS28 cut-offs, when compared with CDAI and SDAI significant disagreement was also found for the DAS28 modified cut-offs. For visits where patients are in CDAI or SDAI remission, we also find disagreement between these two indices, which may contradict previous conclusions that acute phase reactants add little to composite disease activity indices for RA.",

Disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)-remission has not been included among American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism definitions, because of its association with significant residual disease activity, partly due to high weighting of acute-phase reactants (APR). New, more stringent cut-points for DAS28-remission have recently been proposed that are suggested to reflect remission by clinical and simplified disease activity indices (clinical disease activity index (CDAI), simple disease activity index (SDAI)). However, their stringency in therapies directly influencing APR, like IL-6-blockers, has not been tested. We tested the new cut-points in patients with RA receiving tocilizumab. We used data from randomised controlled trials of tocilizumab and evaluated patients in remission according to new DAS28-C-reactive protein (DAS-CRP) and DAS-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS-ESR) cut-points (1.9 and 2.2). We assessed their disease activity state using the CDAI, SDAI and Boolean criteria and analysed their individual residual core set variables, like swollen joint counts (SJC28). About 50% of patients in DAS28-CRP-remission (&lt;1.9) fell into higher disease activity states when assessed with CDAI, SDAI or Boolean criteria. Also, 15% had three or more (up to eight) SJC. Even higher disease activity was seen in patients classified as being in DAS28-ESR-remission (&lt;2.2). Even with new, more stringent cut-points, DAS28-remission is frequently associated with considerable residual clinical disease activity, indicating that this limitation of the DAS28 is related to score construction rather than the choice of cut-points.",

As such, a methodologically robust means of converting the old DAS to the new DAS28 measure would be invaluable. Using data from The Early RA Study (ERAS), a sub-sample of patients with both DAS and DAS28 data were used to develop new regression imputation formulas using the total DAS score (univariate), and using the separate components of the DAS score (multivariate). DAS were transformed to DAS28 using an existing formula quoted in the literature, and the newly developed formulas. Bland and Altman plots were used to compare the transformed DAS with the recorded DAS28 to ascertain levels of agreement. The current transformation formula tended to overestimate the true DAS28 score, particularly at the higher end of the scale. A formula which uses all separate components of the DAS was found to estimate the scores with a higher level of precision.

Consecutive RA patients underwent clinical and clinimetric assessment. The DAS28-P index was derived from the components of the DAS28 scores by rearranging the DAS28-ESR formula.

We evaluated 511 patients with long-standing refractory rheumatoid arthritis treated with intravenous infusions of infliximab 3 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 and every 8 weeks thereafter for 4 years. Among the initial 511 patients included in the study, 479 could be evaluated; of these, 295 (61.6%) were still receiving infliximab treatment at year 4 of follow-up. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were lack of efficacy (65 patients, 13.6%), safety (81 patients, 16.9%), and elective change (38 patients, 7.9%). Analysis of disease activity scores (DAS28 [disease activity score based on the 28-joint count]) over time showed that, after the initial rapid improvement during the first 6 to 22 weeks of therapy, a further decrease in disease activity of 0.2 units in the DAS28 score per year was observed. DAS28 scores, measured at week 14 or 22, were found to predict subsequent discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. In conclusion, long-term maintenance therapy with infliximab 3 mg/kg is effective in producing further reductions in disease activity. Disease activity measured by the DAS28 at week 14 or 22 of infliximab therapy was the best predictor of long-term attrition.",

Active inflammatory disease contributes to pain, but pain due to non-inflammatory mechanisms can confound the assessment of disease activity. We hypothesize that augmented pain processing, fibromyalgic features, poorer mental health, and patient-reported 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) components are associated in RA. In total, 50 people with stable, long-standing RA recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic were assessed for pain-pressure thresholds (PPTs) at three separate sites (knee, tibia, and sternum), DAS28, fibromyalgia, and mental health status. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess the association between PPT and DAS28 components, DAS28-P (the proportion of DAS28 derived from the patient-reported components of visual analogue score and tender joint count), or fibromyalgia status. More-sensitive PPTs at sites over or distant from joints were each associated with greater reported pain, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health. A high proportion of participants (48%) satisfied classification criteria for fibromyalgia, and fibromyalgia classification or characteristics were each associated with more sensitive PPTs, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health. Widespread sensitivity to pressure-induced pain, a high prevalence of fibromyalgic features, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health are all linked in established RA. The increased sensitivity at nonjoint sites (sternum and anterior tibia), as well as over joints, indicates that central mechanisms may contribute to pain sensitivity in RA. The contribution of patient-reported components to high DAS28 should inform decisions on disease-modifying or pain-management approaches in the treatment of RA when inflammation may be well controlled.",

Between 2000 and 2001, 511 patients with severe and refractory RA were enrolled and treated with infliximab. After 7 years, apart from routine clinical follow-up, treating rheumatologists were asked to complete a questionnaire designed specifically for the present study to evaluate the current therapy with infliximab, the level of disease activity (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28]) and the reasons for infliximab discontinuation. After 7 years, 160 of 511 patients (31%) were still on infliximab treatment. The major reasons for infliximab discontinuation included lack of efficacy (104 patients), adverse events (107 patients) and elective change of therapy (70 patients). The majority of cases of treatment discontinuation for safety reasons occurred during the first 2 years. In contrast, discontinuation due to ineffectiveness showed a more constant rate over the 7-year period. Mean DAS for patients still on treatment with infliximab decreased from 5.7 (standard error [SE] 0.1) at baseline to 3.0 (SE 0.1) at year 4 and remained that low until year 7 (3.0 [SE 0.1]). Low disease activity (defined as DAS28&lt;3.2) was present in 60.9% of patients, and 45.5% achieved remission (DAS28&lt;2.6). DAS28 at the time of treatment discontinuation due to ineffectiveness decreased over the 7-year period from 5.6 (SE 0.3) in 2001 to 4.8 (SE 0.3) in 2008. This observational study revealed that patients who continue to receive infliximab experience sustained clinical benefit. The majority of safety issues occurred during the first 2 years of infliximab therapy. We observed that the DAS at the time of therapy discontinuation showed a trend to decrease over time.",

HAQ for functional capacity was completed by 135 patients with rheumatoid arthritis referred for orthopaedic surgery (74% women; mean (SD) age 62 (10) years; disease duration 19 (13) years, 70% positive for rheumatoid factor). Knee extension, trunk extension and flexion, grip strength, walking speed, and sit-to-stand test were measured to mirror physical function. Radiographs of hands and feet, pain, and the modified 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28) were also assessed. Mean total HAQ was 1.08 (0.68) in women and 0.67 (0.70) in men (p = 0.0031). Women had greater disability than men in five of the eight subdimensions of the HAQ. Grip strength was 48%, knee extension strength 46%, trunk extension strength 54%, and trunk flexion strength 43% lower in women than in men. Knee extension strength was inversely correlated with walking time (r = -0.63 (95% confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.51)) and with sit-to-stand test (r = -0.47 (-0.60 to -0.31)). In an ordered logistic regression analysis in female rheumatoid patients, DAS28, pain, knee extension strength, and grip strength were associated with the total HAQ disability index. Women reported greater disability than men both in the total HAQ and in the majority of its eight subdimensions. In addition to disease activity and pain, muscle strength has a major impact on disability especially in female rheumatoid patients.",

A DAS28 score of greater than 3.2 is a well-described limit for treatment intensification; however, the reliability of DAS28 might be overestimated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of DAS28 in RA, especially focusing on a subgroup of patients with a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2. Data from RA patients registered in the local part of Danish DANBIO Registry were collected in May 2015. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: First, those with DAS28 &gt;3.2 with at least one swollen joint (SJ) or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (\"objective group\"), and second, patients with a DAS28 &gt;3.2 who had no SJ, and CRP values were within the reference range (\"subjective group\"). Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints, Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were calculated for each group. We defined new score, DAS28 subjective, to focus on subjective parameters. Two hundred thirty patients were included; 198 (86.1%) and 32 (13.9%) patients were in the objective and subjective groups, respectively. Patients in the subjective group had lower mean values of DAS28 (P &lt; 0.001) and Evaluator Global Assessment (P &lt; 0.001) with less common immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor (P &lt; 0.001) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positivity (P = 0.02) and contrarily higher mean values of tender joints (P = 0.04) and DAS28 based on subjective parameters (P = 0.003) compared with the objective group.

We administered a Maximum Difference Scaling survey to 106 rheumatologists and 213 patients with RA. The survey included 58 factors related to the decision to escalate care in RA. Participants answered 24 choice tasks. In each task, participants were asked to choose the most important factor from a set of 5. We used hierarchical Bayes modeling to generate the mean relative importance score (RIS) for each factor. For rheumatologists, the 5 most influential factors were number of swollen joints (mean \u00b1 SD RIS 5.2 \u00b1 0.4), DAS28 score (mean \u00b1 SD RIS 5.2 \u00b1 0.5), physician global assessment of disease activity (mean \u00b1 SD RIS 5.2 \u00b1 0.6), worsening erosions over the last year (mean \u00b1 SD RIS 5.2 \u00b1 0.5), and RA disease activity now compared to 3 months ago (mean \u00b1 SD RIS 5.1 \u00b1 0.6).

However, such comparison is lacking in African Americans with RA. This analysis included participants from the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) registry, which enrolls self-declared African Americans with RA. Using tender and swollen joint counts, separate ESR-based and CRP-based DAS28 scores (DAS28-ESR3 and DAS28-CRP3) were calculated, as were DAS28-ESR4 and DAS28-CRP4, which included the patient's assessment of disease activity. The scores were compared using paired t-test, simple agreement and \u03ba, correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plots. Of the 233 included participants, 85% were women, mean age at enrollment was 52.6 years, and median disease duration at enrollment was 21 months. Mean DAS28-ESR3 was significantly higher than DAS28-CRP3 (4.8 vs 3.9; p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, mean DAS28-ESR4 was significantly higher than DAS28-CRP4 (4.7 vs 3.9; p &lt; 0.001).

We hypothesized that psychological factors (cognitions and mood) would be more strongly associated with patient-reported components of the DAS28 than clinical or biochemical components. A cross-sectional, observational study of 322 RA patients with active disease (mean DAS28 6.0) awaiting therapy with a biologic agent was undertaken. Patients' illness beliefs, treatment beliefs, and mood were measured using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Relationships between psychological factors and 1) total DAS28 and 2) individual components of the DAS28 were analyzed using linear regression. Total DAS28 produced significant but weak associations with 2 of the Brief IPQ items, but no associations with BMQ or HADS scores. There were larger significant associations between the patient-reported visual analog scale (VAS) with 5 items of the Brief IPQ and with HADS depression. Low illness coherence was associated with higher tender joint count. Three Brief IPQ items and HADS anxiety scores were significantly associated with C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No psychological factors were associated with the swollen joint count.

Latent class mixed modeling of response to biologic treatment was applied to 2,991 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in whom treatment with a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug was being initiated within the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate cohort, using both 4-component and 2-component DAS28 scores as outcome measures. Patient groups with similar trajectories were compared in terms of pretreatment baseline characteristics (including disability and comorbidities) and follow-up characteristics (including antidrug antibody events, adherence to treatments, and blood drug levels). We compared the trajectories obtained using the 4- and 2-component scores to determine which characteristics were better captured by each. Using the 4-component DAS28, we identified 3 trajectory groups, which is consistent with previous findings. We showed that the 4-component DAS28 captures information relating to depression. Using the 2-component DAS28, 7 trajectory groups were identified; among them, distinct groups of nonresponders had a higher incidence of respiratory comorbidities and a higher proportion of antidrug antibody events. We also identified a group of patients for whom the 2-component DAS28 scores remained relatively low; this group included a high percentage of patients who were nonadherent to treatment. This highlights the utility of both the 4- and 2-component DAS28 for monitoring different components of disease activity. Here we show that the 2-component modified DAS28 defines important biologic and clinical phenotypes associated with treatment outcome in RA and characterizes important underlying response mechanisms to biologic drugs.",

A total of 160 ankle joints of 80 RA patients were examined using MSUS and PDUS, according to the European League Against Rheumatism MSUS guidelines. Additionally, the talonavicular joints (TNJs) and the medial and the lateral tendon compartments were examined. The visual analog scale (VAS) score was recorded for each patient. A total of 80 RA patients with a median age of 60 years and disease duration of 5 years were enrolled in our study. The median DAS28 score was 5. A total of 97 ankles were painful (VAS 1-10), whereas 63 ankles were asymptomatic (VAS 0). Overall, the predominant pathology was arthritis of the tibiotalar joint (TTJ) and/or TNJ in 124 ankles (77%), followed by tenosynovitis of the medial compartment tendons in 44 ankles (28%). Arthritis of the TTJ was present in 59% and synovitis of the TNJ in 35% of the symptomatic ankles. In asymptomatic ankles, TTJ synovitis was detected in 35%, whereas TNJ arthritis was observed in 18%. PDUS activity was higher in the subgroup of symptomatic ankles.

There are at least five different versions of the 'Patient Global' Visual Analogue Scale (PG-VAS) being used in the DAS28. The developers suggested that the PG-VAS can be an assessment of global health or disease activity, but did not specify the wording of the question. There is no consensus on what the PG-VAS is intended to capture, and the different words and phrases have not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to test if phrasing affects PG-VAS scores and hence yields different results for the DAS28. Fifty patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking biologic agents in a rheumatology outpatient department completed a self-administered questionnaire containing five versions of the 100 mm PG-VAS. All PG-VAS versions correlated strongly with each other (rho = 0.67-0.87, p &lt; 0.0001). However, individual scores for each PG-VAS, when compared with the comparator on a Bland-Altman chart had wide limits of agreement--the largest being -42 mm to +45 mm. The five overall DAS28 scores were calculated for each patient using the five different PG-VAS. The largest difference in DAS28 scores was 0.63. Different phrasing of the PG-VAS gives different DAS28 results. As the DAS28 is a key outcome measure, such differences have the potential to influence clinical decisions relating to eligibility for biologic agents and evaluation of new therapies. We urgently need to decide on the concept to be measured and the phrasing required to capture this. The PG-VAS phrasing should then be standardized and validated.",

Functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], disease activity [28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)], and radiographic joint damage [Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS)] were measured in 4 consecutive randomized controlled trials with increasingly intensive (tight control) treatment strategies. Average followup time for the 3 cohorts was 97, 53, and 50 months, respectively. Next to current DAS28, the previous DAS28 was used to study the predictive effect of a change in DAS28 on progression of functional disability (HAQ). Finally, it was investigated whether SHS mediated the predictive effect of DAS28. In patients treated with intensive treatment strategies, the progression of HAQ over time was statistically significantly less (p &lt; 0.0001). The predictive influence of DAS28 on HAQ progression increased over the duration of the disease. SHS was not found to influence HAQ progression and did not mediate the predictive effect of DAS28. In the less intensively treated patients, the direct effect of disease activity decreased with disease duration, and contrarily, SHS did influence HAQ progression, but was not found to (fully) mediate the predictive effect of DAS28. In patients with RA treated with modern treatment strategies, there is less functional decline over time. Further, disease activity does predict functional decline but joint damage does not. This might indicate that factors associated with cumulative disease activity but not visible on radiographs can influence functional decline in patients with RA. This further underlines the importance of disease activity as a treatment target in early RA and in established RA.",

Nine hundred and sixty-seven case scenarios with various levels for each component of the DAS28 (resulting in a disease activity score between 2 and 3.2) were presented to 44 panelists. For each scenario, panelists had to decide whether or not DMARD treatment (excluding steroids) could be maintained unchanged. In each scenario, for decision, the participants were given the DAS28 parameters, without knowledge of the resultant DAS28. The relationship between panelists' decision, DAS28 value, and components of the score were analysed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Each panelist analysed 160 randomised scenarios. Intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility were assessed. Forty-four panelists participated in the study. Inter-panelist agreement was good (kappa = 0.63; 95% confidence interval = 0.61 to 0.65).

Multivariate analysis confirmed the relationship between panelist's decision, DAS28 value and components of the DAS28. Between DAS28 of 2.4 and 3.2, a major determinant for panelists' decision was swollen joint count. Female and public practice physicians decided more often to maintain treatment unchanged.

The proportions of patients achieving Boolean, SDAI, CDAI, or DAS28(CRP) remission were calculated for 3 trials: PREMIER and OPTIMA in patients with early RA and DE019 in patients with established RA. At the first visit that remission was recorded during the first 52 weeks of the trial, the following were assessed: swollen/tender joint count at 28 and 66/68 joints, CRP, Patient's/Physician's Global Assessment (PGA/PhGA), SDAI, DAS28(CRP), and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index. The majority of patients (61-66%) who achieved SDAI or CDAI remission also attained Boolean remission. Although DAS28(CRP) remission was most frequently attained, 74-77% of patients in DAS28(CRP) remission did not achieve Boolean remission. Compared with patients in Boolean remission, patients in SDAI or CDAI remission but not Boolean remission had higher PGA scores, while patients with DAS28(CRP) remission but not Boolean remission had higher joint counts, and PGA and PhGA scores. Differences in PGA limit patients in SDAI/CDAI remission from meeting the Boolean remission criteria, suggesting that these criteria otherwise can be used interchangeably.

The CDAI does not contain an acute-phase reactant component. Disease activity states, including remission, were defined using established cut points; for the DAS28, an alternative cut point of &lt;2.4 was also used. Changes in the DAS28, the SDAI score, and the CDAI score among patients receiving tocilizumab were significantly higher than those among patients receiving placebo, and the magnitude of these changes was similar for the SDAI and the CDAI. Among patients who achieved 50% improvement in disease activity according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, only \u223c20% required a reduction in acute-phase reactant values in order to fulfill the criteria. However, DAS28 remission rates were higher (even when using the lower cut point) than the SDAI and CDAI remission rates. Only a minority of tocilizumab-treated patients with DAS28 remission also had disease remission according to the SDAI (26%) or CDAI (\u223c21%).

Disease activity in RA is reduced by tocilizumab treatment, irrespective of the type of composite measure used to evaluate disease activity. Remission rates were much higher using the DAS28 compared with the SDAI and CDAI, due to the high weight of the ESR in the DAS28 and the effect of tocilizumab on the ESR. Using the stringent SDAI and CDAI criteria, however, remission rates in patients treated with tocilizumab were in the same range as those seen in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.",

The higher limit for overlapping was defined as the highest SJC in the low disease activity group, and the lower limit as the lowest SJC in the high disease activity group; the percentage of patients who fall between these limits represent overlapping in SJC. Overlapping was calculated similarly concerning TJC, ESR, and GH. ESR had the greatest effect on DAS28, followed by TJC, GH, and SJC, while in the \"theoretical model\" TJC had the greatest effect on the DAS28, followed by ESR, SJC, and GH. At 6 months, overlapping was present in 54%, 45%, 49%, and 31% of patients in SJC, TJC, GH, and ESR, respectively. In real-life patients, ESR had the greatest effect of the 4 components of DAS28 on the total DAS28 score. The values of the individual components of DAS28 overlap considerably among the 3 disease activity groups.",

This study investigates if, and to what extent, non-adherence to treatment would lead to a higher 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) in the first year after diagnosis. Adult patients from an ongoing cohort study on treatment adherence were selected if they fulfilled the EULAR/ACR2010 criteria for RA, and were to start with their first DMARDs. Clinical variables were assessed at baseline and every 3 months. Non-adherence was continuously electronically measured and was defined as the proportion of days with a negative difference between expected and observed openings of the medication container out of the 3-month period before DAS28 measurement. Generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate whether the DAS28 related to non-adherence. Covariates included were age, sex, baseline DAS28, rheumatoid factor positivity, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) positivity, anxiety, depression, weeks of treatment, number of DMARDs used, education level, use of subcutaneous methotrexate and biological use. One hundred and twenty patients met the inclusion criteria for RA. During the study period 17 patients became lost to follow-up. There was a decline in adherence over time for all DMARDs except for prednisone. Non-adherence is a predictor of disease activity in the first 6 months of therapy, adjusted for weeks of treatment, baseline DAS28, and baseline anxiety. Non-adherence relates to disease activity. Therefore, interventions towards enhancing adherence can improve disease outcome.",

ABT was administrated intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) for 36 weeks to patients with RA, who had not previously received bDMARDs. As the ABT tapering protocol, ABT was administrated SC at 125 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks in patients with remission. RA disease activity was assessed by DAS28-CRP and ultrasonography. Remission was assessed by defining it as DAS28-CRP &lt;2.3. Of the 51 patients, 84.3% were women (mean age 68.7 \u00b1 10.2 years, mean disease duration 7.7 \u00b1 10.2 years). Twenty-nine patients achieved remission and a power Doppler (PD) score \u22641 at each joint at 36 weeks, followed by tapering ABT.

We compared RA disease activity using 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and its components, and EULAR response, between patients with and without AITD, using logistic regression. At diagnosis, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs; patient global, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and pain) but not objective disease activity measures (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and swollen joint count) were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05 for all PROMs) among RA patients with AITD compared with those without.

This study examined the reliability of the DAS28 in patients with early RA using principles from generalizability theory and evaluated whether it could be increased by adjusting individual DAS28 component weights. Patients were drawn from the DREAM registry and classified into a \"fast response\" group (N = 466) and \"slow response\" group (N = 80), depending on their pace of reaching remission. Composite reliabilities of the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were determined with the individual components' reliability, weights, variances, error variances, correlations and covariances. Weight optimization was performed by minimizing the error variance of the index. Composite reliabilities of 0.85 and 0.86 were found for the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP, respectively, and were approximately equal across patients groups. Component reliabilities, however, varied widely both within and between sub-groups, ranging from 0.614 for GH (\"slow response\" group) to 0.912 for ESR (\"fast response\" group). Weight optimization increased composite reliability even further. In the total and \"fast response\" groups, this was achieved mostly by decreasing the weight of the TJC28 and GH. In the \"slow response\" group, though, the weights of the TJC28 and SJC28 were increased, while those of the inflammatory markers and GH were substantially decreased. The DAS28-ESR and the DAS28-CRP are reliable instruments for assessing disease activity in early RA and reliability can be increased even further by adjusting component weights. Given the low reliability and weightings of the general health component across subgroups it is recommended to explore alternative patient-reported outcome measures for inclusion in the DAS28.",

Statistical evaluation was carried out by applying the Cronbach's values and principal component analysis (internal consistency reliability), the Pearson's coefficients, ANOVA and kappa statistic (convergent validity) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (discriminant validity). Internal consistency testing of both scores indicated a reasonable difference, with Cronbach's alpha slightly higher for the DAS28.

In subset 1 (149 patients and 819 disease activity assessments), the mathematical function of the DAS28-squeeze was constructed using a linear regression model with the DAS as the dependent variable and the DAS28 and squeeze test as the independent variables. A DAS28-BCP disease state was also constructed, in which DAS28 disease state categorizations were upgraded one state if the result of the squeeze test was positive. In subset 2 (153 patients and 754 assessments), concordance in disease states between the DAS28, DAS28-squeeze, and DAS28-BCP disease states was compared, using both the DAS and Boolean-defined remission criteria as reference. Agreement between the DAS and the DAS28-squeeze (82%) was significantly higher than agreement between the DAS and the DAS28 (76%).

The primary end point was endogenous insulin production, as assessed according to the area under the concentration-time curve for C-peptide level in response to a 4-hour mixed-meal tolerance test (4-hour C-peptide AUC) at week 52. Secondary and additional end points included insulin use, the glycated hemoglobin level, the number of hypoglycemic events, the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide over time, and response profile.

Both RBPs exhibited different exchange kinetics between SGs. Within SGs, single-molecule localization microscopy revealed distributed hotspots of immobilized G3BP1 and IMP1 that reflect the presence of relatively immobile nanometer-sized nanocores. We demonstrate alternating binding in nanocores and anomalous diffusion in the liquid phase with similar characteristics for both RBPs. Reduction of low-complexity regions in G3BP1 resulted in less detectable mobile molecules in the liquid phase without change in binding in nanocores. The data provide direct support for liquid droplet behavior of SGs in living cells and reveal transient binding of RBPs in nanocores.

SG cores recruit a dynamic shell, whose properties are dominated by weak interactions between proteins and RNAs [8-10].

Using super-resolution and expansion microscopy, we find that the SG component UBAP2L [11, 12] and the core protein G3BP1 [5, 11-13] occupy different domains inside SGs. UBAP2L displays typical properties of a core protein, indicating that cores of different compositions coexist inside the same granule. Consistent with a role as a core protein, UBAP2L is required for SG assembly in several stress conditions. Our reverse genetic and cell biology experiments suggest that UBAP2L forms granules independent of G3BP1 and 2 but does not interfere with stress-induced translational inhibition. We propose a model in which UBAP2L is an essential SG nucleator that acts upstream of G3BP1 and 2 and facilitates G3BP1 core formation and SG assembly and growth.",

The truncated lamin A protein produced \"progerin\" has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. It is also found that calcitriol, the active hormonal form of vitamin D, rescues RS and represses the cGAS/STING/IFN cascade. Here, the mechanisms underlying RS in progerin-expressing cells and the rescue by calcitriol are explored. It is found that progerin elicits a marked downregulation of RAD51, concomitant with increased levels of phosphorylated-RPA, a marker of RS. Interestingly, calcitriol prevents RS and activation of the cGAS/STING/IFN response in part through maintenance of RAD51 levels in progerin-expressing cells. Thus, loss of RAD51 is one of the consequences of progerin expression that can contribute to RS and activation of the IFN response. Stabilization of RAD51 helps explain the beneficial effects of calcitriol in these processes.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30548460": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating premature aging disease. Mouse models have been instrumental for understanding HGPS mechanisms and for testing therapies, which to date have had only marginal benefits in mice and patients. Barriers to developing effective therapies include the unknown etiology of progeria mice early death, seemingly unrelated to the reported atherosclerosis contributing to HGPS patient mortality, and mice not recapitulating the severity of human disease. Here, we show that progeria mice die from starvation and cachexia. Switching progeria mice approaching death from regular diet to high-fat diet (HFD) rescues early lethality and ameliorates morbidity. Critically, feeding the mice only HFD delays aging and nearly doubles lifespan, which is the greatest lifespan extension recorded in progeria mice. The extended lifespan allows for progeria mice to develop degenerative aging pathologies of a severity that emulates the human disease. We propose that starvation and cachexia greatly influence progeria phenotypes and that nutritional/nutraceutical strategies might help modulate disease progression. Importantly, progeria mice on HFD provide a more clinically relevant animal model to study mechanisms of HGPS pathology and to test therapies.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23666920": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in LMNA, which encodes the nuclear scaffold proteins lamin A and C. In HGPS and related progerias, processing of prelamin A is blocked at a critical step mediated by the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. LMNA-linked progerias can be grouped into two classes: (1) the processing-deficient, early onset \"typical\" progerias (e.g., HGPS), and (2) the processing-proficient \"atypical\" progeria syndromes (APS) that are later in onset. Here we describe a previously unrecognized progeria syndrome with prominent cutaneous and cardiovascular manifestations belonging to the second class. We suggest the name LMNA-associated cardiocutaneous progeria syndrome (LCPS) for this disorder. Affected patients are normal at birth but undergo progressive cutaneous changes in childhood and die in middle age of cardiovascular complications, including accelerated atherosclerosis, calcific valve disease, and cardiomyopathy. In addition, the proband demonstrated cancer susceptibility, a phenotype rarely described for LMNA-based progeria disorders. The LMNA mutation that caused LCPS in this family is a heterozygous c.899A&gt;G (p.D300G) mutation predicted to alter the coiled-coil domain of lamin A/C. In skin fibroblasts isolated from the proband, the processing and levels of lamin A and C are normal. However, nuclear morphology is aberrant and rescued by treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitors, as is also the case for HGPS and other laminopathies. Our findings advance knowledge of human LMNA progeria syndromes, and raise the possibility that typical and atypical progerias may converge upon a common mechanism to cause premature aging disease.",

Defining the full scope of radiologic abnormalities requires examination of a large proportion of the world's progeria population (estimated at 1 in 4 million). There has been no comprehensive prospective study describing the skeletal abnormalities associated with progeria. To define characteristic radiographic features of this syndrome. Thirty-nine children with classic progeria, ages 2-17 years, from 29 countries were studied at a single site. Comprehensive radiographic imaging studies were performed. Sample included 23 girls and 16 boys-the largest number of patients with progeria evaluated prospectively to date. Eight new and two little known progeria-associated radiologic findings were identified (frequencies of 3-36%). Additionally, 23 commonly reported findings were evaluated. Of these, 2 were not encountered and 21 were present and ranked according to their frequency. Nine abnormalities were associated with increasing patient age (P = 0.02-0.0001). This study considerably expands the radiographic morphological spectrum of progeria. A better understanding of the radiologic abnormalities associated with progeria and improved understanding of the biology of progerin (the molecule responsible for this disease), will improve our ability to treat the spectrum of bony abnormalities.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16429102": "Progeria is a rare, genetically determined condition characterized by accelerated aging in children. Its name is derived from Greek (Geron) and means \"prematurely old\". The classic type is the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), which was first described in England in 1886 by Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson (1) and again in 1904 by Dr. Hastings Gilford (2). Since then and up to now, very little advancement toward the understanding of this devastating disorder has been accomplished. In early 2003 a French group succeeded in identifying point mutations in the LMNA gene, encoding A-type lamins, as the main cause of this disorder. These results were concomitantly confirmed by an American group, who identified mutations in LMNA, working on a large cohort of patients (3,4). HGPS is thus the most severe disorder added to the expanding list of \"laminopathies\", diseases caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding A-type lamins. To date, up to ten disorders are associated with mutations in LMNA. These disorders are diverse, both in their symptomatology and pattern of inheritance (see below and table 1). Due to the extremely low prevalence of progeria and the putative functional links between progeria and other premature aging disorders, setting-up a network about these disorders has become an absolute necessity. A reunion of families with a child affected with progeria, gathered within the European Progeria Family Circle, was held from September 25th to 29th 2003 in Magdeburg, Germany. In parallel to this event, a scientific symposium centered on clinical and molecular update of HGPS and related syndromes was organised. Several international experts, including clinical and molecular geneticists, cell biologists involved in the field of laminopathies, as well as paediatricians and other physicians with clinical experience in diagnosis, treatment and research on progeria and progeria-like syndromes presented their experience as well as their research projects and yet unpublished results. The main discussed topics as well as the developing research fields on progeria and related premature ageing disorders will be presented here.",

This review illustrates the main radiographic features of Werner syndrome, focusing on the musculoskeletal system, such as soft-tissue calcification, muscular atrophy, osteoporosis, foot deformities, osteitis and osteomyelitis, and bone or soft-tissues malignancies.

The diagnosis is essentially clinical and the manifestations become more evident from the first year of life. Long term outcome data from Progeria Research Foundation clinical trials have demonstrated an increase in survival in recent years. Even though new trials are ongoing, the recognition of this syndrome is essential to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. A patient, initially asymptomatic, who developed characteristic signs of the syndrome at the age of 6 months is reported. She was referred for evaluation only when she was two years and eleven months old. The diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome was suspected owing to clinical characteristics. The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic testing. A mutation c.1824C&gt; T in exon 11 of the LMNA gene was detected. She was registered in the Progeria Research Foundation and was invited to participate in the weighing and supplementation program. She was included in the lonafarnib protocol study. This medication is a farnesyl transferase inhibitor that prevents the production of progerina and slows cardiovascular and neurological complications of the syndrome. This case highlights the importance of diagnosing progeria patients because they may be referred to the Progeria Research Foundation, which offers genetic screening and inclusion in clinical and therapeutic follow-up protocols without any costs. Progeria trials and research may also contribute to new drug developments related to prevention of aging and atherosclerosis in the near future.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8459803": "The glycosylation of proteins in fibroblasts from people with the premature ageing disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (progeria) was investigated. Protein was prepared from fibroblast cell lines established from skin biopsy taken from progeria patients and control donors. Glycoproteins were labelled by the covalent attachment of the steroid hapten digoxygenin to the sugar group. After separation of total protein by SDS-PAGE and electroblotting onto Immobilon-PTM, glycoproteins were detected by enzyme immunoassay. We have observed a glycoprotein of M(r) 200 kDa which is consistently present in protein preparations from progeria fibroblasts and which is absent, or markedly reduced, in preparations from control fibroblasts. This suggests that it may be useful as a marker for progeria. Similar analysis of progeria lymphoblast and control lymphoblast cultures did not show this altered pattern of glycosylated proteins, indicating that it may be cell-type specific. Glycoproteins were also detected by labelling fibroblasts in vitro with D-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride followed by SDS-PAGE of isolated protein and subsequent fluorography. Profiles of glycoproteins from progeria and control fibroblasts were consistent with those obtained from labelling of carbohydrate groups with digoxygenin. Protease digestion of cell protein verified that the band at M(r) 200 kDa contains a protein core. Characteristic features of progeria primarily involve the connective tissue and include wrinkled and loose skin, loss of soft tissue, thin limbs and stiff joints. Death of progeria patients is usually a result of cardiovascular abnormalities. The most consistent manifestations thus involve the connective tissue. The glycoprotein of M(r) 200 kDa which we have observed in progeria fibroblasts in vitro could reflect a perturbation in glycosylation which may underly the connective tissue defects seen in progeria.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18769635": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare disease that results in what appears to be premature aging, is caused by the production of a mutant form of prelamin A known as progerin. Progerin retains a farnesyl lipid anchor at its carboxyl terminus, a modification that is thought to be important in disease pathogenesis. Inhibition of protein farnesylation improves the hallmark nuclear shape abnormalities in HGPS cells and ameliorates disease phenotypes in mice harboring a knockin HGPS mutation (LmnaHG/+). The amelioration of disease, however, is incomplete, leading us to hypothesize that nonfarnesylated progerin also might be capable of eliciting disease. To test this hypothesis, we created knockin mice expressing nonfarnesylated progerin (LmnanHG/+). LmnanHG/+ mice developed the same disease phenotypes observed in LmnaHG/+ mice, although the phenotypes were milder, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from these mice contained fewer misshapen nuclei. The steady-state levels of progerin in LmnanHG/+ MEFs and tissues were lower, suggesting a possible explanation for the milder phenotypes. These data support the concept that inhibition of protein farnesylation in progeria could be therapeutically useful but also suggest that this approach may be limited, as progerin elicits disease phenotypes whether or not it is farnesylated.",

Many children with progeria appear normal at birth and then progressively, and rather rapidly, develop the characteristic features during early childhood. Although first described in the 1880s, only approximately 100 cases of progeria are reported in the international literature. The single case study of hearing in progeria, which appeared in 1965, is limited to pure-tone and speech audiometry findings. We report the results of otolaryngologic examination and pure-tone, speech, immittance, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiometry for a 5-year-old female with progeria. The patient had a mild-to-moderate, bilateral, conductive hearing loss. Immittance measurements were consistent with fixation of the ossicular chain and this was confirmed surgically.

In patients with progeria, HA excretion ranged from 169 micrograms HA/g creatinine to 1440 micrograms HA/g creatinine. In normal age-matched controls, HA excreted ranged from 0 to 77 micrograms HA/g creatinine. In all, a mean 17-fold increase in HA excretion was observed in patients with progeria when compared with age-matched normal controls. Total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion was not elevated.
