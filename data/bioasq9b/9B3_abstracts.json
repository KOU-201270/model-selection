Fingolimod was synthesized by the research group of Tetsuro Fujita at Kyoto University in 1992 while investigating structure-activity relationships of derivatives of the fungal metabolite ISP-I, isolated from Isaria sinclairii. Fingolimod becomes active in vivo following phosphorylation by sphingosine kinase 2 to form fingolimod-phosphate, which binds to extracellular G protein-coupled receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphates, and prevents the release of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissue. Fingolimod is orally active, which is unique among current first-line MS therapies, and it has the potential to be used in the treatment of organ transplants and cancer. This review highlights the discovery and development of fingolimod, from an isolated lead natural product, through synthetic analogues, to an approved drug.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12874382": "The mechanisms by which the hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, decreases transferrin-mediated iron uptake were examined. Coimmunoprecipitation studies using solubilized cell extracts demonstrated that transferrin (Tf) competed with HFE for binding to the transferrin receptor (TfR) similar to previous in vitro studies using soluble truncated forms of HFE and the TfR. At concentrations of Tf approaching those found in the blood, no differences in Tf binding to cells were detected, which is consistent with the lower binding constant of HFE for TfR versus Tf. However, cells expressing HFE still showed a decrease in Tf-mediated iron uptake at concentrations of Tf sufficient to dissociate HFE from the TfR. These results indicate that the association of HFE with TfR is not essential for its ability to lower intracellular iron stores. To test the effect of HFE on lowering intracellular iron levels independently of its association with TfR, a mutated HFE (fW81AHFE) that shows greatly reduced affinity for the TfR was transfected into tetracycline-controlled transactivator HeLa cells. HeLa cells expressing fW81AHFE behaved in a similar manner to cells expressing wild-type HFE with respect to decreased intracellular iron levels measured by iron regulatory protein gel-shift assays and ferritin levels. The results indicate that HFE can lower intracellular iron levels independently of its interaction with the TfR.",

Identification of a candidate HFE gene in 1996 was soon followed by the description of two ancestral mutations, i.e., c.845G--&gt;A (C282Y) and c.187C--&gt;G (H63D). To these was recently added the mutation S65C, which may represent a simple polymorphism. The incidence of HH in Greece is unknown but clinical cases are rare. Also unknown is the carrier frequency of the two mutant alleles. A first estimate of the latter is given in the present report. It is based on data from the genetic analysis of 10 unrelated patients of Greek origin who were referred to our center for genotyping and 158 unselected male blood donors. The allele frequencies for the C282Y and H63D mutations were 0.003 and 0.145, respectively. The C282Y allele was detected in 50% of HH patients. This is considerably lower than the frequencies reported for HH patients in the U.S.A. (82%) and France (91 %) and closer to that reported in Italy (64%). Five patients did not carry any known HFE mutation; three may represent cases of juvenile hemochromatosis, given their early onset with iron overload, hypogonadism, and heart disease. We suggest that genetic heterogeneity is more prominent in Southern Europe. It is also possible that the penetrance of the responsible genes is different across the Mediterranean.",

DNA samples of patient and control groups were screened for two common haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations. The local frequencies of mutations C282Y and H63D were determined and the DNA results correlated with biochemical parameters. Patients were referred from private practitioners, health workers and pathologists for a molecular diagnosis of HH at the University of Stellenbosch Medical School. Twenty-two of the 244 referrals were clinically diagnosed with HH, while the remaining patients were family members of the probands or unrelated subjects referred solely on the basis of an abnormal iron profile. Seventeen of the 22 patient referrals (77%) diagnosed with HH were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 3 (14%) were compound heterozygotes for mutations C282Y and H63D, and 2 patients (9%) did not exhibit either mutation. Screening of 458 control individuals from the general South African population demonstrated a carrier frequency of approximately 17% for the C282Y mutation among whites, implying that up to 1 out of every 115 South Africans of European descent may be homozygous for this founder-type mutation. Among 64 healthy blood donors of mixed ancestry, we detected 2 individuals heterozygous and 1 homozygous for the C282Y mutation. The detection of mutations C282Y and H63D at a high frequency in the majority of affected South African patients facilitates accurate pre-clinical and confirmatory diagnosis of HH in South Africa. Early detection by DNA screening and subsequent treatment by repeated phlebotomy can prevent disease onset in affected individuals. DNA diagnosis is particularly applicable to a common genetic disease such as HH, which is underdiagnosed and potentially lethal, but treatable.",

Mild to moderate iron overload is common in PCT, as iron is one of the factors which trigger the clinical manifestations of the disease through the inactivation of URO-D. A role for genetic hemochromatosis in the development of iron overload in sporadic PCT has been hypothesized in the past. The aim of this work was to investigate whether mutations of HFE, which is a candidate gene for hemochromatosis, play the role of genetic susceptibility factors for PCT in Italian patients, who have a high prevalence of acquired triggering factors, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection and alcohol. We determined HFE genotypes of 68 male patients with PCT. Our data do not confirm an association of PCT with the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation, strongly associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European countries. A second mutation of HFE, His63Asp, however, had a significantly increased frequency as it was present in half of the patients. Surprisingly, the presence of the His63Asp mutation was not related to the iron status of patients, suggesting that a subtle abnormality of iron metabolism induced by this mutation could escape detection by the standard parameters of iron status. In PCT patients with liver disease, the presence of the mutation could contribute to the inactivation of URO-D, either directly or through a synergistic action with other factors that cause liver damage.",

He lacks any other mutation in HFE or HJV, TFR2, HAMP and SLC40A1. The HFE mutation causes a frameshift (p.P160fs) that introduces a premature termination codon leading to mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated decay.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19146986": "Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage. The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE, a non-classical MHC class-I gene located in chromosome 6, whose role in the regulation of systemic iron metabolism is still not completely understood. Iron enhances the formation of reactive oxygen species, with increasing risk of DNA damage induced by oxidative stress, and consequently an increased susceptibility to chromosome instability. In the present work we examined spontaneous and diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced chromosome instability in PHA-stimulated lymphocyte cultures from 23 HH patients, all homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation, in comparison to 29 normal controls. In addition, three patients with secondary forms of iron overload, not related to HFE, were studied as controls to test the role of iron overload on DEB-induced chromosome instability. Our results show a significantly higher frequency of spontaneous chromosome breaks in lymphocytes from the HH patients, when compared with lymphocytes from normal controls (p&lt;0.0001). In addition, there is a significant correlation between the percentage of cells with spontaneous chromosomal breaks and the transferrin saturation (r=0.53, p=0.0041) or serum-ferritin levels (r=0.66, p=0.0001) in patients. Surprisingly, the frequency of DEB-induced chromosome breaks was significantly lower in lymphocytes from HH patients than in lymphocytes from both controls and patients with secondary forms of hemochromatosis (p=0.0029). No correlation was observed between the percentage of cells with DEB-induced chromosome breaks and the transferrin saturation or serum-ferritin values. These results suggest that lymphocytes from HH patients may have an increased capacity to respond to DEB-induced chromosome breakage, and that this capacity is somehow related to the presence of the C282Y HFE mutation.",

We developed mutant mouse strains to gain insight into the role of the Hfe/Tfr1 complex in regulating iron homeostasis. We introduced mutations into a ubiquitously expressed Tfr1 transgene or the endogenous Tfr1 locus to promote or prevent the Hfe/Tfr1 interaction. Under conditions favoring a constitutive Hfe/Tfr1 interaction, mice developed iron overload attributable to inappropriately low expression of the hormone hepcidin. In contrast, mice carrying a mutation that interferes with the Hfe/Tfr1 interaction developed iron deficiency associated with inappropriately high hepcidin expression. High-level expression of a liver-specific Hfe transgene in Hfe-/- mice was also associated with increased hepcidin production and iron deficiency. Together, these models suggest that Hfe induces hepcidin expression when it is not in complex with Tfr1.",

Here, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 41 patients from the S\u00e3o Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal), six belonging to a family with HH type-I pseudodominant inheritance, and 35 unrelated individuals fulfilling the biochemical criteria of iron overload compatible with HH type-I. For this purpose, we analyzed the most common HFE mutations- c.845G&gt;A [p.Cys282Tyr], c.187C&gt;G [p.His63Asp], and c.193A&gt;T [p.Ser65Cys]. Results revealed that the family's HH pseudodominant pattern is due to consanguineous marriage of HFE-c.845G&gt;A carriers, and to marriage with a genetically unrelated spouse that is a -c.187G carrier. Regarding unrelated patients, six were homozygous for c.845A, and three were c.845A/c.187G compound heterozygous. We then performed sequencing of HFE exons 2, 4, 5 and their intron-flanking regions. No other mutations were observed, but we identified the -c.340+4C [IVS2+4C] splice variant in 26 (74.3%) patients. Functionally, the c.340+4C may generate alternative splicing by HFE exon 2 skipping and consequently, a protein missing the \u03b11-domain essential for HFE/ transferrin receptor-1 interactions. Finally, we investigated HFE mutations configuration with iron overload by determining haplotypes and genotypic profiles. Results evidenced that carriers of HFE-c.187G allele also carry -c.340+4C, suggesting in-cis configuration. This data is corroborated by the association analysis where carriers of the complex allele HFE-c.[187C&gt;G;340+4T&gt;C] have an increased iron overload risk (RR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.40-2.94, p&lt;0.001). Therefore, homozygous for this complex allele are at risk of having iron overload because they will produce two altered proteins--the p.63Asp [c.187G], and the protein lacking 88 amino acids encoded by exon 2. In summary, we provide evidence that the complex allele HFE-c.[187C&gt;G;340+4T&gt;C] has a role, as genetic predisposition factor, on iron overload in the S\u00e3o Miguel population. Independent replication studies in other populations are needed to confirm this association.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20177050": "Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), transferrin-receptor 2 (TfR2), hemojuvelin, hepcidin, or ferroportin genes. Hepcidin is a key iron regulator, which is secreted by the liver, and decreases serum iron levels by causing the down-regulation of the iron transporter, ferroportin. Mutations in either HFE or TfR2 lower hepcidin levels, implying that both HFE and TfR2 are necessary for regulation of hepcidin expression. In this study, we used a recombinant adeno-associated virus, AAV2/8, for hepatocyte-specific expression of either Hfe or Tfr2 in mice. Expression of Hfe in Hfe-null mice both increased Hfe and hepcidin mRNA and lowered hepatic iron and Tf saturation. Expression of Tfr2 in Tfr2-deficient mice had a similar effect, whereas expression of Hfe in Tfr2-deficient mice or of Tfr2 in Hfe-null mice had no effect on liver or serum iron levels. Expression of Hfe in wild-type mice increased hepcidin mRNA and lowered iron levels. In contrast, expression of Tfr2 had no effect on wild-type mice. These findings suggest that Hfe is limiting in formation of the Hfe/Tfr2 complex that regulates hepcidin expression. In addition, these studies show that the use of recombinant AAV vector to deliver genes is a promising approach for studying physiologic consequences of protein complexes.",

The third method was a new PCR-based reverse hybridisation line probe assay (LiPA), comprising DNA amplification by general primers followed by a single step reverse hybridization to specific probes, immobilized on a nitrocellulose strip. Forty-eight (94%) of the 51 samples yielded identical results by all three methods. Three discrepant results were obtained, caused by polymorphisms in the primer binding region, resulting in no amplification at all or selective amplification, leading to misinterpretation of the HFE genotype by PCR-RFLP. The design of the assay and the stringency of the reaction conditions used are crucial to obtain a correct HFE genotype. PCR-LiPA offers an easy and reliable alternative to currently used conventional methods.",

Hereditary hemochromatosis, a common condition caused by HFE gene mutations, can lead to excess iron storage and disease but clinical penetrance of HFE gene mutations is low and many people with elevated iron stores lack HFE mutations. We analyzed data from the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study to assess the relationship among HFE genotype (individuals with either homozygous or compound heterozygous status for C282Y and/or H63D HFE mutations were defined as genotype positive, or G+), elevated iron phenotype (individuals exceeding gender-specific transferrin saturation and serum ferritin threshold levels were considered phenotype positive, or P+), and leukocyte telomere length, a marker of biological aging and cumulative oxidative stress. In unadjusted analyses in comparison to individuals who were G-P-, G+P- were not significantly different (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.26-2.04), while the G+P+ (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.15-3.56), and G-P+ (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.5-3.29) had increased risk of short telomeres (&lt;=25th percentile) rather than long telomeres (&gt;=75th percentile). In analyses adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, the effect of individuals with elevated iron phenotypes having short telomeres persisted with G+P+ individuals (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.02-3.72), and G-P+ individuals (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.39-3.39) being significantly different from the G-P- group. In conclusion, elevated iron phenotype, but not HFE genotype, was associated with shortened telomeres. Further studies will be needed to determine whether telomere length provides a marker for morbidities specifically associated with iron overload.",

It is known that about 85% of patients with inherent hemochromatosis are either homo-zygotic agents of mutation C282Y or carry compound-heterozygote C282Y/H63D. Therefore, the molecular genetic study intended for detection of these three mutations in gene HFE takes important place in diagnostic of inherent hemochromatosis. The study was organized to develop methods for detection of mutations C282Y, H63D, S65C on the basis of two molecular genetic methods - polymerase chain reaction in real-time and pyrosequenation. As reference method was used published method by Moyses C.B. et al. (2008). These methods were applied to analyzing 129 DNA samples. There were no discordant results. Among analyzed clinical DNA samples, mutant alleles of gene HFE were detected in 42 samples (32.5%)\u044e The mutation C282Y is detected in heterozygotic condition in 4 samples (3.1%); mutation H63D was detected in heterozygotic condition in 31 samples (24%) and in homo-zygotic condition in 4 samples (4%). The mutation S65C encountered in heterozygotic condition in one sample (0.8%) and in one sample compound-heterozygote H63D/S65C was detected (0.8%). The comparative characteristic of these three methods was made according the following parameters: time, number of analysis stages and convenience of interpretation of results. The main merit of method based on polymerase chain reaction in real-time is time of analysis implementation. The main merit of method based on pyrosequenation is automatic identification of genotype.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17255318": "Genetic iron overload, or hemochromatosis, can be caused by mutations in HFE, hemojuvelin, and hepcidin genes. Hepcidin, a negative regulator of intestinal iron absorption, is found to be inappropriately low in both patients and in animal models, indicating that proper control of basal hepcidin levels requires both hemojuvelin and HFE. In mice, repulsive guidance molecule c (Rgmc, the hemojuvelin mouse ortholog) and hepcidin levels are transcriptionally regulated during inflammation. Here, we report that basal Rgmc levels in Hfe-deficient mice are normal and that these mice retain the ability to suppress Rgmc expression after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Thus, Rgmc regulation by LPS is Hfe-independent. The response of Rgmc to LPS involves signaling through toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), because Tlr4-deficient mice do not show altered Rgmc expression after LPS administration. We further show that tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but not interleukin-6, is sufficient to cause Rgmc down-regulation by LPS. These results contrast with previous data demonstrating that hepcidin levels are directly regulated by interleukin-6 but not by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The regulation of iron-related genes by different cytokines may allow for time-dependent control of iron metabolism changes during inflammation and may be relevant to chronic inflammation, infections, and cancer settings, leading to the development of anemia of chronic disease.",

We measured the pre-phlebotomy plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in homozygotes for the C282Y mutation of HFE. There was no difference in these levels in subjects with high iron stores than in those with low iron stores, suggesting that the phenotypic differences between such homozygotes is not appreciably affected by ongoing chronic inflammation.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that iron accumulation may be a factor in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD retinas have more iron within the photoreceptors, RPE, and drusen than do age-matched control retinas. Accelerated AMD-like maculopathy develops in patients with retinal iron overload from the hereditary disease aceruloplasminemia. Mice with retinal iron overload resulting from knockout of ceruloplasmin and its homologue hephaestin exhibit retinal degeneration with some features of AMD, including subretinal neovascularization, accumulation of RPE lipofuscin and sub-RPE deposits, and RPE/photoreceptor death. Increased understanding of the mechanisms of retinal iron homeostasis may help in the development of therapies to prevent iron overload. For example, herein it is shown that one regulator of systemic iron homeostasis, HFE, is expressed in the RPE. Thus, patients with the common disease hereditary hemochromatosis, which is often caused by an HFE mutation, may have retinal iron overload predisposing to AMD. Preliminary data suggest that iron chelation can reduce RPE iron overload in mice and protect them from degeneration, suggesting that iron-binding drugs may one day prove useful in reducing RPE oxidative stress and decreasing the risk of AMD progression.",

New speculations have appeared on the possible relation of this role of iron and the occurrence of mutation of the recently discovered gene of the hereditary hemochromatosis HFE, which may cause the iron overloading of the organism. Our paper describes prevalence of the C282Y gene mutation (HFE) together with the clinical and laboratory record in PCT patients. PCT was diagnosed mostly on the basis of clinical finding of actinic-traumatic vesicular dermatitis and the typical laboratory record of elevated higher-carboxylic porphyrines in urine and stool. Other laboratory methods tested the liver functions, plasma iron level and its binding capacity, ferritine level. All patient underwent routine haematological testing. Presence of antibodies against hepatitis C was also assayed (Elisa test 2nd generation, Sanofi Pasteur). In patients with prominent laboratory alterations showing possibility of the hepatic structural lesion, histology from the liver punctate was done. Frequency data of the C282Y gene mutation (HFE) in PCT patients was estimated on the basis of the genetic testing using PCR reaction of our own system. Group of PCT patients had 69 persons (63 patients with the sporadic form and 6 patients with familiar form of the disease). Hereditary haemochromatosis C282Y gene mutation (HH) was found in 15 patients, three of them were homozygotes and twelve heterozygotes (three heterozygotes had the familiar form of the disease). Nobody in this group was positive in the HIV antibody testing. In all porphyria patients with the presence of mutated gene who underwent liver biopsy, siderosis of different degrees was identified. In three patients neither the phenotypic observation nor the laboratory testing have shown haemochromatosis. Prevalence of C282Y gene mutation HFE in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda was studied. Such mutation was found in 15 persons (12 heterozygotes and 3 homozygotes) from the group of 69 tested patients (21.7%). Such frequency is significantly higher than in the control--nonporphyric--persons (10%). Patients were without clinical symptoms. Laboratory haematological changes, typical for HH, manifested in some of them only (elevated level of ferritine was found in 10 from 15 porphyria patients, elevated sideremia in one of them). Red blood cell counts were in both homo- and heterozygotes normal. Concurrence of the two porphyrinogenic factors--presence of gene mutation HFE and hepatitis C infection--was not proved. Antibodies against hepatitis C virus were not identified in any of the patients. Siderosis was found to be only a symptomatic sign, which was pronounced in different degree in all 9 porphyria patients with C282Y gene mutation who underwent liver biopsy. Frequency of C282Y gene mutation in our patients with porphyria cutanea tarda appears similar to that in other Middle European countries. It differs significantly from the frequency found in South European and North European countries (British).",

Nevertheless, patients with an HH-like phenotype that remains completely/partially unexplained despite extensive sequencing of known genes are not infrequently seen at referral centers, suggesting a role of still unknown genetic factors. A compelling candidate is Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6 (BMP6), which acts as a major activator of the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the upregulation of hepcidin gene transcription. A recent seminal study by French authors has described three heterozygous missense mutations in BMP6 associated with mild to moderate late-onset iron overload (IO). Using an updated next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic test in IO patients negative for the classical HFE p.Cys282Tyr mutation, we found three BMP6 heterozygous missense mutations in four patients from three different families. One mutation (p.Leu96Pro) has already been described and proven to be functional. The other two (p.Glu112Gln, p.Arg257His) were novel, and both were located in the pro-peptide domain known to be crucial for appropriate BMP6 processing and secretion. In silico modeling also showed results consistent with their pathogenetic role. The patients' clinical phenotypes were similar to that of other patients with BMP6-related IO recently described. Our results independently add further evidence to the role of BMP6 mutations as likely contributing factors to late-onset moderate IO unrelated to mutations in the established five HH genes.",

Population studies of this polymorphism are facilitated by the fact that the Cys282Tyr mutation creates a Rsal restriction site. We have studied the codon 282 (Cys/Tyr) polymorphism in different ethnic groups. In agreement with previous observations the Tyr allele appeared to be rare or absent in Asiatic (Indian, Chinese) populations. The highest allele frequency (7.5%) was found in Swedes. Saamis (2%) and Mordvinians (1.8%) had significantly lower frequencies of the Tyr allele.

We present a patient with hyperferritinemia and iron overload, and facial flushing. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to measure hepatic iron overload, and a molecular study of the genes involved in iron metabolism was undertaken. The iron overload was similar to that observed in HFE hemochromatosis, and the patient was double heterozygous for two novel mutations, c.-20G&gt;A and c.718A&gt;G (p.K240E), in the HFE and ferroportin (FPN1 or SLC40A1) genes, respectively. Hyperferritinemia and facial flushing improved after phlebotomy. Two of the patient's children were also studied, and the daughter was heterozygous for the mutation in the SLC40A1 gene, although she did not have hyperferritinemia. The patient presented a mild iron overload phenotype probably because of the two novel mutations in the HFE and SLC40A1 genes.",

There are 2 main causes of iron overload: hereditary hemochromatosis which is a primary cause, is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations of genes that control iron metabolism and secondary hemochromatosis caused by multitransfusions, chronic hemolysis, and intake of iron rich food. The most common type of hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by HFE gene mutation. In this study, we analyzed iron metabolism in 100 healthy Polish children in relation to their HFE gene status. The wild-type HFE gene was predominant being observed in 60 children (60%). Twenty-five children (25%), presented with heterozygotic H63D mutation, and 15 children (15%), presented with other mutations (heterozygotic C282Y and S65C mutation, compound heterozygotes C282Y/S65C, C282Y/H63D, H63D homozygote). The mean concentration of iron, the level of ferritin, and transferrin saturation were statistically higher in the group of HFE variants compared with the wild-type group. H63D carriers presented with higher mean concentration of iron, ferritin levels, and transferrin saturation compared with the wild-type group. Male HFE carriers presented with higher iron concentration, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels than females.

Usually hemochromatosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Less common non-HFE-related forms of hemochromatosis have been reported and are caused by mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 gene and in a gene localized to chromosome 1q. Autosomal dominant forms of hemochromatosis have also been described. Recently, 2 mutations in the ferroportin1 gene, which encodes the iron transport protein ferroportin1, have been implicated in families with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis from the Netherlands and Italy. We report the finding of a novel mutation (V162del) in ferroportin1 in an Australian family with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis. We propose that this mutation disrupts the function of the ferroportin1 protein, leading to impaired iron homeostasis and iron overload.",

Non-HFE hemochromatoses have been divided into two subgroups with distinctive features. The first includes juvenile and TFR2-related hemochromatoses that, similar to HFE hemochromatosis, show recessive inheritance, increased transferrin saturation, iron storage in hepatocytes and responsiveness to phlebotomy. Disorders in this subgroup, although differing regarding the severity of iron overload and/or the age at presentation, are all either due to hepcidin deficiency or to the inability to increase hepcidin levels according to iron stores. The second subgroup of hemochromatosis is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the SLC40A1 gene encoding the iron exporter ferroportin with distinctive features. Iron loading of Kupffer cells and normal transferrin saturation characterize the so-called 'ferroportin disease'. In contrast, few mutations in SLC40A1 that cause hepcidin resistance lead to a hemochromatosis-like phenotype with dominant inheritance. The precise diagnosis of the genetic type of hemochromatosis is relevant for the follow-up, treatment, and for family counseling.",

HFE mutations result in reduced expression of hepcidin, a hepatic hormone, which negatively regulates iron absorption from the duodenum and iron release from macrophages. However, the mechanism by which HFE regulates hepcidin expression in hepatocytes is not well understood. It is known that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway plays a central role in controlling hepcidin expression in the liver. Here we show that HFE overexpression increased Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression, whereas inhibition of BMP signaling abolished HFE-induced hepcidin expression in Hep3B cells. HFE was found to associate with ALK3, inhibiting ALK3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and increasing ALK3 protein expression and accumulation on the cell surface. The 2 HFE mutants associated with HH, HFE C282Y and HFE H63D, regulated ALK3 protein ubiquitination and trafficking differently, but both failed to increase ALK3 cell-surface expression. Deletion of Hfe in mice resulted in a decrease in hepatic ALK3 protein expression. Our results provide evidence that HFE induces hepcidin expression via the BMP pathway: HFE interacts with ALK3 to stabilize ALK3 protein and increase ALK3 expression at the cell surface.",

HFE mutations are associated with impaired hepatic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling for hepcidin production. TMPRSS6, a transmembrane serine protease mutated in iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, inhibits hepcidin expression by dampening BMP/SMAD signaling. In the present study, we used genetic approaches in mice to examine the relationship between Hfe and Tmprss6 in the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis. Heterozygous loss of Tmprss6 in Hfe(-/-) mice reduced systemic iron overload, whereas homozygous loss caused systemic iron deficiency and elevated hepatic expression of hepcidin and other Bmp/Smad target genes. In contrast, neither genetic loss of Hfe nor hepatic Hfe overexpression modulated the hepcidin elevation and systemic iron deficiency of Tmprss6(-/-) mice. These results indicate that genetic loss of Tmprss6 increases Bmp/Smad signaling in an Hfe-independent manner that can restore Bmp/Smad signaling in Hfe(-/-) mice. Furthermore, these results suggest that natural genetic variation in the human ortholog TMPRSS6 might modify the clinical penetrance of HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis, raising the possibility that pharmacologic inhibition of TMPRSS6 could attenuate iron loading in this disorder.",

The presence of mutations in the superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) has led to theories regarding a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of this disease. A primary cause of oxidative stress is perturbations in cellular iron homeostasis. Cellular iron mismanagement and oxidative stress are associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. One mechanism by which cells fail to properly regulate their iron status is through a mutation in the Hfe gene. Mutations in the Hfe gene are associated with the iron overload disease, hemochromatosis. In the current study, 31% of patients with sporadic ALS carried a mutation in the Hfe gene, compared to only 14% of patients without identifiable neuromuscular disease, or with neuromuscular diseases other than ALS (p&lt;0.005). To determine the cellular consequences of carrying an Hfe mutation, a human neuronal cell line was transfected with genes carrying the Hfe mutation. The presence of the Hfe mutation disrupted expression of tubulin and actin at the protein levels potentially consistent with the disruption of axonal transport seen in ALS and was also associated with a decrease in CuZnSOD1 expression. These data provide compelling evidence for a role for the Hfe mutation in etiopathogenesis of ALS and warrant further investigation.",

However, conflicting results were obtained in previous studies aimed to verify if nucleotide variations in HFE gene act as risk modifiers for PD. We used denaturing HPLC for scanning DNA sequence variations in exon 2 and 4 of HFE gene in a cohort of 475 Italian PD patients. We identified the most common H63D, C282Y and S65C, and also other 4 rare mutation types (R66H, R224W, E277K, and T281M). The allele frequency of H63D and C282Y was not statistically different from that of 2 control groups with similar mean age or of a large cohort of the same geographical area. In addition we could not find statistical differences in the clinical phenotypes of patients carrying at least one mutated HFE allele from those with the normal allele.

Genetic hemochromatosis now corresponds to six diseases, namely classical hemochromatosis HFE 1; juvenile hemochromatosis HFE 2 due to mutations in an unidentified gene on chromosome 1; hemochromatosis HFE 3 due to mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2); hemochromatosis HFE 4 caused by a mutation in the H subunit of ferritin; and hemochromatosis HFE 6 whose gene is hepcidine (HAMP). Systemic iron overload is also associated with aceruloplasminemia, atransferrinemia and the \"Gracile\" syndrome caused by mutations in BCS1L. The genes responsible for neonatal and African forms of iron overload are unknown. Other genetic diseases are due to localized iron overload: Friedreich's ataxia results from the expansion of triple nucleotide repeats within the frataxin (FRDA) gene; two forms of X-linked sideroblastic anemia are due to mutations within the delta aminolevulinate synthetase (ALAS 2) or ABC-7 genes; Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is caused by a pantothenate kinase 2 gene (PANK-2) defect; neuroferritinopathies; and hyperferritinemia--cataract syndrome due to a mutation within the L-ferritin gene. In addition to this wide range of genetic abnormalities, two other features characterize these iron disorders: 1) most are transmitted by an autosomal recessive mechanism, but some, including hemochromatosis type 4, have dominant transmission; and 2) most correspond to cytosolic iron accumulation while some, like Friedreich's ataxia, are disorders of mitochondrial metabolism.",

Elevated iron storage is associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity, and all of them are associated with HTG. The aim of the study was to analyze whether HFE mutations causing hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are associated with primary HTG. Genetic predisposition to HH was analyzed in a case-control study. The study was conducted at University Hospital Lipid Clinic. We studied two groups: 1) the HTG group, composed of 208 patients; and 2) the control group, composed of 215 normolipemic subjects and 161 familial hypercholesterolemia patients. Two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were analyzed. We measured HH genetic predisposition difference between groups. HH genetic predisposition was 5.9 and 4.4 times higher in the HTG group than in the normolipemic (P = 0.02) and FH (P = 0.05) subjects, respectively. There were 35 cases (16.8%) of iron overload in the primary HTG group, 14 (6.5%) and nine (5.6%) in the normolipidemic and FH groups, respectively. A higher HH genetic predisposition and a different prevalence of iron overload in subjects with HH genetic predisposition among groups contributed to this higher prevalence. None of the four cases with the HFE genotype associated with high risk of HH in the control groups presented iron overload; however, in eight of 11 subjects (72.7%) with primary HTG and HH genetic predisposition, the iron overload was present. Mutations in HFE gene, favoring iron overload and causing HH, could play an important role in the development of several phenotypes of primary HTG.",

C. elegans, however, engages in polycistronic transcription of operons in which 3' end formation between genes is not accompanied by termination. We have performed RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and CstF ChIP-seq experiments to investigate at a genome-wide level how RNAPII can transcribe through multiple poly-A signals without causing termination. Our data shows that transcription proceeds in some ways as if operons were composed of multiple adjacent single genes. Total RNAPII shows a small peak at the promoter of the gene cluster and a much larger peak at 3' ends. These 3' peaks coincide with maximal phosphorylation of Ser2 within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII and maximal localization of the 3' end formation factor CstF. This pattern occurs at all 3' ends including those at internal sites in operons where termination does not occur. Thus the normal mechanism of 3' end formation does not always result in transcription termination. Furthermore, reduction of CstF50 by RNAi did not substantially alter the pattern of CstF64, total RNAPII, or Ser2 phosphorylation at either internal or terminal 3' ends. However, CstF50 RNAi did result in a subtle reduction of CstF64 binding upstream of the site of 3' cleavage, suggesting that the CstF50/CTD interaction may facilitate bringing the 3' end machinery to the transcription complex.",

Trans-splicing also occurs at monocistronic transcripts. The phlyogenetically sporadic appearance of trans-splicing and operons has made the driving force(s) for their evolution in metazoans unclear. Previous work has proposed that germline expression drives operon organization in Caenorhabditis elegans, and a recent hypothesis proposes that operons provide an evolutionary advantage via the conservation of transcriptional machinery during recovery from growth arrested states. Using a modified cap analysis of gene expression protocol we mapped sites of SL trans-splicing genome-wide in the marine chordate Oikopleura dioica. Tiled microarrays revealed the expression dynamics of trans-spliced genes across development and during recovery from growth arrest. Operons did not facilitate recovery from growth arrest in O. dioica. Instead, we found that trans-spliced transcripts were predominantly maternal. We then analyzed data from C. elegans and Ciona intestinalis and found that an enrichment of trans-splicing and operon gene expression in maternal mRNA is shared between all three species, suggesting that this may be a driving force for operon evolution in metazoans. Furthermore, we found that the majority of known terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs are trans-spliced in O. dioica and that the SL contains a TOP-like motif. This suggests that the SL in O. dioica confers nutrient-dependent translational control to trans-spliced mRNAs via the TOR-signaling pathway. We hypothesize that SL-trans-splicing provides an evolutionary advantage in species that depend on translational control for regulating early embryogenesis, growth and oocyte production in response to nutrient levels.",

Operons are present in the class Chromadorea, one of the two main nematode classes, but their distribution in the other class, the Enoplea, is not known. We have surveyed the genomes of Trichinella spiralis, Trichuris muris, and Romanomermis culicivorax and identified the first putative operons in members of the Enoplea. Consistent with the mechanism of polycistronic RNA resolution in other nematodes, the mRNAs produced by genes downstream of the first gene in the T. spiralis and T. muris operons are trans-spliced to spliced leader RNAs, and we are able to detect polycistronic RNAs derived from these operons. Importantly, a putative intercistronic region from one of these potential enoplean operons confers polycistronic processing activity when expressed as part of a chimeric operon in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that T. spiralis genes located in operons have an increased likelihood of having operonic C. elegans homologs. However, operon structure in terms of synteny and gene content is not tightly conserved between the two taxa, consistent with models of operon evolution. We have nevertheless identified putative operons conserved between Enoplea and Chromadorea. Our data suggest that operons and \"spliced leader\" (SL) trans-splicing predate the radiation of the nematode phylum, an inference which is supported by the phylogenetic profile of proteins known to be involved in nematode SL trans-splicing.",

To see whether the content or organization of operons serves similar roles across species, we experimentally defined operons in the nematode model Pristionchus pacificus. We performed affinity capture experiments on mRNA pools to specifically enrich for transcripts that are trans-spliced to either the SL1- or SL2-spliced leader, using spliced leader-specific probes. We obtained distinct trans-splicing patterns from the analysis of three mRNA pools (total mRNA, SL1 and SL2 fraction) by RNA-seq. This information was combined with a genome-wide analysis of gene orientation and spacing. We could confirm 2219 operons by RNA-seq data out of 6709 candidate operons, which were predicted by sequence information alone. Our gene order comparison of the Caenorhabditis elegans and P. pacificus genomes shows major changes in operon organization in the two species. Notably, only 128 out of 1288 operons in C. elegans are conserved in P. pacificus. However, analysis of gene-expression profiles identified conserved functions such as an enrichment of germline-expressed genes and higher expression levels of operonic genes during recovery from dauer arrest in both species. These results provide support for the model that a necessity for increased transcriptional efficiency in the context of certain developmental processes could be a selective constraint for operon evolution in metazoans. Our method is generally applicable to other metazoans to see if similar functional constraints regulate gene organization into operons.",

SL1 is used to trim off the 5' ends of pre-mRNAs and replace them with the SL1 sequence. This processing event is very closely related to cis-splicing, or intron removal. The SL1 sequence is donated by a 100 nt small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), the SL1 snRNP. This snRNP is structurally and functionally similar to the U snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) that play key roles in intron removal and trans-splicing, except that the SL1 snRNP is consumed in the process. More than half of C. elegans pre-mRNAs are subject to SL1 trans-splicing, whereas ~30% are not trans-spliced. The remaining genes are trans-spliced by SL2, which is donated by a similar snRNP, the SL2 snRNP. SL2 recipients are all downstream genes in closely spaced gene clusters similar to bacterial operons. They are transcribed from a promoter at the 5' end of the cluster of between 2 and 8 genes. This transcription makes a polycistronic pre-mRNA that is co-transcriptionally processed by cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3' end of each gene, and this event is closely coupled to the SL2 trans-splicing event that occurs only ~100 nt further downstream. SL2 trans-splicing requires a sequence between the genes, the Ur element, that likely base pairs with the 5' splice site on the SL2 snRNP, in a manner analogous to the interaction between the 5' splice site in cis-splicing with the U1 snRNP. The key difference is that in trans-splicing, the snRNP contains the 5' splice site, whereas in cis-splicing the pre-mRNA does. Some operons, termed \"hybrid operons\", contain an additional promoter between two genes that can express the downstream gene or genes with a developmental profile that is different from that of the entire operon. The operons contain primarily genes required for rapid growth, including genes whose products are needed for mitochondrial function and the basic machinery of gene expression. Recent evidence suggests that RNA polymerase is poised at the promoters of growth genes, and operons allow more efficient recovery from growth-arrested states, resulting in reduction in the need for this cache of inactive RNA polymerase.",

We analyzed the number of transcript isoforms of Caenorhabditis elegans operonic genes and found that C. elegans operons contain a much higher proportion of genes with multiple transcript isoforms than non-operonic genes do. For genes that express multiple transcript isoforms, there is no apparent difference between the number of isoforms in operonic and non-operonic genes. C. elegans operonic genes also have a different preference of the 20 most common 3' splice sites compared to non-operonic genes.

It is unclear how operons have become abundant in nematode genomes. The \"one-way street\" hypothesis asserts that once formed by chance, operons are very difficult to break, because the breakage would leave downstream genes in an operon without a promoter, and hence, unexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C. elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as outgroups, and identified numerous operon gains and losses. Coupled with experimental examination of trans-splicing patterns, our comparative genomic analysis revealed diverse molecular mechanisms of operon losses, including inversion, insertion, and relocation, but the presence of internal promoters was not found to facilitate operon losses. In several cases, the data allowed inference of mechanisms by which downstream genes are expressed after operon breakage. We found that the rate of operon gain is approximately 3.3 times that of operon loss. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of nematode operons is better described as \"easy come, slow go,\" rather than a \"one-way street.\" Based on a mathematic model of operon gains and losses and additional assumptions, we projected that the number of operons in C. elegans will continue to rise by 6%-18% in future evolution before reaching equilibrium between operon gains and losses.",

We have termed these operons \"hybrid operons.\" GFP expression patterns driven from internal promoters differ in tissue specificity from expression of operon promoters, and serial analysis of gene expression data reveals that there is a lack of expression correlation between genes in many hybrid operons. The average length of intergenic regions with putative promoter activity in hybrid operons is larger than previous estimates for operons as a whole. Genes with internal promoters are more commonly involved in gene duplications and have a significantly lower incidence of alternative splicing than genes without internal promoters, although we have observed almost all trans-splicing patterns in these two distinct groups. Finally, internal promoter constructs are able to rescue lethal knockout phenotypes, demonstrating their necessity in gene regulation and survival.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9781873": "A new measure for assessing codon bias of one group of genes with respect to a second group of genes is introduced. In this formulation, codon bias correlations for Escherichia coli genes are evaluated for level of expression, for contrasts along genes, for genes in different 200 kb (or longer) contigs around the genome, for effects of gene size, for variation over different function classes, for codon bias in relation to possible lateral transfer and for dicodon bias for some gene classes. Among the function classes, codon biases of ribosomal proteins are the most deviant from the codon frequencies of the average E. coli gene. Other classes of 'highly expressed genes' (e.g. amino acyl tRNA synthetases, chaperonins, modification genes essential to translation activities) show less extreme codon biases. Consistently for genes with experimentally determined expression rates in the exponential growth phase, those of highest molar abundances are more deviant from the average gene codon frequencies and are more similar in codon frequencies to the average ribosomal protein gene. Independent of gene size, the codon biases in the 5' third of genes deviate by more than a factor of two from those in the middle and 3' thirds. In this context, there appear to be conflicting selection pressures imposed by the constraints of ribosomal binding, or more generally the early phase of protein synthesis (about the first 50 codons) may be more biased than the complete nascent polypeptide. In partitioning the E. coli genome into 10 equal lengths, pronounced differences in codon site 3 G+C frequencies accumulate. Genes near to oriC have 5% greater codon site 3 G+C frequencies than do genes from the ter region. This difference also is observed between small (100-300 codons) and large (&gt;800 codons) genes. This result contrasts with that for eukaryotic genomes (including human, Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast) where long genes tend to have site 3 more AT rich than short genes. Many of the above results are special for E. coli genes and do not apply to genes of most bacterial genomes. A gene is defined as alien (possibly horizontally transferred) if its codon bias relative to the average gene exceeds a high threshold and the codon bias relative to ribosomal proteins is also appropriately high.

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B cells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven functional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the enhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent autoimmune syndromes.",

In this review we will discuss the role of the X chromosome encoded toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) in the development of autoimmunity.

Sex-based differences in the innate function of human pDCs have been established, with pDCs from women exhibiting enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-\u03b1 production as compared with pDCs from males. In mice, we recently provided evidence for a role of estrogens as a positive regulator of pDC innate functions through cell-intrinsic estrogen receptor \u03b1 signaling, but did not exclude a role for other X-linked factors, particularly in human pDCs. In this study, we investigated the respective contribution of X chromosome dosage and sex hormones using a humanized mouse model in which male or female NOD-SCID-\u03b22m(-/-) were transplanted with human progenitor cells purified from either male or female cord blood cells. We showed that, in response to TLR7 ligands, the frequency of IFN-\u03b1- and TNF-\u03b1-producing pDCs from either sex was greater in female than in male host mice, suggesting a positive role for estrogens. Indeed, blockade of estrogen receptor signaling during pDC development in vitro inhibited TLR7-mediated IFN-\u03b1 production by human pDCs, which expressed both ESR1 and ESR2 genes. Interestingly, we also found that X chromosome dosage contributed to this sex bias as female pDCs have an enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-\u03b1 response as compared with male ones, irrespective of the sex of the recipient mice. Together, these results indicate that female sex hormones, estrogens, and X chromosome complement independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-\u03b1 response of pDCs in women.",

A recent multicenter study in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants, identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population. A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the TLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274 healthy female controls. In addition to rs3853839, two SNPs in intron 2, rs179019 and rs179010, which were in moderate linkage disequilibrium with each other (r2 = 0.53), showed an association with SLE (rs179019: P = 0.016, odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.15 to 3.54; rs179010: P = 0.018, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.80 (both under the recessive model)). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that the association of the intronic SNPs and the 3' UTR SNP remained significant after we adjusted them for each other. When only the patients and controls carrying the risk genotypes at the 3' UTR SNP position were analyzed, the risk of SLE was significantly increased when the individuals also carried the risk genotypes at both of the intronic SNPs (P = 0.0043, OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.60). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the intronic risk alleles in addition to the 3' UTR risk allele was associated with SLE under the recessive model (P = 0.016, OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.80), but other haplotypes were not associated with SLE. The TLR7 intronic SNPs rs179019 and rs179010 are associated with SLE independently of the 3' UTR SNP rs3853839 in Japanese women. Our findings support a role of TLR7 in predisposition for SLE in Asian populations.",

We and others recently demonstrated that the translocation of a cluster of X-linked genes onto the Y chromosome is the genetic lesion underlying Yaa (Subramanian, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2006. 103: 9970-9975; Pisitkun, P. et al., Science 2006. 312: 1669-1672). In male mice carrying Yaa, the transcription of several genes within the translocated segment is increased roughly twofold. Although the translocated X chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. To confirm the role of TLR7 in Yaa-mediated autoimmune phenotypes, we introgressed a targeted disruption of TLR7 (TLR7(-)) onto B6.Sle1Yaa to produce B6.Sle1YaaTLR7(-) and examined evidence of disease at 6 and 9 months of age. Our results demonstrate that the up-regulation of TLR7 in the B6.Sle1Yaa strain is responsible for splenomegaly, glomerular nephritis and the majority of the cellular abnormalities of B, T and myeloid cells. The up-regulation of TLR7 was also responsible for driving the infiltration and activation of leukocytes in the kidney, in which activated T cells were a primary component. However, the resolution of TLR7 up-regulation did not eliminate the enhanced humoral autoimmunity observed in B6.SleYaa, suggesting that additional elements in the translocation may contribute to the disease phenotype.",

By genome scanning, evidence of linkage between chromosome Xp22 and asthma and related atopic disorders has previously been obtained. Xp22 harbours the TLR7 and TLR8 genes. The involvement of TLR7 and TLR8 in the aetiology of asthma and related disorders was investigated by a family based association analysis of two independently ascertained family samples comprising 540 and 424 individuals from 135 and 100 families, respectively. Ten affected individuals from families showing evidence of linkage to Xp22 were screened for sequence variations in TLR7 and 8, and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were tested for association. In both samples, significant associations were observed for single SNPs and haplotypes of both TLR7 and 8 in all four phenotypes investigated: asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and increased specific IgE. The most significant association was seen for rs2407992 (TLR8) in asthma (p = 0.00023, sample A and B combined, recessive model). In TLR7, rs179008 showed the strongest association. Both rs179008 and rs2407992 are of putative functional significance, potentially affecting TLR7 processing and TLR8 splicing, respectively. Haplotypes comprising the major alleles of these two SNPs were overtransmitted to the affected offspring (eg, p = 0.00012 in asthma, combined sample, additive model). The results provide strong evidence that TLR7 and 8 may confer susceptibility to asthma and related atopic disorders and highlight these receptors as interesting targets for individualised, causally directed treatment.",

Its incidence is rapidly increasing, and early diagnosis is the main factor able to improve its poor prognosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins that recognize pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, against which TLRs activate the innate immune response and initiate the adaptive immune response. Genetic variations of these receptors may alter the immune system, and are involved in evolution and susceptibility to various diseases, including cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the presence of TLR7 glutamine (Gln) 11 leucine (Leu) polymorphism confers an increased susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma. For that purpose, a case-control study was performed with 182 melanoma cases and 89 controls. To highlight the possible association between the aforementioned polymorphism and the susceptibility to melanoma, 93 cases of single melanoma and 89 cases of multiple primary melanoma (MPM) were compared in the present study. Since the TLR7 gene is localized on the chromosome X, the allelic frequency of the Gln11Leu polymorphism was analyzed separately in males and females. The distribution of allele frequencies between melanoma cases and controls (P=0.245) and between single melanoma and MPM cases (P=0.482) was not significant. Therefore, the present results do not suggest an association between TLR7 Gln11Leu polymorphism and susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma. Further studies are required to analyze the influence of other TLR polymorphisms on the susceptibility to malignant melanoma and the involvement of innate immunity in this malignancy.",

The second stage included another set of 578 BD patients and 1000 healthy controls. The frequencies of TLR gene copy number types (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9, TLR10) were compared among patients and controls by using the \u03c7(2) test. Real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA expression from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy controls following stimulation with the TLR7 agonist R848. Levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b2 in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. All TLRs tested, except for TLR7, had a gene copy number of two in more than 98% of individuals tested. In the first stage, we found a significantly increased frequency of more than one copy of TLR7 (located on the X chromosome) in male BD patients and more than two copies in female patients (correction of P value [PC] = 0.021; PC = 0.048, respectively). A second stage and combined study confirmed the association (PC = 1.14 \u00d7 10(-6); PC = 9.12 \u00d7 10(-5), respectively). TLR7 mRNA expression in PBMCs was increased in healthy male carriers having more than one copy of TLR7 or females having more than two copies following stimulation with R848 (P = 0.021, P = 0.006, respectively). No effect of the various TLR7 copies on the release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b2 could be detected.

Recently, the Yaa mutation was identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study, we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete, because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis, which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover, we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X chromosome.",

TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the <i>TLR7</i> gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of <i>TLR7</i> allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express <i>TLR7</i> on both X chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater <i>TLR7</i> transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of CD27<sup>+</sup> plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. <i>TLR7</i> escape from X inactivation endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands.

In contrast, HMG1/2 cannot bind to the nucleosomes reconstitutedin vitro with the HS2core DNA sequence. These results indicate that the binding patterns between HMG proteins and the HS2core DNA sequence which exists in different states (the naked DNA or thein vitro reconstituted nucleosomal DNA) are quite different.

The functional mechanism by which the beta-globin LCR stimulates transcription of the linked beta-like globin genes remains unknown. The LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (5'HSs) that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors. These HSs are conserved among mammals, bind transcription factors that also bind to other parts of the locus, and compose the functional components of the LCR. To test the hypothesis that individual HSs have unique properties, homologous recombination was used to construct 5 lines of mice with individual deletions of each of the 5'HSs of the endogenous murine beta-globin LCR. Here it is reported that deletion of 5'HS1 reduces expression of the linked genes by up to 24%, while deletion of 5'HS4 leads to reductions of up to 27%. These deletions do not perturb the normal stage-specific expression of genes from this multigenic locus. In conjunction with previous studies of deletions of the other HSs and studies of deletion of the entire LCR, it is concluded that (1) none of the 5'HSs is essential for nearly normal expression; (2) none of the HSs is required for proper developmental expression; and (3) the HSs do not appear to synergize either structurally or functionally, but rather form independently and appear to contribute additively to the overall expression from the locus.",

The underlying mechanisms of this complex regulation have not yet been elucidated in detail. In the present report we investigate a possible link between chromatin structure and tissue-specific regulation of the bovine Cyp19 gene. We analysed the DNA methylation status and mapped DNaseI hypersensitive sites in the region encompassing the Cyp19 promoter 1.1 (P1.1) which controls Cyp19 expression in the bovine placenta. We show that P1.1 is hypomethylated in placental cotyledons (foetal layer) whereas it is methylated in placental caruncles (maternal layer), testis and corpus luteum. Furthermore, two placenta-specific DNaseI hypersensitive sites, HS1 and HS2, were observed within P1.1. Both DNA hypomethylation and the presence of DNaseI hypersensitive sites correlate with transcriptional activity of P1.1. Sequence analysis of hypersensitive sites revealed potential cis-regulatory elements, an E-box in HS1 and a trophoblast-specific element-like sequence in HS2. It could be demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that both sequence motifs are specific targets for placenta-derived nuclear factors. In conclusion, observed tissue-specific differences of the chromatin structure which correlate with tissue-specific promoter activity suggest that chromatin might be an important regulator of aromatase expression in cattle.",

Hypersensitive sites are located well upstream (over lkb) of the pre-ribosomal RNA promoter. Sequencing of the hypersensitive region in borealis rDNA, however, shows extensive homology with the promoter sequence, and with the hypersensitive region in X. laevis. Of two promoter-like duplications in each spacer, only the most upstream copy is associated with hypersensitivity to DNAaseI. Unlike DNAaseI, Endo R. MspI digests the rDNA of laevis blood nuclei at a domain extending downstream from the hypersensitive site to near the 40S promoter.

The LCR encompasses 5 major HSs, each of which is highly homologous among humans, mice, and other mammals. To analyze the function of individual HSs in the endogenous murine beta-globin LCR, we have used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to produce 5 mouse lines, each of which is deficient for 1 of these major HSs. In this report, we demonstrate that deletion of the conserved region of 5'HS 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5/6 abolishes HS formation at the deletion site but has no influence on the formation of the remaining HSs in the LCR. Therefore, in the endogenous murine locus, there is no dominant or initiating site whose formation must precede the formation of the other HSs. This is consistent with the idea that HSs form autonomously. We discuss the implications of these findings for current models of beta-globin regulation.",

Peaks in ACS density paralleled the distribution of DNaseI HSs.

Human genome TEs were found to contribute substantially to HS regulatory sequences characterized in CD4+ T cells: 23% of HS sites contain TE-derived sequences. While HS sites are far more evolutionarily conserved than non HS sites in the human genome, consistent with their functional importance, TE-derived HS sites are highly divergent. Nevertheless, TE-derived HS sites were shown to be functionally relevant in terms of driving gene expression in CD4+ T cells. Genes involved in immune response are statistically over-represented among genes with TE-derived HS sites. A number of genes with both TE-derived HS sites and immune tissue related expression patterns were found to encode proteins involved in immune response such as T cell specific receptor antigens and secreted cytokines as well as proteins with clinical relevance to HIV and cancer. Genes with TE-derived HS sites have higher average levels of sequence and expression divergence between human and mouse orthologs compared to genes with non TE-derived HS sites.

However, currently available methods are either time consuming and laborious, expensive or require large numbers of cells. We aimed to develop a quick and straightforward method for the analysis of DNaseI hypersensitive sites that overcomes these problems. We have developed a modified Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) approach for the identification and analysis of genomic regulatory regions. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by simultaneously analysing 20 loci from the ENCODE project for DNaseI hypersensitivity in a range of different cell lines. We were able to obtain reproducible results with as little as 5 x 10(4) cells per DNaseI treatment. Our results broadly matched those previously reported by the ENCODE project, and both technical and biological replicates showed high correlations, indicating the sensitivity and reproducibility of this method. This new method will considerably facilitate the identification and analysis of DNaseI hypersensitive sites. Due to the multiplexing potential of MLPA (up to 50 loci can be examined) it is possible to analyse dozens of DNaseI hypersensitive sites in a single reaction. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of MLPA means that fewer than 10(5) cells per DNaseI treatment can be used, allowing the discovery and analysis of tissue specific regulatory regions without the need for pooling. This method is quick and easy and results can be obtained within 48 hours after harvesting of cells or tissues. As no special equipment is required, this method can be applied by any laboratory interested in the analysis of DNaseI hypersensitive regions.",

To this end, we have performed global meta-analysis of the relationship among data from DNaseI-seq, ChIP-seq and expression arrays, and found that specific correlations exist among regulatory elements and gene expression across different cell types. These correlations revealed four distinct modes of chromatin domain structure reflecting different functions: repressive, active, primed and bivalent. Furthermore, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites were identified based on these integrative data. Our findings uncovered a complex regulatory process involving by DNaseI HS sites and histone modifications, and suggest that these dynamic elements may be responsible for maintaining chromatin structure and integrity of the human genome.

A number of such sites were found in several cell types, but none of these was detectable in a gene which was shown to be transcriptionally silent by the criterion of elongation of nascent transcripts in isolated nuclei. These results differ from those of a previous study, in which a DNaseI-hypersensitive site approximately 2 kb upstream of the gene was proposed to be associated with negative regulation of c-myc transcription in human cells. An analysis of DNA sequences presented here reveals that this region is highly homologous between mouse and human, suggesting that these upstream hypersensitive sites do not reflect species-specific regulatory elements. We also present data indicating that this hypersensitive site distinguishes the c-myc alleles in translocation-positive plasma cell tumors which lack c-myc rearrangement. Furthermore, we report the existence of hypersensitive sites within the gene. One of these appears to be associated with cryptic promoters that are employed only when the normal promoters are lost as a consequence of chromosome translocation. These results are discussed in the context of c-myc translocation and gene breakage and with respect to possible stage-specific regulation of the gene's transcriptional competence.",

These DH sites were observed in nuclei from transcriptionally active liver-derived HepG2 cells, but were absent from transcriptionally inactive HeLa cell nuclei. Several nuclear protein binding sites were detected in the DNaseI-hypersensitive region by DNaseI footprinting with HepG2 nuclear extracts, representing putative binding sites for the liver-specific activators. The locations of binding sites for these transcription factors were revealed via computer analysis of the DNA sequence of this region against a transcription factor database. Many micrococcal nuclease hypersensitive (MH) sites were also observed in nuclei from HepG2 cells but not in HeLa cell nuclei, implying that in hepatic cells, nucleosomes are either absent or have been displaced from this region by the liver-specific transcriptional activators, as inferred by the correspondence between the DH sites, the MH sites and the footprints.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22761590": "Understanding the molecular basis for phenotypic differences between humans and other primates remains an outstanding challenge. Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA that alter gene expression have been hypothesized as a key driver of these phenotypic differences. This has been supported by differential gene expression analyses in general, but not by the identification of specific regulatory elements responsible for changes in transcription and phenotype. To identify the genetic source of regulatory differences, we mapped DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) sites, which mark all types of active gene regulatory elements, genome-wide in the same cell type isolated from human, chimpanzee, and macaque. Most DHS sites were conserved among all three species, as expected based on their central role in regulating transcription. However, we found evidence that several hundred DHS sites were gained or lost on the lineages leading to modern human and chimpanzee. Species-specific DHS site gains are enriched near differentially expressed genes, are positively correlated with increased transcription, show evidence of branch-specific positive selection, and overlap with active chromatin marks. Species-specific sequence differences in transcription factor motifs found within these DHS sites are linked with species-specific changes in chromatin accessibility. Together, these indicate that the regulatory elements identified here are genetic contributors to transcriptional and phenotypic differences among primate species.",

Insulator elements have been proposed to modulate the communication between regulatory elements and promoters due to their ability to insulate genes from regulatory elements or to take part in long-distance interactions. Using a high-resolution chromatin conformation capture (H3C) method, we show that the Drosophila gypsy insulator behaves as a conformational chromatin border that is able to prohibit contacts between a Polycomb response element (PRE) and a distal promoter. On the other hand, two spaced gypsy elements form a chromatin loop that is able to bring an upstream PRE in contact with a downstream gene to mediate its repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) profiles of the Polycomb protein and its associated H3K27me3 histone mark reflect this insulator-dependent chromatin conformation, suggesting that Polycomb action at a distance can be organized by local chromatin topology.",

Using allelic regulation of mouse insulin-like growth factor II (Igf2) as a model, we demonstrate that CTCF binds to the unmethylated maternal allele of the imprinting control region (ICR) in the Igf2/H19 imprinting domain and forms a long-range intrachromosomal loop to interact with the three clustered Igf2 promoters. Polycomb repressive complex 2 is recruited through the interaction of CTCF with Suz12, leading to allele-specific methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3-K27) and to suppression of the maternal Igf2 promoters. Targeted mutation or deletion of the maternal ICR abolishes this chromatin loop, decreases allelic H3-K27 methylation, and causes loss of Igf2 imprinting. RNA interference knockdown of Suz12 also leads to reactivation of the maternal Igf2 allele and biallelic Igf2 expression. CTCF and Suz12 are coprecipitated from nuclear extracts with antibodies specific for either protein, and they interact with each other in a two-hybrid system. These findings offer insight into general epigenetic mechanisms by which CTCF governs gene expression by orchestrating chromatin loop structures and by serving as a DNA-binding protein scaffold to recruit and bind polycomb repressive complexes.",

We show that a large region upstream ( approximately 30 kb) of and extending approximately 60 kb around one such gene, GATA-4, is organized-in Tera-2 undifferentiated embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells-in a topologically complex multi-loop conformation that is formed by multiple internal long-range contact regions near areas enriched for EZH2, other PcG proteins, and the signature PcG histone mark, H3K27me3. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of EZH2 in undifferentiated Tera-2 cells leads to a significant reduction in the frequency of long-range associations at the GATA-4 locus, seemingly dependent on affecting the H3K27me3 enrichments around those chromatin regions, accompanied by a modest increase in GATA-4 transcription. The chromatin loops completely dissolve, accompanied by loss of PcG proteins and H3K27me3 marks, when Tera-2 cells receive differentiation signals which induce a approximately 60-fold increase in GATA-4 expression. In colon cancer cells, however, the frequency of the long-range interactions are increased in a setting where GATA-4 has no basal transcription and the loops encompass multiple, abnormally DNA hypermethylated CpG islands, and the methyl-cytosine binding protein MBD2 is localized to these CpG islands, including ones near the gene promoter. Removing DNA methylation through genetic disruption of DNA methyltransferases (DKO cells) leads to loss of MBD2 occupancy and to a decrease in the frequency of long-range contacts, such that these now more resemble those in undifferentiated Tera-2 cells. Our findings reveal unexpected similarities in higher order chromatin conformation between stem/precursor cells and adult cancers. We also provide novel insight that PcG-occupied and H3K27me3-enriched regions can form chromatin loops and physically interact in cis around a single gene in mammalian cells. The loops associate with a poised, low transcription state in EC cells and, with the addition of DNA methylation, completely repressed transcription in adult cancer cells.",

Whereas most loop boundaries or \"anchors\" are associated with CTCF protein in mammals, loop anchors in <i>Drosophila</i> were found most often in association with the polycomb group (PcG) protein Polycomb (Pc), a subunit of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Loops were frequently located within domains of PcG-repressed chromatin. Promoters located at PRC1 loop anchors regulate some of the most important developmental genes and are less likely to be expressed than those not at PRC1 loop anchors. Although DNA looping has most commonly been associated with enhancer-promoter communication, our results indicate that loops are also associated with gene repression.",

Within TADs, chromatin looping interactions are formed between DNA regulatory elements, but their functional importance for the establishment of the 3D genome organization and gene regulation during development is unclear. Using high-resolution Hi-C experiments, we analyze higher order 3D chromatin organization during Drosophila embryogenesis and identify active and repressive chromatin loops that are established with different kinetics and depend on distinct factors: Zelda-dependent active loops are formed before the midblastula transition between transcribed genes over long distances. Repressive loops within polycomb domains are formed after the midblastula transition between polycomb response elements by the action of GAGA factor and polycomb proteins. Perturbation of PRE function by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering affects polycomb domain formation and destabilizes polycomb-mediated silencing. Preventing loop formation without removal of polycomb components also decreases silencing efficiency, suggesting that chromatin architecture can play instructive roles in gene regulation during development.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19954516": " The INK4b-ARF-INK4a tumour suppressor locus controls the balance between progenitor cell renewal and cancer. In this study, we investigated how higher-order chromatin structure modulates differential expression of the human INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus during progenitor cell differentiation, cellular ageing and senescence of cancer cells. We found that INK4b and INK4a, but not ARF, are upregulated following the differentiation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, in ageing fibroblasts and in senescing malignant rhabdoid tumour cells. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism we analysed binding of polycomb group (PcG) repressive complexes (PRCs) and the spatial organization of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus. In agreement with differential derepression, PcG protein binding across the locus is discontinuous. As we described earlier, PcG repressors bind the INK4a promoter, but not ARF. Here, we identified a second peak of PcG binding that is located approximately 3 kb upstream of the INK4b promoter. During progenitor cell differentiation and ageing, PcG silencer EZH2 attenuates, causing loss of PRC binding and transcriptional activation of INK4b and INK4a. The expression pattern of the locus is reflected by its organization in space. In the repressed state, the PRC-binding regions are in close proximity, while the intervening chromatin harbouring ARF loops out. Down regulation of EZH2 causes release of the approximately 35 kb repressive chromatin loop and induction of both INK4a and INK4b, whereas ARF expression remains unaltered. PcG silencers bind and coordinately regulate INK4b and INK4a, but not ARF, during a variety of physiological processes. Developmentally regulated EZH2 levels are one of the factors that can determine the higher order chromatin structure and expression pattern of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus, coupling human progenitor cell differentiation to proliferation control. Our results revealed a chromatin looping mechanism of long-range control and argue against models involving homogeneous spreading of PcG silencers across the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus.",

The analysis process includes three main steps, namely normalization, dispersion estimation and test for differential expression. Quality control steps along this process are recommended but not mandatory, and failing to check the characteristics of the dataset may lead to spurious results. In addition, normalization methods and statistical models are not exchangeable across the packages without adequate transformations the users are often not aware of. Thus, dedicated analysis pipelines are needed to include systematic quality control steps and prevent errors from misusing the proposed methods. SARTools is an R pipeline for differential analysis of RNA-Seq count data. It can handle designs involving two or more conditions of a single biological factor with or without a blocking factor (such as a batch effect or a sample pairing). It is based on DESeq2 and edgeR and is composed of an R package and two R script templates (for DESeq2 and edgeR respectively). Tuning a small number of parameters and executing one of the R scripts, users have access to the full results of the analysis, including lists of differentially expressed genes and a HTML report that (i) displays diagnostic plots for quality control and model hypotheses checking and (ii) keeps track of the whole analysis process, parameter values and versions of the R packages used. SARTools provides systematic quality controls of the dataset as well as diagnostic plots that help to tune the model parameters. It gives access to the main parameters of DESeq2 and edgeR and prevents untrained users from misusing some functionalities of both packages.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26539333": "Background. A common research goal in transcriptome projects is to find genes that are differentially expressed in different phenotype classes. Biologists might wish to validate such gene candidates experimentally, or use them for downstream systems biology analysis. Producing a coherent differential gene expression analysis from RNA-seq count data requires an understanding of how numerous sources of variation such as the replicate size, the hypothesized biological effect size, and the specific method for making differential expression calls interact. We believe an explicit demonstration of such interactions in real RNA-seq data sets is of practical interest to biologists. Results. Using two large public RNA-seq data sets-one representing strong, and another mild, biological effect size-we simulated different replicate size scenarios, and tested the performance of several commonly-used methods for calling differentially expressed genes in each of them. We found that, when biological effect size was mild, RNA-seq experiments should focus on experimental validation of differentially expressed gene candidates. Importantly, at least triplicates must be used, and the differentially expressed genes should be called using methods with high positive predictive value (PPV), such as NOISeq or GFOLD. In contrast, when biological effect size was strong, differentially expressed genes mined from unreplicated experiments using NOISeq, ASC and GFOLD had between 30 to 50% mean PPV, an increase of more than 30-fold compared to the cases of mild biological effect size. Among methods with good PPV performance, having triplicates or more substantially improved mean PPV to over 90% for GFOLD, 60% for DESeq2, 50% for NOISeq, and 30% for edgeR. At a replicate size of six, we found DESeq2 and edgeR to be reasonable methods for calling differentially expressed genes at systems level analysis, as their PPV and sensitivity trade-off were superior to the other methods'. Conclusion. When biological effect size is weak, systems level investigation is not possible using RNAseq data, and no meaningful result can be obtained in unreplicated experiments. Nonetheless, NOISeq or GFOLD may yield limited numbers of gene candidates with good validation potential, when triplicates or more are available. When biological effect size is strong, NOISeq and GFOLD are effective tools for detecting differentially expressed genes in unreplicated RNA-seq experiments for qPCR validation. When triplicates or more are available, GFOLD is a sharp tool for identifying high confidence differentially expressed genes for targeted qPCR validation; for downstream systems level analysis, combined results from DESeq2 and edgeR are useful.",

The mutation data was sorted using \"maftools\" R package. TMB was estimated and then patients were divided into two groups based on TMB. The association of TMB with prognosis and clinical characteristics was explored. Differential analysis between two TMB groups was performed using \"DESeq2\" R package to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The function enrichment analyses of DEGs were conducted to screen critical pathways. Besides, DEGs were further filtered to identify two hub genes, based on which a risk score model and nomogram for predicting prognosis were conducted, and the validation was performed using three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Finally, CIBERSORT algorithm and TIMER database were used to assess the effect of TMB and hub genes on immune infiltration. <b>Results:</b> The most common mutation was C &gt; T, and the top three frequently mutated genes were <i>TTN, MUC16</i>, and <i>BRAF</i>. Higher TMB indicated better survival outcomes and lower pathological stages. 735 DEGs were identified and mainly involved in immune-related and adhesion-related pathways. The risk score model and nomogram were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves, and exhibited relatively high predictive capability. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical benefit. As for immune infiltration, the proportion was higher for macrophages M1 and M2 in the high-TMB group, while lower for memory B cells and regulatory T cells. <b>Conclusions:</b> In cutaneous melanoma, TMB was positively correlated with prognosis.

Here, we re-purpose RNA-sequencing data previously-collected by our group, investigating gene expression differences between wild-type mice of different age groups that represent key developmental milestones in the murine lifespan. DESeq2's generalized linear model was applied with two hypothesis testing approaches to identify differentially-expressed (DE) genes, both between pairs of age groups and across mice of all ages. Pairwise comparisons identified genes associated with specific age transitions, while comparisons across all age groups identified a large set of genes associated with the aging process more broadly. An unsupervised machine learning approach was then applied to extract common expression patterns from this set of age-associated genes. Sets of genes with both linear and non-linear expression trajectories were identified, suggesting that aging not only involves the activation of gene expression programs unique to different age groups, but also the re-activation of gene expression programs from earlier ages.

In this study, we use a plasmode-based approach to assess the relative performance of alternative inferential strategies on RNA-seq transcripts, with special emphasis on transcripts characterized by a small number of read counts, so-called low-count transcripts, as motivated by an ecological application in prairie grasses. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) is a wide-ranging dominant prairie grass of ecological and agricultural importance to the US Midwest while edaphic subspecies sand bluestem (A. gerardii ssp. Hallii) grows exclusively on sand dunes. Relative to big bluestem, sand bluestem exhibits qualitative phenotypic divergence consistent with enhanced drought tolerance, plausibly associated with transcripts of low expression levels. Our dataset consists of RNA-seq read counts for 25,582 transcripts (60% of which are classified as low-count) collected from leaf tissue of individual plants of big bluestem (n = 4) and sand bluestem (n = 4). Focused on low-count transcripts, we compare alternative ad-hoc data filtering techniques commonly used in RNA-seq pipelines and assess the inferential performance of recently developed statistical methods for DE analysis, namely DESeq2 and edgeR robust. These methods attempt to overcome the inherently noisy behavior of low-count transcripts by either shrinkage or differential weighting of observations, respectively. Both DE methods seemed to properly control family-wise type 1 error on low-count transcripts, whereas edgeR robust showed greater power and DESeq2 showed greater precision and accuracy. However, specification of the degree of freedom parameter under edgeR robust had a non-trivial impact on inference and should be handled carefully. When properly specified, both DE methods showed overall promising inferential performance on low-count transcripts, suggesting that ad-hoc data filtering steps at arbitrary expression thresholds may be unnecessary. A note of caution is in order regarding the approximate nature of DE tests under both methods. Practical recommendations for DE inference are provided when low-count RNA-seq transcripts are of interest, as is the case in the comparison of subspecies of bluestem grasses. Insights from this study may also be relevant to other applications focused on transcripts of low expression levels.",

Here, we describe a method that allows the control of protein abundance by a genetically encoded regulatory system. We developed a dormant N-degron that can be attached to the N-terminus of a protein of interest. Upon expression of a site-specific protease, the dormant N-degron becomes deprotected. The N-degron then targets itself and the attached protein for rapid proteasomal degradation through the N-end rule pathway. We use an optimized tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease variant combined with selective target binding to achieve complete and rapid deprotection of the N-degron-tagged proteins. This method, termed TEV protease induced protein inactivation (TIPI) of TIPI-degron (TDeg) modified target proteins is fast, reversible, and applicable to a broad range of proteins. TIPI of yeast proteins essential for vegetative growth causes phenotypes that are close to deletion mutants. The features of the TIPI system make it a versatile tool to study protein function in eukaryotes and to create new modules for synthetic or systems biology.",

We describe small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh), a technique in which proteins are fused to a degron that removes itself in the absence of drug, resulting in the production of an untagged protein. Clinically tested HCV protease inhibitors can then block degron removal, inducing rapid degradation of subsequently synthesized copies of the protein. SMASh allows reversible and dose-dependent shutoff of various proteins in multiple mammalian cell types and in yeast. We also used SMASh to confer drug responsiveness onto an RNA virus for which no licensed inhibitors exist. As SMASh does not require the permanent fusion of a large domain, it should be useful when control over protein production with minimal structural modification is desired. Furthermore, as SMASh involves only a single genetic modification and does not rely on modulating protein-protein interactions, it should be easy to generalize to multiple biological contexts.",

The auxin-inducible degron harbors great potential for dynamic protein depletion in yeast. Here, we thoroughly and quantitatively characterize the auxin-inducible degron in single yeast cells. We show that an auxin concentration of 0.25 mM is necessary for fast and uniform protein depletion between single cells, and that in mother cells proteins are depleted faster than their daughters. Although, protein recovery starts immediately after removal of auxin, it takes multiple generations before equilibrium is reached between protein synthesis and dilution, which is when the original protein levels are restored. Further, we found that blue light, used for GFP excitation, together with auxin results in growth defects, caused by the photo-destruction of auxin to its toxic derivatives, which can be avoided if indole-free auxin substitutes are used.

For efficient degradation, the proteasome requires both a ubiquitin tag, which delivers substrates to the proteasome, and an unstructured region, where the proteasome engages the substrate for unfolding and degradation. We fused two degron components into a single molecule to create a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin and Rpn4-derived unstructured region. We demonstrated that the fusion protein retained its function to polyubiquitinate target proteins, thereby inducing more efficient proteasomal target degradation than wild-type ubiquitin in vitro and in cells.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25653450": "Inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins are key regulators of the innate antiviral response by virtue of their capacity to respond to signals affecting cell survival. In insects, wherein the host IAP provides a primary restriction to apoptosis, diverse viruses trigger rapid IAP depletion that initiates caspase-mediated apoptosis, thereby limiting virus multiplication. We report here that the N-terminal leader of two insect IAPs, Spodoptera frugiperda SfIAP and Drosophila melanogaster DIAP1, contain distinct instability motifs that regulate IAP turnover and apoptotic consequences. Functioning as a protein degron, the cellular IAP leader dramatically shortened the life span of a long-lived viral IAP (Op-IAP3) when fused to its N terminus. The SfIAP degron contains mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK)-like regulatory sites, responsible for MAPK inhibitor-sensitive phosphorylation of SfIAP. Hyperphosphorylation correlated with increased SfIAP turnover independent of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of the SfIAP RING, which also regulated IAP stability. Together, our findings suggest that the SfIAP phospho-degron responds rapidly to a signal-activated kinase cascade, which regulates SfIAP levels and thus apoptosis. The N-terminal leader of dipteran DIAP1 also conferred virus-induced IAP depletion by a caspase-independent mechanism. DIAP1 instability mapped to previously unrecognized motifs that are not found in lepidopteran IAPs. Thus, the leaders of cellular IAPs from diverse insects carry unique signal-responsive degrons that control IAP turnover. Rapid response pathways that trigger IAP degradation and initiate apoptosis independent of canonical prodeath gene (Reaper-Grim-Hid) expression may provide important innate immune advantages. Furthermore, the elimination of these response motifs within viral IAPs, including those of baculoviruses, explains their unusual stability and their potent antiapoptotic activity. Apoptosis is an effective means by which a host controls virus infection. In insects, inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins act as regulatory sentinels by responding to cellular signals that determine the fate of infected cells. We discovered that lepidopteran (moth and butterfly) IAPs, which are degraded upon baculovirus infection, are controlled by a conserved phosphorylation-sensitive degron within the IAP N-terminal leader. The degron likely responds to virus-induced kinase-specific signals for degradation through SKP1/Cullin/F-box complex-mediated ubiquitination. Such signal-induced destruction of cellular IAPs is distinct from degradation caused by well-known IAP antagonists, which act to expel IAP-bound caspases. The major implication of this study is that insects have multiple signal-responsive mechanisms by which the sentinel IAPs are actively degraded to initiate host apoptosis. Such diversity of pathways likely provides insects with rapid and efficient strategies for pathogen control. Furthermore, the absence of analogous degrons in virus-encoded IAPs explains their relative stability and antiapoptotic potency.",

Current understanding of ubiquitination dependent and independent protein degradation processes has expanded the application of degrons for targeted protein degradation and novel cell engineering strategies. Recent findings suggest that small molecules inducing protein association can be exploited to create degrons that target proteins for degradation.

Most degrons are short linear motifs embedded within the sequences of modular proteins. As regulatory sites for protein abundance, they are important for many different cellular processes, such as progression through the cell cycle and monitoring cellular hypoxia. Degrons enable the elimination of proteins that are no longer required, preventing their possible dysfunction. Although the human genome encodes ~600 E3 ubiquitin ligases, only a fraction of these enzymes have well-defined target degrons. Thus, for most cellular proteins, the destruction mechanisms are poorly understood. This is important for many diseases, especially for cancer, a disease that involves the enhanced expression of oncogenes and the persistence of encoded oncoproteins coupled with reduced abundance of tumor suppressors. Loss-of-function mutations occur in the degrons of several oncoproteins, such as the transcription factors MYC and NRF2, and in various mitogenic receptors, such as NOTCH1 and several receptor tyrosine kinases. Mutations eliminating the function of the \u03b2-catenin degron are found in many cancers and are considered one of the most abundant mutations driving carcinogenesis.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545111": "Protein degradation is employed in both regulation and quality control. Regulated degradation of specific proteins is often mediated by discrete regions of primary sequence known as degrons, whereas protein quality control involves recognition of structural features common to damaged or misfolded proteins, rather than specific features of an individual protein. The yeast HMG-CoA reductase isozyme Hmg2p undergoes stringently regulated degradation by machinery that is also required for ER quality control. The 523 residue N-terminal transmembrane domain of Hmg2p is necessary and sufficient for regulated degradation. To understand how Hmg2p undergoes regulated degradation by the ER quality control pathway, we analyzed over 300 mutants of Hmg2p. Regulated degradation of Hmg2p requires information distributed over the entire transmembrane domain. Accordingly, we refer to this determinant as a 'distributed' degron, which has functional aspects consistent with both regulation and quality control. The Hmg2p degron functions in the specific, regulated degradation of Hmg2p and can impart regulated degradation to fusion proteins. However, its recognition is based on dispersed structural features rather than primary sequence motifs. This mode of targeting has important consequences both for the prediction of degradation substrates and as a potential therapeutic strategy for targeted protein degradation using endogenous degradation pathways.",

The prominent feature of the method is that it relaxes the rigidity of the orthology criterion and avoids many of the pitfalls of gene families identification methods, often hampered by multidomain proteins or low levels of sequence similarity. This approach, that allows both inter- and intrachromosomal comparisons, proves to be more sensitive than the classical methods based on pairwise sequence comparisons, particularly in the simultaneous treatment of many species. The automated and fast detection of domain teams is implemented in the DomainTeam software. In this chapter, we describe the procedure to run DomainTeam.

In particular, the choice of a set of markers and the effect of different aggregation strategies, which enable coarse graining of synteny blocks and exclusion of micro-rearrangements, need to be assessed. Therefore, existing tools and resources that facilitate identification, visualization and analysis of synteny need to be further improved to provide a flexible platform for such analysis, especially in the context of multiple genomes. We present a new tool, Cinteny, for fast identification and analysis of synteny with different sets of markers and various levels of coarse graining of syntenic blocks. Using Hannenhalli-Pevzner approach and its extensions, Cinteny also enables interactive determination of evolutionary relationships between genomes in terms of the number of rearrangements (the reversal distance).

In addition, Cinteny provides many annotated mammalian, invertebrate and fungal genomes that are pre-loaded and available for analysis at http://cinteny.cchmc.org. Cinteny allows one to automatically compare multiple genomes and perform sensitivity analysis for synteny block detection and for the subsequent computation of reversal distances.

SynBlast uses the genomic region around a focal reference gene to retrieve candidates for homologous regions from a collection of target genomes and ranks them in accord with the available evidence for homology. The pipeline is intended as a tool to aid high quality manual annotation in particular in those cases where automatic procedures fail.

We used sci-ATAC-seq to produce 2346 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility maps with a mean unique read count per cell of 29,201 from both fresh and frozen hippocampi, observing little difference in accessibility patterns between the preparations. By using this data set, we identified eight distinct major clusters of cells representing both neuronal and nonneuronal cell types and characterized the driving regulatory factors and differentially accessible loci that define each cluster. Within pyramidal neurons, we identified four major clusters, including CA1 and CA3 neurons, and three additional subclusters. We then applied a recently described coaccessibility framework, Cicero, which identified 146,818 links between promoters and putative distal regulatory DNA. Identified coaccessibility networks showed cell-type specificity, shedding light on key dynamic loci that reconfigure to specify hippocampal cell lineages. Lastly, we performed an additional sci-ATAC-seq preparation from cultured hippocampal neurons (899 high-quality cells, 43,532 mean unique reads) that revealed substantial alterations in their epigenetic landscape compared with nuclei from hippocampal tissue. This data set and accompanying analysis tools provide a new resource that can guide subsequent studies of the hippocampus.",

Single-cell ATAC-seq data are sparse and noisy, and analyzing such data is challenging. Existing computational methods cannot accurately reconstruct activities of individual cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in individual cells or rare cell subpopulations. We present a new statistical framework, SCATE, that adaptively integrates information from co-activated CREs, similar cells, and publicly available regulome data to substantially increase the accuracy for estimating activities of individual CREs.

Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.",

Perturb-ATAC in human B lymphocytes uncovered regulators of chromatin accessibility, TF occupancy, and nucleosome positioning and identified a hierarchy of TFs that govern B cell state, variation, and disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. Perturb-ATAC in primary human epidermal cells revealed three sequential modules of cis-elements that specify keratinocyte fate. Combinatorial deletion of all pairs of these TFs uncovered their epistatic relationships and highlighted genomic co-localization as a basis for synergistic interactions.

The conversion of mature B cell lymphomas to Langerhans cell neoplasms is not well documented. Three previous reports have described clonally related follicular lymphoma and Langerhans cell tumours, whereas no case has been published of clonally related marginal zone lymphoma and Langerhans cell sarcoma. We describe the case of a 77-year-old patient who developed a Langerhans cell sarcoma and 6 years later a nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Mutation status examination showed 100 % gene identity to the germline sequence, suggesting direct trans-differentiation or dedifferentiation of the nodal marginal zone lymphoma to the Langerhans cell sarcoma rather than a common progenitor. We found inactivation of paired box 5 (PAX-5) in the lymphoma cells by methylation, along with duplication of part of the long arm of chromosomes 16 and 17 in the sarcoma cells. The absence of PAX-5 could have triggered B cells to differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. On the other hand, chromosomal imbalances might have activated genes involved in myeloid lineage maturation, transcription activation and oncogenesis. We hypothesize that this occurred because of previous therapies for nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Better understanding of this phenomenon may help in unravelling the molecular interplay between transcription factors during haematopoietic lineage commitment and may expand the spectrum of clonally related mature B cell neoplasms and Langerhans cell tumours.",

Here, we applied insertional chromatin immunoprecipitation (iChIP) combined with stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (iChIP-SILAC) to direct identification of proteins interacting with the promoter region of the endogenous single-copy chicken Pax5 gene. By comparing B cells with macrophage-like cells trans-differentiated by ectopic expression of C/EBP\u03b2, iChIP-SILAC detected B cell-specific interaction of a nuclear protein, Thy28/Thyn1, with the Pax5 1A promoter. Trans-differentiation of B cells into macrophage-like cells caused down-regulation of Thy28 expression. Loss-of-function of Thy28 induced decrease in Pax5 expression and recruitment of myosin-9 (MYH9), one of Thy28-interacting proteins, to the Pax5 1A promoter. Loss-of-function of MYH9 also induced decrease in Pax5 expression. Thus, our analysis revealed that Thy28 is functionally required for B cell-specific expression of Pax5 via recruitment of MYH9 to the Pax5 locus in chicken B cells.",

Conversion of B cells to macrophages was readily induced by the ectopic expression of any C/EBP, and enhanced by endogenous C/EBP\u03b1 and \u03b2 activation. High transgene expression of C/EBP\u03b2 or C/EBP\u03b5, but not of C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b4, also induced the formation of granulocytes. Granulocytes and macrophages emerged in a mutually exclusive manner. C/EBP\u03b2-expressing B cells produced granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP)-like progenitors when subjected to selective pressure to eliminate lymphoid cells. The GMP-like progenitors remained self-renewing and cytokine-independent, and continuously produced macrophages and granulocytes. In addition to their suitability to study myelomonocytic lineage bifurcation, lineage-switched GMP-like progenitors could reflect the features of the lympho-myeloid lineage switch observed in leukemic progression.",

In addition to iPSCs, several other cell types have also been generated by master transcription factor (TF)-mediated transdifferentiation. However, the critical molecular mechanisms amongst diverse cellular identity changes are not well understood. Through the investigation of reprogramming mechanisms, we recently revealed that over-expression of constitutive active Smad3 boosted not only iPSC generation, but also 3 other master TF-mediated conversions, from B cells to macrophages, myoblasts to adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons. This demonstrated that there were common mechanisms underlying different master TF-mediated cell conversions. To illuminate such mechanisms further, we have recently performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide knockout screening during reprogramming with a lentiviral gRNA library containing 90,000 gRNAs. This screening provided us with ~15 novel reprogramming roadblock genes as well as ~20 candidate genes essential for the reprogramming process but not for ES cell self-renewal.

This developmental process is controlled by a complex regulatory network involving cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors, and chromatin remodelers. Using public data and data from our own molecular genetic experiments (quantitative PCR, Western blot, EMSA) or genome-wide assays (RNA-sequencing, ChIP-sequencing), we have assembled a comprehensive regulatory network encompassing the main transcription factors and signaling components involved in myeloid and lymphoid development. Focusing on B-cell and macrophage development, we defined a qualitative dynamical model recapitulating cytokine-induced differentiation of common progenitors, the effect of various reported gene knockdowns, and the reprogramming of pre-B cells into macrophages induced by the ectopic expression of specific transcription factors. The resulting network model can be used as a template for the integration of new hematopoietic differentiation and transdifferentiation data to foster our understanding of lymphoid/myeloid cell-fate decisions.",

However, how C/EBP\u03b1 accomplishes these effects is unclear. Here we find that in mouse primary B cells transient C/EBP\u03b1 expression followed by OSKM activation induces a 100-fold increase in iPS cell reprogramming efficiency, involving 95% of the population. During this conversion, pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes become markedly upregulated, and 60% of the cells express Oct4 within 2 days. C/EBP\u03b1 acts as a 'path-breaker' as it transiently makes the chromatin of pluripotency genes more accessible to DNase I. C/EBP\u03b1 also induces the expression of the dioxygenase Tet2 and promotes its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to regulatory regions of pluripotency genes that become demethylated after OSKM induction. In line with these findings, overexpression of Tet2 enhances OSKM-induced B-cell reprogramming. Because the enzyme is also required for efficient C/EBP\u03b1-induced immune cell conversion, our data indicate that Tet2 provides a mechanistic link between iPS cell reprogramming and B-cell transdifferentiation. The rapid iPS reprogramming approach described here should help to fully elucidate the process and has potential clinical applications.",

An ideal system to study the role of Tet2 in myelopoeisis is CEBP\u03b1-induced transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages. Here we found that CEBP\u03b1 binds to upstream regions of Tet2 and that the gene becomes activated. Tet2 knockdowns impaired the upregulation of macrophage markers as well as phagocytic capacity, suggesting that the enzyme is required for both early and late stage myeloid differentiation. A slightly weaker effect was seen in primary cells with a Tet2 ablation. Expression arrays of transdifferentiating cells with Tet2 knockdowns permitted the identification of a small subset of myeloid genes whose upregulation was blunted. Activation of these target genes was accompanied by rapid increases of promoter hydroxy-methylation. Our observations indicate that Tet2 helps CEBP\u03b1 rapidly derepress myeloid genes during the conversion of pre-B cells into macrophages.",

A transcriptome analysis of transdifferentiating cells showed that most genes are up- or down-regulated continuously, acquiring a macrophage phenotype within 5 d. In addition, we observed the transient reactivation of a subset of immature myeloid markers, as well as low levels of the progenitor markers Kit and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 and a few lineage-inappropriate genes. Importantly, however, we were unable to observe the reexpression of cell-surface marker combinations that characterize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, including c-Kit and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3, even when CAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b1 was activated in pre-B cells under culture conditions that favor growth of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells or when the transcription factor was activated in a time-limited fashion. Together, our findings are consistent with the notion that the conversion from pre-B cells to macrophages is mostly direct and does not involve overt retrodifferentiation.",

Forced C/EBPalpha expression furthermore induces direct transdifferentiation of immature thymocytes or B cells into macrophages. Notably, conditional inactivation of the B cell commitment factor Pax5 is sufficient to convert mature B cells into functional T cells via dedifferentiation to uncommitted progenitors.

Testing &gt;20 human lymphoma and leukemia B cell lines, we found that most can be transdifferentiated at least partially into macrophage-like cells, provided that C/EBP\u03b1 is expressed at sufficiently high levels. A tamoxifen-inducible subclone of the Seraphina Burkitt lymphoma line, expressing C/EBP\u03b1ER, could be efficiently converted into phagocytic and quiescent cells with a transcriptome resembling normal macrophages. The converted cells retained their phenotype even when C/EBP\u03b1 was inactivated, a hallmark of cell reprogramming. Interestingly, C/EBP\u03b1 induction also impaired the cells' tumorigenicity. Likewise, C/EBP\u03b1 efficiently converted a lymphoblastic leukemia B cell line into macrophage-like cells, again dramatically impairing their tumorigenicity.

The transcription factors that determine the decision between lymphoid and myeloid cell fates, and the underlying mechanisms, remain largely unknown. Here, we report that enforced expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta in differentiated B cells leads to their rapid and efficient reprogramming into macrophages. C/EBPs induce these changes by inhibiting the B cell commitment transcription factor Pax5, leading to the downregulation of its target CD19, and synergizing with endogenous PU.1, an ETS family factor, leading to the upregulation of its target Mac-1 and other myeloid markers. The two processes can be uncoupled, since, in PU.1-deficient pre-B cells, C/EBPs induce CD19 downregulation but not Mac-1 activation. Our observations indicate that C/EBPalpha and beta remodel the transcription network of B cells into that of macrophages through a series of parallel and sequential changes that require endogenous PU.1.",

We here investigated the acquisition of DNA methylation changes during C/EBP\u03b1-induced pre-B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation. Unexpectedly, cell lineage conversion occurred without significant changes in DNA methylation not only in key B cell- and macrophage-specific genes but also throughout the entire set of genes differentially methylated between the two parental cell types. In contrast, active and repressive histone modification marks changed according to the expression levels of these genes. We also demonstrated that C/EBP\u03b1 and RNA Pol II are associated with the methylated promoters of macrophage-specific genes in reprogrammed macrophages without inducing methylation changes. Our findings not only provide insights about the extent and hierarchy of epigenetic events in pre-B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation but also show an important difference to reprogramming towards pluripotency where promoter DNA demethylation plays a pivotal role.",

Using inducible pre-B cell lines, we have now investigated the role of cell division during C/EBP-induced reprogramming. The majority of cells reprogrammed by C/EBP\u03b1 incorporated BrdU before arresting at G(0), and all C/EBP\u03b2-induced cells incorporated the compound. This contrasts with reports from other systems where transdifferentiating cells essentially do not divide. Although inhibition of DNA synthesis led to an impairment of C/EBP\u03b1-induced transdifferentiation, sorted G(0)/G(1) and G(2)/M fractions showed no significant differences in their reprogramming kinetics. In addition, knocking-down p53 did not accelerate the transdifferentiation frequency, as it has been described for reprogramming of induced pluripotent (iPS) cells. Time-lapse experiments showed that, after C/EBP\u03b1 induction, approximately 90% of cells divide once or twice, while 8% do not divide at all before acquiring a macrophage phenotype, supporting our BrdU incorporation results. Importantly, the non-dividing cell subset expressed the highest levels of C/EBP\u03b1 and was the fastest in differentiating, suggesting that high levels of C/EBP\u03b1 accelerate both the switching process and the cells' growth arrest.

C/EBPa-induced pre-B cell-to-macrophage transdifferentiation provides an excellent model to investigate the contribution of miRNAs to hematopoietic cell identity, especially because the two cell types involved fall into separate lymphoid and myeloid branches. In this process, efficient repression of the B cell-specific program is essential to ensure transdifferentation and macrophage function. miRNA profiling revealed that upregulation of miRNAs is highly predominant compared with downregulation and that C/EBPa directly regulates several upregulated miRNAs. We also determined that miRNA 34a (miR-34a) and miR-223 sharply accelerate C/EBPa-mediated transdifferentiation, whereas their depletion delays this process. These two miRNAs affect the transdifferentiation efficiency and activity of macrophages, including their lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent inflammatory response. miR-34a and miR-223 directly target and downregulate the lymphoid transcription factor Lef1, whose ectopic expression delays transdifferentiation to an extent similar to that seen with miR-34a and miR-223 depletion. In addition, ectopic introduction of Lef1 in macrophages causes upregulation of B cell markers, including CD19, Pax5, and Ikzf3. Our report demonstrates the importance of these miRNAs in ensuring the erasure of key B cell transcription factors, such as Lef1, and reinforces the notion of their essential role in fine-tuning the control required for establishing cell identity.",

Through integration of the available apple genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets, we constructed co-expression networks, identified functional modules, and predicted chromatin states. A total of 112 RNA-seq datasets were integrated to construct a global network and a conditional network (tissue-preferential network). Furthermore, a total of 1,076 functional modules with closely related gene sets were identified to assess the modularity of biological networks and further subjected to functional enrichment analysis. The results showed that the function of many modules was related to development, secondary metabolism, hormone response, and transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulation is closely related to epigenetic marks on chromatin. A total of 20 epigenomic datasets, which included ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and DNA methylation analysis datasets, were integrated and used to classify chromatin states.

Although the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enables measurement of epigenetic information for entire genomes at high-resolution, the variety of chromatin states has not been completely characterized. In this study, we propose a method to estimate the chromatin states indicated by genome-wide chromatin marks identified by NGS technologies. The proposed method automatically estimates the number of chromatin states and characterize each state on the basis of a hidden Markov model (HMM) in combination with a recently proposed model selection technique, factorized information criteria. The method is expected to provide an unbiased model because it relies on only two adjustable parameters and avoids heuristic procedures as much as possible. Computational experiments with simulated datasets show that our method automatically learns an appropriate model, even in cases where methods that rely on Bayesian information criteria fail to learn the model structures.

Recent studies have shown that not only single epigenetic modifications but also combinations of multiple epigenetic modifications play vital roles in gene regulation. A striking example is the long hypomethylated regions enriched with modified H3K27me3 (called, \"K27HMD\" regions), which are exposed to suppress the expression of key developmental genes relevant to cellular development and differentiation during embryonic stages in vertebrates. It is thus a biologically important issue to develop an effective optimization algorithm for detecting long DNA regions (e.g., &gt;4 kbp in size) that harbor a specific combination of epigenetic modifications (e.g., K27HMD regions). However, to date, optimization algorithms for these purposes have received little attention, and available methods are still heuristic and ad hoc. In this paper, we propose a linear time algorithm for calculating a set of non-overlapping regions that maximizes the sum of similarities between the vector of focal epigenetic states and the vectors of raw epigenetic states at DNA positions in the set of regions. The average elapsed time to process the epigenetic data of any of human chromosomes was less than 2 seconds on an Intel Xeon CPU.

Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results. We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes. mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.",

We report a one-in-all solution called hppRNA, composed of four scenarios such as pre-mapping, core-workflow, post-mapping and sequence variation detection, written by a series of individual Perl and R scripts, counting on well-established and preinstalled software, irrespective of single-end or paired-end, unstranded or stranded sequencing method. It features six independent core-workflows comprising the state-of-the-art technology with dozens of popular cutting-edge tools such as Tophat-Cufflink-Cuffdiff, Subread-featureCounts-DESeq2, STAR-RSEM-EBSeq, Bowtie-eXpress-edgeR, kallisto-sleuth, HISAT-StringTie-Ballgown, and embeds itself in Snakemake, which is a modern pipeline management system. The core function of this pipeline is turning the raw fastq files into gene/isoform expression matrix and differentially expressed genes or isoforms as well as the identification of fusion genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms, long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs.

Individually, all three motifs stimulated transcription of the TKCAT promoter, and bound distinctly different proteins from the liver and differentiated C2C12 nuclear extracts. Collectively, these motifs, together with the downstream flanking sequence, -378 to -320, suppressed the transcription activity of heterologous promoters, thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (TKCAT) and COXIV/CAT. The transcription activities of both TKCAT and COXIV/CAT constructs were induced 3-4-fold during induced myogenesis of C2C12 cells. The downstream CArG-like motif binds transcription factor YY-1, while the upstream YY-1-like motif binds to a yet unidentified factor. Co-expression with intact YY-1, but not that lacking the DNA binding domain suppressed the transcriptional activity. Mutations targeted to the CArG-like motif abolished the suppressive effect of the negative enhancer and the inducibility of the promoter during myogenic differentiation. Our results suggest that the activity of the negative enhancer may determine the level of expression of the COX Vb gene in different tissues.",

We show here that transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila tropomyosin I (TmI) gene during myogenesis is under the control of at least two muscle enhancer regions located within the first intron of the gene. Together these enhancer regions contain multiple muscle-type-specific positive and negative cis-acting elements which together contribute toward full expression of the gene. One of these enhancers is contained within a 355-bp fragment that is sufficient to direct high levels of temporally regulated expression from a heterologous promoter in all muscles of transgenic flies. Dissection of this enhancer region into smaller fragments has allowed us to identify a 91-bp enhancer fragment sufficient for directing expression in all somatic and visceral muscles of the larva and adult but not in the indirect flight muscles and tergal depressor of the trochanter or jump muscles of the adult. We also show that this somatic/visceral muscle element(s) can be repressed through an adjacent negative control region, suggesting that the regulation of expression in these muscles is under dual control during both phases of myogenesis. We propose a model in which transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila TmI gene is controlled by the cooperative interaction of multiple positive and negative cis-acting regulatory elements that control the temporal and muscle-type pattern of expression. The distribution of enhancer elements and their control of TmI gene expression are similar to those regulating transcription of the muscle promoter of the TmII gene and provide a framework for the coordinate expression of the two genes.",

To understand the mechanism regulating the expression of CANP at the transcriptional level, we isolated a human gene for the large subunit of mCANP (CANP mL) and analyzed its 5'-region. The transcription initiation sites were mapped to multiple positions (-142 to -103, A of initiation ATG as +1). The upstream region lacks typical promoter elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes and is characterized by its high GC content (-300 to -20, 70% GC content). Functional analyses of the 5'-region by a transient expression assay on HeLa cells revealed that the region (-202 to -80) has a promoter activity. The upstream half of the promoter region (-202 to -130) acts as an upstream promoter element in an orientation-independent manner. Upstream of the promoter region are tandemly reiterated multiple regulatory regions (-2.5k to -690, -690 to -460, -460 to -260, and -260 to -202), each of which negatively regulates the CANP mL gene promoter as well as heterologous promoters in an orientation-independent manner. The presence of a cellular factor(s) mediating the action of these positive (promoter) and negative regulatory elements was suggested by an in vivo competition assay. The negative regulation of transcription mediated by these reiterated cis-acting elements and trans-acting factor(s) may play an essential role in the expression of the CANP mL gene.",

Here we report the required actions of LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1)/cofactor of LIM homeodomain protein 2/nuclear LIM interactor, interacting with the enhancer-binding protein achaete-scute complex homolog 1, to mediate looping to target gene promoters and target gene regulation in corticotrope cells. LDB1-mediated enhancer:promoter looping appears to be required for both activation and repression of these target genes. Although LDB1-dependent activated genes are regulated at the level of transcriptional initiation, the LDB1-dependent repressed transcription units appear to be regulated primarily at the level of promoter pausing, with LDB1 regulating recruitment of metastasis-associated 1 family, member 2, a component of the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex, on these negative enhancers, required for the repressive enhancer function. These results indicate that LDB1-dependent looping events can deliver repressive cargo to cognate promoters to mediate promoter pausing events in a pituitary cell type.",

We showed that regions downstream of the Ty2-917 transcription start site modulate its transcription. One region was located downstream of the transcription initiation site (position 240) and within the first 559 base pairs of the element. This region had a dramatic effect, causing an approximately 1,000-fold increase in steady-state levels of RNA. The region stimulated transcription when placed in either orientation upstream of a heterologous gene, HIS4, lacking its own upstream activation sequence (UAS). We termed this positively acting region an enhancer, by analogy to sites described in higher cells, to distinguish it from yeast UASs which do not function when placed within the transcribed portion of the gene. Though, like some higher eucaryotic enhancers, the Ty2-917 enhancer is located within the transcribed region, it is unlike them in that it occurs within a coding region rather than in an intron. The Ty2-917 enhancer and the Ty2-917 UAS had a synergistic effect on transcription, together stimulating transcription 15-fold over the predicted additive effect. We also identified a site which decreases RNA accumulation, located about 750 base pairs into the element. This site functioned in only one orientation when inserted upstream of the UAS-less heterologous gene. The site was similar to silencers, or negative enhancers, in that it acted to repress transcription from outside the transcribed region, but was distinct in that the function of a canonical silencer was independent of orientation.",

However, the molecular determinants that regulate neural patterning remain poorly understood. Here we optimized the \"dual SMAD inhibition\" method to specifically promote differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into forebrain and hindbrain neural progenitor cells along the rostral-caudal axis. We report that neural patterning determination occurs at the very early stage in this differentiation. Undifferentiated hPSCs expressed basal levels of the transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) that dominantly drove hPSCs into the \"default\" rostral fate at the beginning of differentiation. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) through CHIR99021 application sustained transient expression of the transcription factor NANOG at early differentiation stages through Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling and NANOG antagonized OTX2 and, in the later stages of differentiation, switched the default rostral cell fate to the caudal one. Our findings have uncovered a mutual antagonism between NANOG and OTX2 underlying cell fate decisions during neural patterning, critical for the regulation of early neural development in humans.",

This heterogeneity reflects the dynamic condition of ESCs and their versatility to promptly respond to signaling effectors promoting naive or primed pluripotency. Here, we report that ESCs lacking Nanog or overexpressing Otx2 exhibit an early primed identity in LIF + FBS and fail to convert into 2i-induced naive state. Conversely, Otx2-null ESCs possess naive identity features in LIF + FBS similar to Nanog-overexpressing ESCs and convert poorly into FGF-induced early primed state. When both Nanog and Otx2 are inactivated, ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS exhibit primed identity and weakened ability to convert into naive state. These data suggest that, through mutual antagonism, NANOG and OTX2 specify the heterogeneous identity of ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS and individually predispose them for optimal response to naive or primed inducing factors.",

Although core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Here we uncover a role for Otx2 in the control of the naive pluripotent state. We analyzed Otx2-binding activity in ESCs and EpiSCs and identified Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 as direct targets. To unravel the Otx2 transcriptional network, we targeted the strongest Otx2-binding site in the Nanog promoter, finding that this site modulates the size of specific ESC-subtype compartments in cultured cells and promotes Nanog expression in vivo, predisposing ICM differentiation to epiblast. Otx2-mediated Nanog regulation thus contributes to the integrity of the ESC state and cell lineage specification in preimplantation development.",

However, the molecular features and function of porcine OTX2 have not been well elucidated in porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs). By studying high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and interfering endogenous <i>OTX2</i> expression, we demonstrate that OTX2 is able to downgrade the self-renewal of piPSCs. <i>OTX2</i> is highly expressed in porcine brain, reproductive tissues, and preimplantation embryos, but is undetectable in fibroblasts and most somatic tissues. However, the known piPSC lines reported previously produced different levels of OTX2 depending on the induction procedures and culture conditions. Overexpression of porcine OTX2 can reduce the percentage of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies and downregulate <i>NANOG</i> and <i>OCT4</i> expression. In contrast, knockdown of <i>OTX2</i> can significantly increase endogenous expressions of <i>NANOG</i>, <i>OCT4</i>, and <i>ESRRB</i>, and stabilize the pluripotent state of piPSCs. On the other hand, NANOG can directly bind to the <i>OTX2</i> promoter as shown in ChIP-seq data and repress <i>OTX2</i> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner.

Hub enhancers share similar histone marks with non-hub enhancers, but are distinctly associated with cohesin and CTCF binding sites and disease-associated genetic variants. Genetic ablation of hub enhancers results in profound defects in gene activation and local chromatin landscape.

As pups grow, the greatly increasing demand for milk requires progressive differentiation of mammary cells with advancing lactation. Here we investigate how persistent hormonal exposure during lactation shapes an evolving enhancer landscape and impacts the biology of mammary cells. Employing ChIP-seq, we uncover a changing transcription factor occupancy at mammary enhancers, suggesting that their activities evolve with advancing differentiation. Using mouse genetics, we demonstrate that the functions of individual enhancers within the Wap super-enhancer evolve as lactation progresses. Most profoundly, a seed enhancer, which is mandatory for the activation of the Wap super-enhancer during pregnancy, is not required during lactation, suggesting compensatory flexibility. Combinatorial deletions of structurally equivalent constituent enhancers demonstrated differentiation-specific compensatory activities during lactation. We also demonstrate that the Wap super-enhancer, which is built on STAT5 and other common transcription factors, retains its exquisite mammary specificity when placed into globally permissive chromatin, suggesting a limited role of chromatin in controlling cell specificity. Our studies unveil a previously unrecognized progressive enhancer landscape where structurally equivalent components serve unique and differentiation-specific functions.",

Although there is evidence that chromatin neighbourhoods, formed by the zinc-finger protein CTCF, can sequester enhancers and their target genes, there is limited in vivo evidence for CTCF demarcating super-enhancers and preventing cross talk between distinct regulatory elements. Here, we address these questions in the Wap locus with its mammary-specific super-enhancer separated by CTCF sites from widely expressed genes. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the Wap super-enhancer controls Ramp3, despite three separating CTCF sites. Their deletion in mice results in elevated expression of Ramp3 in mammary tissue through augmented promoter-enhancer interactions. Deletion of the distal CTCF-binding site results in loss of Ramp3 expression in non-mammary tissues. This suggests that CTCF sites are porous borders, allowing a super-enhancer to activate a secondary target. Likewise, CTCF sites shield a widely expressed gene from suppressive influences of a silent locus.",

BRD4 inhibition resulted in induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and commitment to the neuroectodermal lineage while reducing the ESC multidifferentiation capacity in teratoma assays. BRD4 maintains transcription of core stem cell genes such as OCT4 and PRDM14 by occupying their super-enhancers (SEs), large clusters of regulatory elements, and recruiting to them Mediator and CDK9, the catalytic subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), to allow Pol-II-dependent productive elongation.

We examined the hypothesis that the antiphlogistic effects of methotrexate result from its capacity to promote intracellular accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) that, under conditions of cell injury, increases local adenosine release. We now present the first evidence to establish this mechanism of action in an in vivo model of inflammation, the murine air pouch model. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either methotrexate or saline for 3-4 wk during induction of air pouches. Pharmacologically relevant doses of methotrexate increased splenocyte AICAR content, raised adenosine concentrations in exudates from carrageenan-inflamed air pouches, and markedly inhibited leukocyte accumulation in inflamed air pouches. The methotrexate-mediated reduction in leukocyte accumulation was partially reversed by injection of adenosine deaminase (ADA) into the air pouch, completely reversed by a specific adenosine A2 receptor antagonist, 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX), but not affected by an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-dipropylxanthine. Neither ADA nor DMPX affected leukocyte accumulation in the inflamed pouches of animals treated with either saline or the potent antiinflammatory steroid dexamethasone.

To investigate the potential influence of the antiphlogistic ingredients panthenol and bisabolol in sunscreens on the determined SPF value in vivo. Formulations with different concentrations of the antiphlogistic ingredients bisabolol or panthenol were tested. As a reference, a base formulation (vehicle) without antiphlogistic ingredients was used. First, the SPF of the sunscreen formulas with and without antiphlogistic ingredients was analyzed in vitro. To investigate whether the antiphlogistic ingredient may suppress the inflammatory response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the SPF was determined in vivo. Finally, selected formulations were also analyzed in an erythema model for testing formulations on UV-induced inflammation. It could be confirmed that no differences between the formula with and that without the active antiphlogistic ingredients bisabolol or panthenol exist when measured in vitro. However, there was also no statistically significant difference in the erythemal response between the vehicle (without an antiphlogistic active ingredient) and the test formulations with different concentrations of the antiphlogistic active ingredients in the in vivo determination of the SPF. Evidence of anti-inflammatory activity of the sunscreen antiphlogistics bisabolol and panthenol was also not apparent in the UV model over a time course of 48 h.

Fibroblasts are powerful mediators of chronic inflammation. However, little is known about eicosanoid formation by human fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to analyze the formation of the most relevant inflammation mediators including proteins and lipids in human fibroblasts upon inflammatory stimulation and subsequent treatment with dexamethasone, a powerful antiphlogistic drug. Label-free quantification was applied for proteome profiling, while an in-house established data-dependent analysis method based on high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied for eicosadomics. Furthermore, a set of 188 metabolites was determined by targeted analysis. The secretion of 40 proteins including cytokines, proteases, and other inflammation agonists as well as 14 proinflammatory and nine anti-inflammatory eicosanoids was found significantly induced, while several acylcarnithins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated upon inflammatory stimulation. Treatment with dexamethasone downregulated most cytokines and proteases, abrogated the formation of pro- but also anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, and restored normal levels of acylcarnithins but not of sphingomyelins. In addition, the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, and complement C3, known to contribute to chronic inflammation, were not counter-regulated by dexamethasone. Similar findings were obtained with human mesenchymal stem cells, and results were confirmed by targeted analysis with multiple reaction monitoring. Comparative proteome profiling regarding other cells demonstrated cell-type-specific synthesis of, among others, eicosanoid-forming enzymes as well as relevant transcription factors, allowing us to better understand cell-type-specific regulation of inflammation mediators and shedding new light on the role of fibroblasts in chronic inflammation.",

IL-1\u03b2 is the most studied of the IL-1 family of cytokines, including 11 members, among which are IL-1\u03b1 and IL-18. Here, we summarize preclinical and clinical findings supporting the key pathogenetic role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1 cytokines in the formation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis, in ischemic (acute myocardial infarction), and nonischemic injury to the myocardium (myocarditis) and the progression to heart failure. We also review the clinically available IL-1 inhibitors, although not currently approved for cardiovascular indications, and discuss other IL-1 inhibitors, not currently approved, as well as oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1\u03b2 antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including 10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, has also shown promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features. Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1\u00df antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are unselective IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u00df blockers. To date, there is no evidence that specificity against IL-1\u00df affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing pericarditis, although it has been proposed that unspecific blockage might be useful in severe disease. Anakinra is the first anti-IL-1 agent with well-documented efficacy and safety in adult and pediatric patients with idiopathic relapsing pericarditis. Other anti-IL-1 agents are currently under study. Future research should clarify the optimal duration of therapy and tapering schedule of treatment with these agents. Moreover, biomarkers would be required to understand which patients will benefit from early administration of IL-1 blockers due to refractoriness to conventional therapy and which others will suffer from recurrences during the tapering of these agents. Lastly, future studies should focus on the subjects with the autoimmune or the pauci-inflammatory phenotype of idiopathic refractory pericarditis.",

These agents differ in terms of their effectiveness for controlling specific rheumatic diseases depending on the pivotal cytokine driving the inflammatory process. Cytokine blockers were the first to be developed and rapidly expanded. They include agents that act against tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1) (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and interleukin (IL) 6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL\u20111 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept), IL\u201117 (secukinumab and ixekizumab), and IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) receptors. Lymphocyte\u2011targeting agents include rituximab and belimumab, which act against B cells by different mechanisms, and abatacept, which is a T cell costimulation modulator. tsDMARDs, also known as small\u2011molecule inhibitors, are oral drugs based on a novel strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib) and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors (apremilast) form this group. The major concern with the use of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs is a higher risk of infections. Performance of blood tests as well as screening for tuberculosis and hepatitis viral infection are mandatory prior to biologic therapy initiation. Adherence to an immunization program is also recommended. Whenever possible, the choice of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs should be guided by the patient's comorbidities. There have been limited data on the use of these drugs during pregnancy, but anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy, rituximab, and anakinra seem to be safe. Biologic agents are expensive, but biosimilars have emerged as a cost\u2011effective option with a potential to treat a greater number of patients.",

The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven, randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were enrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and background medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response (i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive continued rilonacept monotherapy or placebo, administered subcutaneously once weekly. The primary efficacy end point, assessed with a Cox proportional-hazards model, was the time to the first pericarditis recurrence. Safety was also assessed. A total of 86 patients with pericarditis pain and an elevated CRP level were enrolled in the run-in period. During the run-in period, the median time to resolution or near-resolution of pain was 5 days, and the median time to normalization of the CRP level was 7 days. A total of 61 patients underwent randomization. During the randomized-withdrawal period, there were too few recurrence events in the rilonacept group to allow for the median time to the first adjudicated recurrence to be calculated; the median time to the first adjudicated recurrence in the placebo group was 8.6 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 11.7; hazard ratio in a Cox proportional-hazards model, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; P&lt;0.001 by the log-rank test). During this period, 2 of 30 patients (7%) in the rilonacept group had a pericarditis recurrence, as compared with 23 of 31 patients (74%) in the placebo group. In the run-in period, 4 patients had adverse events leading to the discontinuation of rilonacept therapy. The most common adverse events with rilonacept were injection-site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections. Among patients with recurrent pericarditis, rilonacept led to rapid resolution of recurrent pericarditis episodes and to a significantly lower risk of pericarditis recurrence than placebo.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549233": "There is an expanding role for interleukin (IL)-1 in diseases from gout to cancer. More than any other cytokine family, the IL-1 family is closely linked to innate inflammatory and immune responses. This linkage is because the cytoplasmic segment of all members of the IL-1 family of receptors contains a domain, which is highly homologous to the cytoplasmic domains of all toll-like receptors (TLRs). This domain, termed \"toll IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain,\" signals as does the IL-1 receptors; therefore, inflammation due to the TLR and the IL-1 families is nearly the same. Fundamental responses such as the induction of cyclo-oxygenase type 2, increased surface expression of cellular adhesion molecules and increased gene expression of a broad number of inflammatory molecules characterizes IL-1 signal transduction as it does for TLR agonists. IL-1\u03b2 is the most studied member of the IL-1 family because of its role in mediating autoinflammatory disease. However, a role for IL-1\u03b1 in disease is being validated because of the availability of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to human IL-1\u03b1. There are presently three approved therapies for blocking IL-1 activity. Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, which binds to the IL-1 receptor and prevents the binding of IL-1\u03b2 as well as IL-1\u03b1. Rilonacept is a soluble decoy receptor that neutralizes primarily IL-1\u03b2 but also IL-1\u03b1. Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes only IL-1\u03b2. Thus, a causal or significant contributing role can be established for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1 in human disease.",

Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (DeepCC), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, DeepCC provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.",

However, within the past decade, an increasing number of reports have questioned the actual validity of the FDA warning, especially considering a decline in the prescription of the antidepressant drugs associated with an increase in the rate of suicidal events among people with severe depression. The present report provides an overview of the FDA black box warning, also documenting two Major Depressive Disorder patients whose refusal to undergo a pharmacological antidepressant treatment possibly led to an increased risk for suicidal behaviors.

Until today, this issue remained controversial. The present review gives an overview on the relationship between antidepressant therapy and the risk of suicide and suicidality, respectively: there is no evidence of an increased risk of suicide, but of an increased rate of suicidality during the first period after starting an antidepressant treatment in young patients. Importantly, this risk was not higher than before treatment initiation. However, an intensified supervision is needed especially during the first weeks of treatment.

In 2007, the warning was expanded to include young adults aged under 25 years. In 2005, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration responded to the FDA warning by requiring Product and Consumer Information leaflets to be updated to reflect the risk. However, there was considerable debate, and at times emotive backlash, in academic journals and the international media. Prominent US and Australian mental health organisations and psychiatrists challenged the FDA warning. They argued that, on balance, antidepressant use was likely to reduce the risk of suicide. Several ecological studies were cited misleadingly as evidence that decreasing antidepressant use increases suicide risk. From 2008 to 2018, Australian per-capita child, adolescent and young adult antidepressant dispensing (0-27 years of age) and suicide (0-24 years) rates have increased approximately 66% and 49%, respectively. In addition, there was a 98% increase in intentional poisonings among 5 to 19 year-olds in New South Wales and Victoria between 2006 and 2016, with substantial overlap between the most commonly dispensed psychotropics and the drugs most commonly used in self-poisoning. These results do not support claims that increased antidepressant use reduces youth suicide risk. They are more consistent with the FDA warning and the hypothesis that antidepressant use increases the risk of suicide and self-harm by young people. Causal relationships cannot be established with certainty until there is a vast improvement in post-marketing surveillance. However, there is clear evidence that more young Australians are taking antidepressants, and more young Australians are killing themselves and self-harming, often by intentionally overdosing on the very substances that are supposed to help them.",

Subsequently, some researchers have concluded that the Black Box warning caused severe unintended consequences; specifically, they have argued that the warning led to reduced use of antidepressants among youth, which led to more suicides. In this paper, we critically examine research regarding the Black Box warning's alleged deleterious consequences. One study claimed that controlled trials did not actually find an increased risk of suicidality among youth taking fluoxetine relative to those taking placebo, but its measure of suicidality is likely invalid. We found that ecological time series studies claiming that decreasing antidepressant prescriptions are linked to higher rates of suicide attempts or actual suicides among youth were methodologically weak. These studies exhibited shortcomings including: selective use of time points, use of only a short-term time series, lack of performing statistical analysis, not examining level of severity/impairment among participants, inability to control confounding variables, and/or use of questionable measures of suicide attempts. Further, while some time-series studies claim that increased antidepressant prescriptions are related to fewer youth suicides, more recent data suggests that increasing antidepressant prescriptions are related to more youth suicide attempts and more completed suicides among American children and adolescents. We also note that case-control studies show increased risk of suicide attempts and suicide among youth taking antidepressants, even after controlling for some relevant confounds. As clinical trials have the greatest ability to control relevant confounds, it is important to remember such trials demonstrated increased risk of suicidality adverse events among youth taking antidepressants. The Black Box warning is firmly rooted in solid data whereas attempts to claim the warning has caused harm are based on quite weak evidence.",

Evidence examined includes (1) case reports; (2) temporal association between onset of depression and exposure to the drug; (3) challenge-rechallenge cases; (4) class effect (other compounds in the same class, like vitamin A, having similar neuropsychiatric effects); (5) dose response; and (6) biologically plausible mechanisms. All articles in the literature related to isotretinoin, depression, and suicide were reviewed, as well as articles related to class effect, dose response, and biologic plausibility. Information from individual articles in the literature was extracted, including number of episodes of depression, suicidality, suicide, psychosis, violence and aggression, past psychiatric history, time of onset in relation to isotretinoin usage, medication dosage, duration of treatment, and dechallenge and challenge history.

Of these suicides, 260 were in the 10-14 year age group, making suicide the third largest cause of death behind accidents and malignancy. Although 60% of suicides in the general population occur in the midst of a mood disorder, usually untreated, little is known about the relationship between treatment of mood disorders and youth suicide. The FDA recently linked adverse event reports of suicidal ideation among children and adolescents in randomized controlled trials to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and consequently required a change in labeling that included a black box warning regarding SSRI use for all age groups. Given that the age-adjusted suicide rate is about six times higher in 15-19 year olds compared with 10-14 year olds, the risk-benefit ratio may be different in younger children. Therefore, this study examined the association between antidepressant medication prescription rate and suicide rate in children ages 5-14 prior to the FDA findings by analyzing associations at the county level across the United States. National county-level suicide rate data among children ages 5-14 were broken down by sex, income, and race during the period 1996-1998. National county-level antidepressant prescription rate data were expressed as number of pills prescribed per person. The primary outcome measure was the suicide rate in each county expressed as number of suicides for a given population size. After adjustment for sex, race, income, access to mental health care, and county-to-county variability in suicide rates, higher SSRI prescription rates were associated with lower suicide rates in children and adolescents. The aggregate nature of these observational data precludes a direct causal interpretation of the results.

Globally, fewer than half of depression sufferers receive treatment for their illness, and in some countries this figure falls to fewer than 1 in 10. The high incidence rate, combined with limited market penetration, makes depression a high potential market for pharmaceuticals. However, companies developing drugs for depression also face a number of serious challenges. Psychosocial treatment options remain the preferred first-line therapy ahead of medication-and when it comes to drug treatment, the abundance of generic options available has significantly contributed to halving the value of the branded antidepressant market over recent years. Another hurdle faced by new drugs is the requirement that all antidepressants carry a black-box warning regarding the increased risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young adults, which limits their use in this population. Switching between medications presents both an opportunity and a challenge, as a significant number of patients will switch away from their first medication within the first year of treatment.

All patients underwent ultrasound with measurement of the surface of the median nerve at the entrance of the carpal tunnel and electroneuromyographic examination of both wrists. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound was compared to those of ENMG. The average age of patients was 49.6 years with a clear female predominance (98%). The majority of patients were housewives. Paresthesias were the most common reason for consultation in 86%. Bilateral clinical manifestation occurred in 78% of cases. ENMG showed pathological result in 89 wrists (89%). Ultrasound was abnormal in 63 wrists (63%) with a median surface area of the median nerve of 11 mm<sup>2</sup>. This study highlights an ultrasound sensitivity of 70%, a specificity of 100% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% and a negative predictive value (VPN) of 29.7%.

Among the available treatments, surgical release of the nerve is the most effective and acceptable treatment option. The aim of this study was to see the outcomes of surgical release of carpel tunnel using open technique. This descriptive case series was conducted at the Department of neurosurgery, Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad from April 2013 to March 2014. One hundred consecutive patients with carpel tunnel syndrome were included who underwent open carpel tunnel release surgery. They were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months. Residual pain, numbness and functional improvement of the hand were the main outcome measures. Out of 100 patients, 19 were males. The age ranged from 32 to 50 years with a mean of 39.29\u00b13.99 years. The duration of symptoms was from 5 to 24 months. In the entire series patient functional outcome and satisfaction was 82% at 1 month, 94% at 3 months and 97% at 6 months. 18% patient had residual pain at 1 month post-operative follow-up, 6% at 3 months and 3% at 6 month follow-up. Open carpel tunnel release surgery is an effective procedure for compression neuropathy of the median nerve. It should be offered to all patients with moderate to severe pain and functional disability related to carpel tunnel syndrome.",

However, clinical applicability of this intervention has never been investigated in human subjects. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effect of ES on axonal regeneration after surgery in patients with median nerve compression in the carpal tunnel causing marked motor axonal loss. A randomized control trial was conducted to provide proof of principle for ES-induced acceleration of axon regeneration in human patients. Carpel tunnel release surgery (CTRS) was performed and in the stimulation group of patients, stainless steel electrode wires placed alongside the median nerve proximal to the surgical decompression site for immediate 1 h 20 Hz bipolar ES. Subjects were followed for a year at regular intervals. Axonal regeneration was quantified using motor unit number estimation (MUNE) and sensory and motor nerve conduction studies. Purdue Pegboard Test, Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments, and Levine's Self-Assessment Questionnaire were used to assess functional recovery. The stimulation group had significant axonal regeneration 6-8 months after the CTRS when the MUNE increased to 290+/-140 (mean+/-SD) motor units (MU) from 150+/-62 MU at baseline (p&lt;0.05). In comparison, MUNE did not significantly improve in the control group (p&gt;0.2). Terminal motor latency significantly accelerated in the stimulation group but not the control group (p&gt;0.1). Sensory nerve conduction values significantly improved in the stimulation group earlier than the controls. Other outcome measures showed a significant improvement in both patient groups. We conclude that brief low frequency ES accelerates axonal regeneration and target reinnervation in humans.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17985535": "The declining capacity for injured peripheral nerves to regenerate their axons with time and distance is accounted for, at least in part, by the chronic axotomy of the neurons and Schwann cell denervation prior to target reinnervation. A largely unrecognized site of delay is the surgical suture site where, in rats, 4 weeks is required for all neurons to regenerate their axons across the site. Low frequency stimulation for just 1 h after surgery accelerates this axon crossing in association with upregulation of neurotrophic factors in the neurons. We translated these findings to human patients by examining the number of reinnervated motor units in the median nerve-innervated thenar muscles before and after carpel tunnel release surgery in a randomized controlled trial. Motor unit number estimates (MUNE) in patients with moderate and severe carpal tunnel syndrome were significantly lower than normal. This number increased significantly by 6-8 months after surgery and reached normal values by 12 months in contrast to a non-significant increase in the control unstimulated group. Tests including the Purdue Pegboard Test verified the more rapid functional recovery after stimulation. The data indicate a feasible strategy to promote axonal regeneration in humans that has the potential to improve functional outcomes, especially in combination with strategies to sustain the regenerative capacity of neurons and the support of Schwann cells over distance and time.",

Current non-surgical treatment options (oral medication, corticosteroid injections, splinting, exercise, and mobilization) show limited effects, especially in the long-term. Carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery is effective in 70 to 75% of patients, but is relatively invasive and can be accompanied by complications. In an observational study, mechanical traction proved to be effective in up to 70% of patients directly after treatment and in 60% after two years follow-up. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine the effectiveness of mechanical traction compared to care as usual in CTS. Patients diagnosed with CTS will be recruited from an outpatient neurology clinic and randomly assigned to the intervention group (mechanical traction) or the control group (care as usual). Participants in the intervention group will receive 12 treatments with mechanical traction during six consecutive weeks. Primary outcome is symptom severity and functional status, which are measured with the Boston Carpel Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ). Secondary outcomes are quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), health related resource utilization, and absenteeism from work. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after inclusion. Linear mixed effect models will be used to determine the change from baseline at 12 months on the BCTQ, WHOQOL-BREF, absenteeism from work and health related resource utilization. The baseline measurement, change from baseline at three and six months, as well as duration of symptoms until inclusion, age, gender, and co-morbidity will be included as covariates The Pearson's correlation coefficient will be generated to assess the correlation between depression and anxiety and treatment outcome. Since current non-surgical treatment options are not effective long-term and CTR is relatively invasive, there is a need for an effective and non-invasive treatment option. Mechanical traction is a safe treatment option that may provide a good alternative for the usual care.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7085815": "The carpal tunnel, a narrow space closed distally by the anterior annular ligament of the wrist, and containing flexor tendons and the median nerve, is the most frequent site of tunnel syndromes, compression in the canal leading to medium nerve lesion. The carpal tunnel syndrome usually affects women aged between 40 and 60 years, and presents typically as parasthesia of the fingers, mainly at night, in the regions served by the median nerve, sometimes associated with hypoesthesia and difficulty in movements. Motor disorders, particularly affecting the thumb, occur during the advanced stages. Electrical tests may confirm diagnosis and enable assessment of severity. More than half the cases are idiopathic in nature, presenting as hypertrophy of the annular ligament and fibrous thickening in the canal, but other forms may be observed including those due to wrist injuries, anatomical anomalies, rheumatic affections, or tumours. Associated disorders may be Dupuytren's disease, cubital nerve compression in Guyon's canal, or nodular tendinitis leading to a trigger finger. Surgical treatment is simple and should be employed when medical measures fail. The nerve should therefore be liberated if parasthesia persists after two or three local corticoid infiltrations. After a wide exploratory incision, the nerve is freed along the total length of the canal and up to the distal extremity of the forearm. Results are excellent, 98 p. cent of patients being relieved of their pain. Persistent motor disorders require surgical intervention before amyotrophy and muscle weakness develops.",

With serial stimulation from midpalm to distal forearm the sensory axons normally showed a predictable latency change of 0.16 to 0.21 ms/cm as the stimulus site was moved proximally in 1 cm increments. In 47 (52 per cent) of 91 affected nerves tested serially, there was a sharply localized latency increase across a 1 cm segment, most commonly 2 to 4 cm distally to the origin of the transverse carpal ligament. In these hands, the focal latency change across the affected 1 cm segment (mean +/- SD: 0.80 +/- 0.22 ms/cm) averaged more than four times that of the adjoining distal (0.19 +/- 0.09 ms/cm) or proximal 1 cm segments (0.19 +/- 0.08 ms/cm). In the remaining 44 (48 per cent) hands, the latency increase was distributed more evenly across the carpal tunnel. Unlike the sensory axons the motor axons were difficult to test serially because of the recurrent course of the thenar nerve, which may be contained in a separate tunnel. The wrist-to-palm latency was significantly greater in the patients with carpal tunnel syndromes than in the controls for sensory (2.18 +/- 0.48 ms v 1.41 +/- 0.18 ms) and motor axons (2.79 +/- 0.93 ms v 1.50 +/- 0.21 ms). Consequently, there was considerable difference between the carpal tunnel syndromes and controls in SNCV (38.5 +/- 7.5 m/s v 57.3 +/- 6.9 m/s), and MNCV (28.2 +/- 4.5 m/s v 49.0 +/- 5.7 m/s). In the remaining distal segment, however, there was only a small difference between the two groups in sensory (1.48 +/- 0.28 ms v 1.41 +/- 0.22 ms) and motor latency (2.15 +/- 0.34 ms v 2.10 +/- 0.31 ms). The exclusion of the relatively normal distal latency made it possible to demonstrate mild slowing across the carpal tunnel in 36 (21 per cent) sensory and 40 (23 per cent) motor axons of 172 affected nerves when the conventional terminal latencies were normal. Sensory or motor conduction abnormalities were found in all but 13 (8 per cent) hands. Without palmar stimulation, however, an additional 32 (19 per cent) hands would have been regarded as normal.",

The section of the nerve at or just distal to the distal margin of the carpal tunnel was affected most frequently, the section within the tunnel was affected less often, and the section proximal to the tunnel at the level of the mid-carpal and radio-carpal joints was affected least. The greatest contrast between frequencies of slowing at adjacent segments occurred at the proximal and distal margins of the carpal tunnel. The distribution of the nerve impairment was similar between the sexes; however, among the men the segment affected most frequently was located 1 cm distal to the segment affected most frequently among the women.

Acupuncture is a minimally-invasive and conservative therapeutic option, and while rooted in a complex practice ritual, acupuncture overlaps significantly with many conventional peripherally-focused neuromodulatory therapies. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms by which acupuncture impacts accepted subjective/psychological and objective/physiological outcomes are not well understood. Eligible patients (n = 80, 65 female, age: 49.3 \u00b1 8.6 years) were enrolled and randomized into three intervention arms: (i) verum electro-acupuncture 'local' to the more affected hand; (ii) verum electro-acupuncture at 'distal' body sites, near the ankle contralesional to the more affected hand; and (iii) local sham electro-acupuncture using non-penetrating placebo needles. Acupuncture therapy was provided for 16 sessions over 8 weeks. Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire assessed pain and paraesthesia symptoms at baseline, following therapy and at 3-month follow-up. Nerve conduction studies assessing median nerve sensory latency and brain imaging data were acquired at baseline and following therapy. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed somatotopy in the primary somatosensory cortex using vibrotactile stimulation over three digits (2, 3 and 5). While all three acupuncture interventions reduced symptom severity, verum (local and distal) acupuncture was superior to sham in producing improvements in neurophysiological outcomes, both local to the wrist (i.e. median sensory nerve conduction latency) and in the brain (i.e. digit 2/3 cortical separation distance). Moreover, greater improvement in second/third interdigit cortical separation distance following verum acupuncture predicted sustained improvements in symptom severity at 3-month follow-up. We further explored potential differential mechanisms of local versus distal acupuncture using diffusion tensor imaging of white matter microstructure adjacent to the primary somatosensory cortex. Compared to healthy adults (n = 34, 28 female, 49.7 \u00b1 9.9 years old), patients with carpal tunnel syndrome demonstrated increased fractional anisotropy in several regions and, for these regions we found that improvement in median nerve latency was associated with reduction of fractional anisotropy near (i) contralesional hand area following verum, but not sham, acupuncture; (ii) ipsilesional hand area following local, but not distal or sham, acupuncture; and (iii) ipsilesional leg area following distal, but not local or sham, acupuncture. As these primary somatosensory cortex subregions are distinctly targeted by local versus distal acupuncture electrostimulation, acupuncture at local versus distal sites may improve median nerve function at the wrist by somatotopically distinct neuroplasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex following therapy. Our study further suggests that improvements in primary somatosensory cortex somatotopy can predict long-term clinical outcomes for carpal tunnel syndrome.",

In diabetic individuals, dysregulated inflammation contributes to delayed wound healing. Specific immunomodulatory agents may have a role in the treatment of diabetic wounds. One of these molecules is interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.). Although interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, little is known about the local use this drug in cutaneous wound healing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of locally administered interleukin-1 receptor antagonist on delayed wound healing, specifically, in a diabetic mouse model. Two 6-mm full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsa of diabetic (db/db) mice and stented. One-hour postwounding, wound margins were subcutaneously injected with either (1) low-dose interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in a gelatin-transglutaminase gel vehicle or (2) the gel vehicle only. Wounds were imaged on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 postwounding, and wound area was determined. Wound biopsies were collected on day 21 and immunohistochemically stained for neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Wounds treated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist had significantly smaller wound area than nontreated wounds on day 7 and day 14 postwounding. Treated wounds also showed significantly less neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. These findings support the hypothesis that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist may have an important role in cutaneous wound healing, possibly by promoting successful resolution of acute inflammation and hence accelerating wound closure. Thereby, administration of IL-1Ra may be useful in the treatment of nonhealing wounds.",

In this study, using prostaglandin E2 production as a measure of stimulation, we quantitatively compared the ability of anakinra, as well as that of IL-1Ra delivered by gene transfer, to inhibit the biologic actions of IL-1beta. Human synovial fibroblast cultures were incubated with a range of doses of anakinra or HIG-82 cells genetically modified to constitutively express IL-1Ra. The cultures were then challenged with recombinant human IL-1beta either simultaneously with addition of the source of IL-1Ra or 24 hours later. In a similar manner, the potencies of the two sources of IL-1Ra were compared when human synovial fibroblasts were challenged with IL-1beta produced constitutively by genetically modified cells. No significant difference in inhibitory activity was observed between recombinant protein and IL-1Ra provided by the genetically modified cells, under static culture conditions, even following incubation for 4 days. However, under culture conditions that provided progressive dilution of the culture media, striking differences between these methods of protein delivery became readily apparent.

Compared to adult onset rheumatoid arthritis, its course is more variable. Increasing knowledge of the inflammatory process as well as in molecular genetics and biotechnology has enable the production of new drugs, the biologicals. These are able to specifically block mechanisms of immune activation and thereby interfere with the inflammatory process. An increasing number of biologicals have been tried in clinical studies in adults suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or psoriasis arthritis and a couple of them were already licensed for treatment. Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis by blockade of tumournecrosis-factor (TNF) using the soluble receptor Etanercept or the monoclonal antibodies Infliximab and Adalimumab showed comparable clinical efficacy. Blockade of TNF therefore already reached a certain place in the therapeutic algorythm for treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Currently, only Etanercept is licensed for treatment of active juvenile polyarthritis refractory to methotrexate. Studies using Infliximab and Adalimumab will be completed in the near future. However, antibodies blocking TNF may already be used in patients suffering from active uncontrolled chronic uveitis in whom visual impairment is threatening. TNF blockers may also be indicated in juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. The use of further biologicals, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra, Atlizumab (MRA) blocking the receptor for interleukin-6 or Abatacept, an inhibitory ligand of the co-stimulatory T cell membrane molecule CD28, remain experimental and should be preserved for clinical studies.",

In this state, the virus is apparently benign and can effect stable expression of foreign genes. The large (150 kb) genome of this double-stranded virus has been completely sequenced. Many of its 70 genes can be replaced while still allowing the virus to replicate in at least some cultured cells. Some mutations in the viral genome can compromise the toxicity of the virus and reduce or eliminate its ability to replicate within neurons.

In this process, only one of the two genomic ends are formed on the concatemer. Although the mechanism underlying this asymmetry is not known, one explanation is that single genomes are cleaved off of concatemer ends in a preferred direction. This implies that cis elements control the direction of packaging. Two highly conserved cis elements named pac1 and pac2 lie near opposite ends of herpesvirus genomes and are important for cleavage and packaging. By comparison of published reports and by analysis of two additional herpesviruses, we found that pac2 elements lie near the ends formed on replicative concatemers of four herpesviruses: herpes simplex virus type 1, equine herpesvirus 1, guinea pig cytomegalovirus, and murine cytomegalovirus. Formation of pac2 ends on concatemers depended on terminal cis sequences, since ectopic cleavage sites engineered into the murine cytomegalovirus genome mediated formation of pac2 ends on concatemers regardless of the orientation of their insertion. These findings are consistent with a model in which pac2 elements at concatemer ends impart a directionality to concatemer packaging by binding proteins that initiate insertion of concatemer ends into empty capsids.",

NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are cytoplasmic inflammasome sensors of foreign molecules, including DNA. IFI16, a sequence-independent nuclear innate sensor ALR, recognizes episomal dsDNA genomes of herpes viruses such as KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1 in the infected cell nuclei, forms an inflammasome complex with ASC and procaspase1, and relocates into the cytoplasm leading into Caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 generation. IFI16 also induces IFN-\u03b2 during HSV-1 infection via the cytoplasmic STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway. Thus far, whether IFI16 recognizes foreign DNA directly or utilizes other host protein(s) is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BRCA1, a DNA damage repair sensor and transcription regulator, is in complex with IFI16 in the host cell nucleus, and their association increases in the presence of nuclear viral genomes during de novo KSHV, EBV and HSV-1 infection, and in latent KSHV or EBV infection, but not by DNA damage responses (DDR) induced by bleomycin and vaccinia virus cytoplasmic dsDNA. BRCA1 is a constituent of the triggered IFI16-inflammasome and is translocated into the cytoplasm after genome recognition along with the IFI16-inflammasome. The absence of BRCA1 abrogated IFI16-viral genome association, inflammasome assembly, IFI16 cytoplasmic localization, and Caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 production. The absence of BRCA1 also abolished the cytoplasmic IFI16-STING interaction, downstream IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of pIRF3 and IFN-\u03b2 production during de novo KSHV and HSV-1 infection. These findings highlight that BRCA1 plays a hitherto unidentified innate immunomodulatory role by facilitating nuclear foreign DNA sensing by IFI16, subsequent assembly and cytoplasmic distribution of IFI16-inflammasomes leading into IL-1\u03b2 formation and the induction of IFN-\u03b2 via cytoplasmic signaling through IFI16-STING, TBK1 and IRF3.",

Ensuing DNA synthesis resulted in the generation of head-to-tail concatemers which were subsequently cleaved into monomeric units and packaged into the nascent viral capsid. Recently, however, it has been proposed that circularization of HSV-1 genomes does not occur at the onset of lytic infection and moreover that this event is specifically inhibited by the HSV-1 transcriptional transactivator, ICP0 (S.A. Jackson and N.A. DeLuca, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:7871-7876, 2003). To further investigate genome circularization, we have generated HSV-1 derivatives in which the viral a sequences, which contain the cleavage-packaging signals, have been replaced by a minimal packaging element located in the thymidine kinase gene. In contrast to wild-type HSV-1, fusion of the genomic termini of these viruses produces a novel fragment in circular or concatemeric DNA which can be detected by Southern blot hybridization. Utilizing these viruses, we demonstrate that fusion of the genomic termini occurred rapidly upon infection and in the presence of inhibitors of viral DNA or protein synthesis. We provide evidence indicating that the end joining represented circularization rather than concatemerization of input molecules and that circularized molecules functioned as templates for replication. Since the termini of these viruses lack direct repeats, our findings indicate that circularization can be mediated by direct end-to-end ligation of linear input genomes.",

Here, we have examined the role of mammalian DNA ligases in the herpes simplex virus, type I (HSV-1) life cycle by employing RNA interference (RNAi) in human 1BR.3.N fibroblasts. We find that RNAi-mediated knockdown of DNA ligase IV and its co-factor XRCC4 causes a hundred-fold reduction of virus yield, a small plaque phenotype, and reduced DNA synthesis. The effect is specific because RNAi against DNA ligase I or DNA ligase III fail to reduce HSV-1 replication. Furthermore, RNAi against DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 does not affect replication of adenovirus. In addition, high multiplicity infections of HSV-1 in human DNA ligase IV-deficient cells reveal a pronounced delay of production of infectious virus. Finally, we demonstrate that formation of endless genomes is inhibited by RNAi-mediated depletion of DNA ligase IV and XRCC4. Our results suggests that DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 serves an important role in the replication cycle of herpes viruses and is likely to be required for the formation of the endless genomes early during productive infection.",

Of the other human herpes viruses it is most closely related to the herpes simplex viruses (also members of the Alphalerpesvirinae). Like all herpes viruses, the virus has a large double-stranded DNA genome within an icosahedral nucleocapsid. This is surrounded by a proteinaceous tegument and a trilaminar membrane derived from host-cell membranes into which the viral glycoproteins are inserted. The structure of the virion is summarized in Fig. 1.",

The first line treatment is lifestyle modification to weight-loss, but for those who fail to achieve the goal or have difficulty in maintaining achieved results, pharmacological treatment is needed. Few drugs are available today, because of their side effects. We aim to review actual pharmacological management of obese patients, highlighting differences between Food and Drug Administration - and European Medicine Agency-approved molecules, and pointing out self-medications readily obtainable and widely distributed. Papers on obesity, weight loss, pharmacotherapy, self- medication and diet-aid products were selected using Medline. Research articles, systematic reviews, clinical trials and meta-analyses were screened. Anti-obesity drugs with central mechanisms, such as phentermine and lorcaserin, are available in USA, but not in Europe. Phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion combinations are now available, even though the former is still under investigation from EMA. Orlistat, with peripheral mechanisms, represents the only drug approved for weight reduction in adolescents. Liraglutide has been approved at higher dose for obesity. Anti-obesity drugs, readily obtainable from the internet, include crude-drug products and supplements for which there is often a lack of compliance to national regulatory standards. Mechanisms of weight loss drugs include the reduction of energy intake or the increase in energy expenditure and sense of satiety as well as the decrease of hunger or the reduction in calories absorption. Few drugs are approved, and differences exist between USA and Europe. Moreover, herbal medicines and supplements often sold on the internet and widely used by obese patients, present a risk of adverse effects.",

Through the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim at critically appraising and summarizing those RCTs, providing precise effect estimates. We searched major databases and grey literature from their inception to October 2018, for RCTs with a duration \u2265 12 weeks, comparing liraglutide with placebo or any other comparator as adjunct to insulin in patients with T1D, investigating major efficacy and safety endpoints. This review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We included 5 trials with 2,445 randomized participants. Liraglutide provided modest reductions in HbA1c, with liraglutide 1.8 mg producing the greatest decrease (MD = -0.24%, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.16, I2=0%). Significant weight reduction, up to 4.87 kg with liraglutide 1.8 mg was also observed (95% CI -5.31 to -4.43, I2=0%). Decrease in total daily insulin dose, primarily driven by a decrease in bolus insulin requirements, was demonstrated. Liraglutide decreased non-significantly the odds for severe hypoglycemia (OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.57-1.14, I2=0%), while it increased significantly the odds for gastrointestinal adverse events (for nausea, OR=4.70, 95% CI 3.68-6.00, I2=37%, and for vomiting, OR=2.50, 95% CI 1.54-4.72, I2=27%). A significant increase in heart rate was also demonstrated. No association with diabetic ketoacidosis or malignancies was identified. In patients with T1D, liraglutide might prove be an adjunct to insulin, improving glycemic control, inducing body weight loss and decreasing exogenous insulin requirements and severe hypoglycemia.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202085": "As a chronic and relapsing disease, obesity negatively impacts the health of men to a greater extent than that of women, with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Since lifestyle modifications alone are often challenging and limited for the maintenance of weight reduction, pharmacotherapy should be considered in a timely manner for obese men or overweight patients with weight-related comorbidities. Recent advances in anti-obesity drugs have enabled the potential of achieving clinically significant weight loss. Increasing evidence has shown that behavior-based interventions with one of these medications can result in greater weight loss than that elicited by usual care conditions. Data from most recent meta-analyses showed that the overall placebo-subtracted weight reduction (%) with the use of anti-obesity drugs for at least 12 months ranges from 2.9% to 6.8%; phentermine/topiramate (-6.8%) liraglutide (-5.4%), naltrexone/bupropion (-4.0%), lorcaserin (-3.1%), and orlistat (-2.9%). However, they have a high cost and may cause adverse outcomes depending on the individual. Very recently, on February 13, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration requested withdrawal of lorcaserin from the market because a safety clinical trial showed an increased occurrence of cancer. Therefore the decision to initiate drug therapy in obese individuals should be made after the benefits and risks are considered. Thereafter, treatment should be tailored to specific patient subpopulations depending on their chronic conditions, comorbidities, and preferences. Herein, we provide an overview of the latest developments in weight loss medications, which may serve as one of the strategies for long-term obesity control.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410565": " The increase in global obesity rates over the past three decades has been remarkable, a true epidemic, both in developed and in developing countries. The projections, based on current trends, suggest an increase in the prevalence of obesity at 60% in adult men, 40% in adult women and 25% in children in 2050. Given the limitations of lifestyle and surgery interventions bariatric, drug therapy approaches for the treatment of obesity, therefore become important options. The purpose of this review is a review of the literature, based on research on MEDLINE until 2019, on the possible pharmacological options in the treatment of obesity. Currently, the FDA has approved several molecules for the treatment of obesity, both in monotherapy and in combination. Pharmacological monotherapies focus mainly on a single protein target and include orlistat, lorcaserin and liraglutide while the combination molecules propose a multitarget approach and include phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion. All the approved drugs showed, in the different studies, a weight reduction of at least 5%, compared to placebo, in 52 weeks of observation. Phentermine-topiramate and liraglutide have been associated with the highest probability of at least 5% weight loss. Liraglutide and naltrexone-bupropion had the lowest rates of therapy discontinuation due to adverse events. The drugs, associated with the standard diet and/or exercise protocols, represent a good therapeutic opportunity to allow not only weight loss but also to reduce the risk of developing diseases caused by obesity, particularly cardiovascular diseases, and to maintain the set objectives over time. However, future research on the pharmacological treatment of obesity should encourage greater personalization of therapy, given the differences in safety, efficacy and response to therapy, in the different subpopulations of patients with obesity.",

Currently, high-dose liraglutide has been used for weight control in non-diabetic patients. Considering incretin-based therapy is more effective in Asian populations, the effect of low-dose liraglutide in weight control among these non-diabetic groups has not been well evaluated. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose liraglutide in weight control among Taiwan patients. From July 2017 to December 2018, 46 non-diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome were included. They had received low-dose liraglutide at 0.6 or 1.2 mg per day for weight reduction for 12 weeks. After then, changes in bodyweight, waist and metabolic factors were examined. Overt bodyweight reduction was defined as a decrease of &gt;5% within 12 weeks. With 12 weeks of medication use, both groups showed statistical weight reduction. Higher doses of liraglutide had better efficacy, and 44.4% of patients in the liraglutide 1.2 mg group reached overt weight reduction, whereas just 32.1% in the 0.6 mg group had achieved this. Young age was found to be a predictor factor for a positive finding (odds ratio 0.941, P = 0.037). Early responders with decreased bodyweight of &gt;4.2% within the first 4 weeks indicated a better chance to achieve measurable weight reduction. Low-dose liraglutide still has high efficacy in weight reduction in Taiwanese people, especially for those of younger age.",

However, long-term effect of liraglutide on body weight and glycemic control has not been elucidated in Japanese type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects. Present study investigates whether liraglutide treatment maintains the body weight-decreasing and glucose-lowering effects for 2 years in Japanese T2D subjects. The enrolled subjects were 86 T2D patients [age; 59.8 \u00b1 12.8 years, duration of diabetes; 15.8 \u00b1 9.5 years, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); 8.5 \u00b1 1.5%, body mass index (BMI); 27.3 \u00b1 5.4 kg/m(2) (15.8 - 46.5 kg/m(2)), mean \u00b1 SD]. Among 86 subjects, liraglutide was introduced in 25 inpatients and 61 outpatients, and 46 subjects were followed for 2 years. Clinical parameters were measured at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after liraglutide introduction. The increase in liraglutide dosage and the additional usage of glucose-lowering agents depended on each attending physician. At 1 year after liraglutide introduction, 69 patients (80.2%) decreased body weight and 58 patients (67.4%) improved glycemic control. Body mass index (BMI) was changed 27.3 \u00b1 5.4 kg/m(2) to 25.9 \u00b1 4.8 kg/m(2) and percent reduction of body weight was significant and maintained over 4% at 2 years after liraglutide introduction. HbA1c was significantly decreased from 8.5 \u00b1 1.5% to 7.7 \u00b1 1.2% for 2 years. Liraglutide treatment tended to ameliorate lipid profile and hepatic enzymes. Stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that baseline BMI and previous insulin dose were positively associated with body weight reduction and baseline HbA1c was positively associated with reduction of HbA1c at 2 years after liraglutide introduction. Long-term liraglutide treatment effectively maintained the reduction of body weight and the fair glycemic control, and also improved lipid profile and liver enzymes in Japanese T2D subjects.",

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a new class of OADs that have also been shown to be effective in T2DM patients inadequately controlled with OADs. Currently there are no head-to-head RCTs comparing these to liraglutide. We aimed to evaluate the relative efficacy, using network meta-analysis (NMA), of treatment intensification with liraglutide and SGLT-2 inhibitors people with T2DM who have been treated with metformin (alone or in combination with SU, DPP-4, and TZD). We performed a systematic literature review to identify relevant RCTs comparing liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg), canagliflozin (100 and 300 mg), empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg), or dapagliflozin (5 and 10 mg) to placebo. To strengthen the indirect evidence base, we also included non-placebo RCTs where sitagliptin (100 mg) was the active comparator. Bayesian NMA was performed on the following outcomes to assess the relative efficacy and safety of interventions: reduction (change) in HbA1c, weight, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) as well as proportion reaching target HbA1c (&lt;7%), and risk of hypoglycemia. Doses for each intervention were considered separately. A total of 16 RCTs were identified. All trials were similar with respect to important baseline characteristics and study design. Both doses of liraglutide were generally statistically significantly superior to the SGLT-2s with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c and FPG as well as odds of reaching target HbA1c &lt;7%. For weight, canagliflozin 300 mg was superior to liraglutide 1.2 mg, and SGLT-2s were generally associated with larger change from baseline in weight. For risk of major or minor hypoglycemia, no differences were found between treatments. Compared to SGLT-2 inhibitors, liraglutide offers improvement in HbA1c and FPG. Reductions in weight are likely comparable between liraglutide and SGLT-2s. Liraglutide did not differ from SGLT-2s in terms of risk of hypoglycemia. Given the lack of head-to-head evidence, this analysis provides valuable insight into the comparative outcomes of liraglutide versus SGLT-2 inhibitors.",

A systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane library databases were performed. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with T2DM who received the combination treatment of liraglutide and metformin. Pooled estimates were performed using a fixed-effects model or random-effects model. A total of nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control (placebo, sitagliptin, glimepiride, dulaglutide, insulin glargine, and NPH), liraglutide in combination with metformin resulted in significant reductions in HbA1c, bodyweight, FPG, and PPG, and similar reductions in SBP, and DBP. Moreover, liraglutide combined with metformin did not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, but induced a higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirmed the use of liraglutide as add-on to metformin appeared to be effective and safe for patients with T2DM.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether metformin as an adjunct to low-dose LIRA affects body weight with increased efficacy compared with low-dose LIRA alone in obese patients with PCOS. In a 12-week study, 44 obese women with PCOS were randomly offered either combined treatment (COMBO) with 1,000 mg metformin twice a day and 1.2 mg LIRA once a day, or treatment with 1.2 mg LIRA alone.

Besides lowering blood glucose, liraglutide also reduces body weight. It is not fully understood how liraglutide induces weight loss or to what degree liraglutide acts directly in the brain. Here, we determined that liraglutide does not activate GLP-1-producing neurons in the hindbrain, and liraglutide-dependent body weight reduction in rats was independent of GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) in the vagus nerve, area postrema, and paraventricular nucleus. Peripheral injection of fluorescently labeled liraglutide in mice revealed the presence of the drug in the circumventricular organs. Moreover, labeled liraglutide bound neurons within the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and other discrete sites in the hypothalamus. GLP-1R was necessary for liraglutide uptake in the brain, as liraglutide binding was not seen in Glp1r(-/-) mice. In the ARC, liraglutide was internalized in neurons expressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). Electrophysiological measurements of murine brain slices revealed that GLP-1 directly stimulates POMC/CART neurons and indirectly inhibits neurotransmission in neurons expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) via GABA-dependent signaling. Collectively, our findings indicate that the GLP-1R on POMC/CART-expressing ARC neurons likely mediates liraglutide-induced weight loss.",

Upon injection, liraglutide binds non-covalently to albumin, giving it a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once-daily administration. In clinical trials of up to 1 year duration, liraglutide has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on islet cell function, leading to improvements in glycemic control. Both fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations are lowered, and are associated with lasting reductions in HbA1c levels. Liraglutide is effective as monotherapy and in combination therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs, and reduces HbA1c by up to approximately 1.5% from baseline (8.2%-8.4%). Because of the glucose-dependency of its action, there is a low incidence of hypoglycemia. Liraglutide is associated with body weight loss, and reductions in systolic blood pressure have been observed throughout the clinical trials. The most common adverse events reported with liraglutide are gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea). These tend to be most pronounced during the initial period of therapy and decline with time. Further clinical experience with liraglutide will reveal its long-term durability, safety and efficacy.",

In this randomized, double-blind trial, which consisted of a 56-week treatment period and a 26-week follow-up period, we enrolled adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years of age) with obesity and a poor response to lifestyle therapy alone. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide (3.0 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once daily, in addition to lifestyle therapy. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) standard-deviation score at week 56. A total of 125 participants were assigned to the liraglutide group and 126 to the placebo group.

The dose of liraglutide was increased weekly from 0.5 to 2 mg OD. Liraglutide added to metformin monotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in fasting serum glucose (FSG) (-3.9 mM -4.9; -2.9) (primary objective), and HbA1c levels (-0.8% -1.2; -0.4). Furthermore, liraglutide in combination with metformin vs. metformin plus glimepiride significantly reduced FSG (-1.2 mM -2.2; -0.2). In addition, body weight was significantly lower in the metformin plus liraglutide vs. the metformin plus glimepiride group (-2.9 kg -3.6; -2.1). There were no biochemically confirmed episodes of hypoglycaemia with liraglutide treatment. Nausea was the most frequently reported adverse event following liraglutide therapy, it was transient in nature, and led to withdrawal of only 4% of the subjects. Using a weekly dose-titration liraglutide is well tolerated up to 2 mg daily. While liraglutide caused transient gastrointestinal side effects, this rarely interfered with continuing treatment. An improvement in FSG over that in control groups was seen for liraglutide as an add-on to metformin. In the latter case, body weight was reduced in comparison to metformin plus glimepiride. Liraglutide is a promising drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomized controlled trials that compared lorcaserin with other interventions or no treatment in adults. We performed descriptive synthesis of all included studies and conducted meta-analysis of trials that reported new cases of cancer. From 11 trials, comprising 21,299 individuals, four studies were included in the meta-analysis and reported 476 cases of cancer in 10,342 subjects in the lorcaserin group and 438 among 9429 individuals randomized to placebo (relative risk [RR]: 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.96-1.23). The result was heavily influenced by the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial. In this study, the lorcaserin group had a higher risk of lung and pancreatic but not colon cancer. Overall risk of bias was low, and quality of evidence was moderate. The current evidence does not confirm the increased risk of cancer with lorcaserin but suggests a trend in this direction, with a greater incidence of some subtypes such as lung and pancreas.",

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of eflornithine and sulindac, as compared with either drug alone, in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis. The patients were stratified on the basis of anatomical site with the highest polyp burden and surgical status; the strata were precolectomy (shortest projected time to disease progression), rectal or ileal pouch polyposis after colectomy (longest projected time), and duodenal polyposis (intermediate projected time). The patients were then randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 750 mg of eflornithine, 150 mg of sulindac, or both once daily for up to 48 months. The primary end point, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was disease progression, defined as a composite of major surgery, endoscopic excision of advanced adenomas, diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia in the rectum or pouch, or progression of duodenal disease. A total of 171 patients underwent randomization. Disease progression occurred in 18 of 56 patients (32%) in the eflornithine-sulindac group, 22 of 58 (38%) in the sulindac group, and 23 of 57 (40%) in the eflornithine group, with a hazard ratio of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 1.32) for eflornithine-sulindac as compared with sulindac (P = 0.29) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.24) for eflornithine-sulindac as compared with eflornithine.

The relevant randomized controlled trials were retrieved from PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Network meta-analyses were used to compare multiple drugs simultaneously for the outcomes of nmCRPC. Direct evidence in trials and indirect evidence across trials were combined by the network meta-analyses to estimate the treatment efficiency. Eight studies were included in our research. For prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival, the rate of progression was significantly decreased following apalutamide, enzalutamide, bicalutamide+dutasteride, and bicalutamide treatment compared with placebo. Compared with placebo treatment, metastases-free survival was significantly increased in patients who received apalutamide (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23-0.35), enzalutamide (HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.24-0.35), and darolutamide (HR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.35-0.50).

With respect to metastases-free survival, based on SUCRA analysis, there was 80% and 78% probability that apalutamide and enzalutamide were preferred treatment, while darolutamide was likely to be second-best choice. Compared with placebo, all agents were not associated with significantly higher likelihood of serious adverse events and grade 3 to 4 adverse events.

DDR deficiencies can promote tumorigenesis but concurrently may increase dependence on alternative repair pathways. The ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase plays a central role in the DDR by activating essential signaling pathways of DNA damage repair. Here, we studied the effect of the novel selective ATR kinase inhibitor BAY 1895344 on tumor cell growth and viability. Potent antiproliferative activity was demonstrated in a broad spectrum of human tumor cell lines. BAY 1895344 exhibited strong monotherapy efficacy in cancer xenograft models that carry DNA damage repair deficiencies. The combination of BAY 1895344 with DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) showed synergistic antitumor activity. Combination treatment with BAY 1895344 and DDR inhibitors achieved strong synergistic antiproliferative activity <i>in vitro</i>, and combined inhibition of ATR and PARP signaling using olaparib demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity <i>in vivo</i> Furthermore, the combination of BAY 1895344 with the novel, nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist darolutamide resulted in significantly improved antitumor efficacy compared with respective single-agent treatments in hormone-dependent prostate cancer, and addition of EBRT resulted in even further enhanced antitumor efficacy. Thus, the ATR inhibitor BAY 1895344 may provide new therapeutic options for the treatment of cancers with certain DDR deficiencies in monotherapy and in combination with DNA damage-inducing or DNA repair-compromising cancer therapies by improving their efficacy.",

Increased expression of the enzyme aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is phenotypic of CRPC. The enzyme acts to circumvent castration by producing potent androgens that drive proliferation. Furthermore, AKR1C3 mediates chemotherapeutic resistance to the standard of care, enzalutamide, a structural analogue of apalutamide. Resistance develops in almost all CRPC patients within three months of beginning treatment. Herein, we report that both apalutamide and the structurally distinct darolutamide induce AKR1C3 expression in <i>in vitro</i> models of prostate cancer and are susceptible to AKR1C3-mediated resistance. This effect is countered by pretreatment with a potent and highly selective AKR1C3 inhibitor, sensitizing high AKR1C3 expressing prostate cancer cell lines to the action of both chemotherapeutics with a concomitant reduction in expression of AKR1C3 and the biomarker prostate-specific antigen.",

Most significantly, enzalutamide can prolong not only overall survival time and metastatic free survival time for patients with lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but also castration-resistant free survival time for patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC). Enzalutamide has thus been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of both metastatic (in 2012) and non-metastatic (in 2018) CRPC, as well as CSPC (2019). This is an inspiring drug discovery story created by an amazing interdisciplinary collaboration. Equally important, the successful clinical use of enzalutamide proves the notion that the second-generation AR antagonists can serve as hormonal therapeutics for three forms of advanced prostate cancer. This has been further verified by the recent FDA approval of the other two second-generation AR antagonists, apalutamide and darolutamide, for the treatment of prostate cancer. This review focuses on the rational design and discovery of these three second-generation AR antagonists, and then highlights their syntheses, clinical studies, and use.

Despite these advances, resistance occurs frequently and there is currently no definitive cure for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our previous studies identified that similar mechanisms of resistance to enzalutamide or abiraterone occur following treatment and cross-resistance exists between these therapies in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we show that enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells are further cross-resistant to apalutamide and darolutamide. Mechanistically, we have determined that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 axis confers this cross-resistance. Knockdown of AR-V7 in enzalutamide-resistant cells resensitize cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment. Furthermore, targeting AKR1C3 resensitizes resistant cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment through AR-V7 inhibition. Chronic apalutamide treatment in C4-2B cells activates the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway and increases AKR1C3 expression, which confers resistance to enzalutamide, abiraterone, and darolutamide. In conclusion, our results suggest that apalutamide and darolutamide share similar resistant mechanisms with enzalutamide and abiraterone.

The key aims of the experiment were to examine darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide with respect to (a) assessment of in vitro metabolic stability and protein binding and (b) characterization of in vivo oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics in mice. In vitro (liver microsomes stability and protein binding) and in vivo experiments (oral/intravenous dosing to mice) were carried out using darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,Rdarolutamide. Besides, tissue levels of darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide were measured following oral and intravenous dosing. Appropriate plasma/tissue samples served to determine the pharmacokinetics of various analytes in mice. Liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry procedures enabled the delineation of the plasma pharmacokinetics, in vitro and tissue uptake data of the various analytes. Chiral inversion was absent in the metabolic stability study. However, darolutamide showed profound stereoselectivity (S,S-darolutamide greater than S,R-darolutamide) after either intravenous or oral dosing. S,R-darolutamide but not S,S-darolutamide showed conversion to its antipode post oral and intravenous dosing to mice. Regardless of oral or intravenous dosing, active keto darolutamide formation was evident after administration of darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide or S,R- darolutamide. Tissue data supported the observations in plasma; however, tissue exposure of darolutamide, S,Sdarolutamide and S,R-darolutamide was much lower as compared to plasma. In lieu of the human pharmacokinetic data, although the administration of diastereomeric darolutamide was justified, it is proposed to delineate the clinical pharmacokinetics of S,Rdarolutamide and S,S-darolutamide relative to darolutamide in future clinical pharmacology studies.",

We performed a systematic review of phase III parallel-group randomized controlled trials in adult men with nmCRPC. Primary outcome was metastasis-free survival (MFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS), and rates of grade 3 to 4 adverse events (AEs). We assessed class-level effects using random effects models; effect modification owing to subgroup effects using random-effects models to pool study-level differences; and comparative outcomes between agents using fixed-effect network models in a Bayesian framework. Three randomized controlled trials were identified. Pooled MFS, PSA-PFS, and OS were significantly greater with NSAA versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.41; HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.05-0.13; and HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90, respectively).

Bayesian analysis showed apalutamide and enzalutamide had a 56% and 44% likelihood of maximizing MFS, respectively, with subgroup analysis demonstrating these agents were preferred regardless of PSA doubling time and performance status. There was a 44%, 41%, and 15% likelihood that apalutamide, darolutamide and enzalutamide offered the greatest OS benefit, respectively.

This treatment has a novel chemical structure that may also have safety, tolerability, and efficacy advantages for men with nmCRPC. <b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To estimate the projected budget impact of including darolutamide on a U.S. payer formulary as a treatment option for men with nmCRPC. <b>METHODS:</b> A budget impact model was developed to evaluate darolutamide for nmCRPC for a hypothetical 1-million-member plan over a 5-year period. Costs (drug acquisition, drug administration, and treatment-related adverse events [AEs]) were estimated for 2 scenarios: with and without darolutamide treatment for nmCRPC. The budget impact of darolutamide was calculated as the difference in costs for these 2 scenarios. An analysis for high-risk nmCRPC also was conducted. The model included treatments recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (e.g., apalutamide and enzalutamide) and potential comparators that are used but are not specifically indicated for nmCRPC. All treatments were assumed to be administered in combination with a weighted average androgen deprivation therapy comparator (consisting of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists, LHRH antagonists, and first-generation antiandrogens). Market share estimates were derived from interviews with physicians treating men with nmCRPC. The model includes grade 3-4 AEs, and the rates were obtained from clinical trial data. Costs were taken from publicly available sources and varied in a one-way sensitivity analysis. <b>RESULTS:</b> For a plan with 1 million lives, there were approximately 90 incident cases of nmCRPC (46 high risk) each year, with 332 (109 high risk) treatment-eligible cases by year 5. Darolutamide's market share increased from 3.6% in year 1 to 18% in year 5. Given the utilization of other agents, introducing darolutamide along with other targeted therapies was predicted to increase the total budget by $158,640 ($0.0132 per member per month [PMPM]) in year 1, which decreased over time to a cost savings of $149,240 ($0.0124 PMPM) by year 5. The scenario with darolutamide showed reduced AE costs each year. Similar results were observed for the high-risk nmCRPC population. <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Adding darolutamide to a U.S. payer formulary for the treatment of nmCRPC can result in a manageable increase in the budget that is partly offset by AE costs in the first 4 years, followed by a cost savings by year 5. <b>DISCLOSURES:</b> This study was conducted by RTI Health Solutions under the direction of Bayer U.S. and was funded by Bayer U.S., which was involved in the design of the study; collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data; writing of the report; and the decision to submit the report for publication.

Preclinical/phase I study data suggest darolutamide has a low DDI potential-other than breast cancer resistance protein/organic anion transporter protein substrates (e.g., statins), no clinically relevant effect on comedications is expected. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of commonly administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide and the effect of comedications potentially affected by darolutamide on safety in patients with nmCRPC. Comorbidities and comedication use in the 1509 ARAMIS participants treated with darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo were assessed. A population pharmacokinetic analysis evaluated whether comedications affected the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide in a subset of 388 patients. A subgroup analysis of adverse events (AEs) in statin users versus nonusers was conducted. Most participants (median age 74 years) had at least one comorbidity (98.4% in both arms) and used at least one comedication (98.7% with darolutamide vs. 98.0% with placebo); these were similar across study arms. Despite frequent use of comedications with DDI potential, no significant effects on darolutamide pharmacokinetics were identified. Comedications included lipid-modifying agents (34.5%), \u03b2-blockers (29.7%), antithrombotics (42.8%), and systemic antibiotics (26.9%). AE incidence was similar across study arms in statin users and nonusers. Study limitations include the small sample size for sub-analyses. These analyses suggest the pharmacokinetic profile of darolutamide is not affected by a number of commonly administered drugs in patients with nmCRPC. Although pharmacokinetic data have indicated that darolutamide has the potential to interact with rosuvastatin, used to assess DDI in these studies, this finding did not seem to translate into increased AEs due to statin use in the ARAMIS trial.

Efficacy and safety of darolutamide in Japanese patients are reported here. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial, 1509 patients with nmCRPC and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time \u2264 10 months were randomized 2:1 to darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or matched placebo while continuing androgen deprivation therapy. The primary endpoint was MFS. In Japan, 95 patients were enrolled and randomized to darolutamide (n = 62) or placebo (n = 33). At the primary analysis (cut-off date: September 3, 2018), after 20 primary end-point events had occurred, median MFS was not reached with darolutamide vs. 18.2 months with placebo (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.70). Median OS was not reached due to limited numbers of events in both groups but favored darolutamide in the Japanese subgroup. Time to pain progression, time to PSA progression, and PSA response also favored darolutamide. Among Japanese patients randomized to darolutamide vs. placebo, incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 85.5 vs. 63.6%, and incidences of treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs were 8.1 vs. 6.1%. Efficacy outcomes favored darolutamide in Japanese patients with nmCRPC, supporting the clinical benefit of darolutamide in this patient population. Darolutamide was well tolerated; however, due to the small sample size, it is impossible to conclude with certainty whether differences in the safety profile exist between Japanese and overall ARAMIS populations.",

Here, we evaluate the activity of darolutamide in enzalutamide-resistant castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as well as in AR mutants detected in patients after treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone, or bicalutamide. Darolutamide significantly inhibited cell growth and AR transcriptional activity in enzalutamide-resistant MR49F cells in vitro, and led to decreased tumor volume and serum prostate-specific antigen levels in vivo, prolonging survival in mice bearing enzalutamide-resistant MR49F xenografts. Moreover, darolutamide inhibited the transcriptional activity of AR mutants identified in the plasma of CRPC patients progressing on traditional therapies. In particular, darolutamide significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the F877L, H875Y/T878A, F877L/T878A, and the previously unreported T878G AR mutants, that transform enzalutamide into a partial agonist. In silico cheminformatics computer modeling provided atomic level insights confirming darolutamide antagonist effect in F877L and T878G AR mutants. In conclusion, our results provide a rationale for further clinical evaluation of darolutamide in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC, in particular in combination with circulating tumor DNA assays that detect AR mutants sensitive to darolutamide, in a precision oncology setting. In this study we evaluated the novel drug darolutamide in preclinical models of prostate cancer. We found that darolutamide delays growth of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer, in particular in cells with mutated forms of the androgen receptor after previous treatment. Our data supports further evaluation of darolutamide in clinical trials.",

Non-metastatic disease was defined as the absence of metastases, using conventional imaging rather than the substantially more sensitive PSMA scans. The effect of darolutamide is similar to that of other androgen inhibitors, such as apalutamide and enzalutamide. The value of the current trial to Dutch clinical practice is limited, as the number of patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer is low due to the increased use of PSMA scans and the reluctance of urologists to start androgen-deprivation therapy in the absence of metastatic disease.",

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases, for studies reporting apalutamide, enzalutamide, or darolutamide until January 25, 2020. Results were input into an EndNote library, and data were extracted into a predefined template. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as radiologic progression or death.

Accordingly, the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of darolutamide was investigated in both nonclinical and clinical studies. In vitro studies were performed to determine the potential for darolutamide to be a substrate, inducer or inhibitor for cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, other metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. A phase I drug-interaction study in healthy volunteers evaluated the impact of co-administering rifampicin [CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducer] and itraconazole [CYP3A4, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor] on the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide. Two further phase I studies assessed the impact of co-administering oral darolutamide on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) and dabigatran etexilate (P-gp substrate) and the impact on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered rosuvastatin [a substrate for BCRP, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 and organic anion transporter (OAT)3]. In vitro, darolutamide was predominantly metabolized via oxidative biotransformation catalyzed by CYP3A4 and was identified as a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. The enzymatic activity of nine CYP isoforms was not inhibited or slightly inhibited in vitro with darolutamide, and a rank order and mechanistic static assessment indicated that risk of clinically relevant DDIs via CYP inhibition is very low. In vitro, darolutamide exhibited no relevant induction of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 activity. Inhibition of BCRP-, P-gp-, OAT3-, MATE1-, MATE2-K-, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport was observed in vitro. Phase I data showed that darolutamide exposure increased 1.75-fold with co-administered itraconazole and decreased by 72% with rifampicin. Co-administration of darolutamide with CYP3A4/P-gp substrates showed no effect or only minor effects. Rosuvastatin exposure increased 5.2-fold with darolutamide because of BCRP and probably also OATPB1/OATPB3 inhibition. Darolutamide has a low potential for clinically relevant DDIs with drugs that are substrates for CYP or P-gp; increased exposure of BCRP and probably OATP substrates was the main interaction of note.",

Cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) were analyzed in a RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) patient and a CCDC6-RET fusion NSCLC patient who had dramatic response to selpercatinib and later developed resistance. Selpercatinib-resistant RET mutants were identified and cross-profiled with pralsetinib in cell cultures. Crystal structures of RET-selpercatinib and RET-pralsetinib complexes were determined based on high-resolution diffraction data collected with synchrotron radiation. RET<sup>G810C/S</sup> mutations at the solvent front and RET<sup>Y806C/N</sup> mutation at the hinge region were found in cfDNAs of an MTC patient with RET<sup>M918T/V804M/L</sup>, who initially responded to selpercatinib and developed resistance. RET<sup>G810C</sup> mutant was detected in cfDNAs of a CCDC6-RET-fusion NSCLC patient who developed acquired resistance to selpercatinib. Five RET kinase domain mutations at three non-gatekeeper residues were identified from 39 selpercatinib-resistant cell lines. All five selpercatinib-resistant RET mutants were cross-resistant to pralsetinib. X-ray crystal structures of the RET-selpercatinib and RET-pralsetinib complexes reveal that, unlike other TKIs, these two RET TKIs anchor one end in the front cleft and wrap around the gate wall to access the back cleft. RET mutations at the solvent front and the hinge are resistant to both drugs.

However, the mechanisms of resistance to these agents have not yet been described. Analysis was performed of circulating tumor DNA and tissue in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC and RET-mutation positive MTC who developed disease progression after an initial response to selpercatinib. Acquired resistance was modeled preclinically using a CCDC6-RET fusion-positive NSCLC patient-derived xenograft. The inhibitory activity of anti-RET multikinase inhibitors and selective RET TKIs was evaluated in enzyme and cell-based assays. After a dramatic initial response to selpercatinib in a patient with KIF5B-RET NSCLC, analysis of circulating tumor DNA revealed emergence of RET G810R, G810S, and G810C mutations in the RET solvent front before the emergence of clinical resistance. Postmortem biopsy studies reported intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity with distinct disease subclones containing G810S, G810R, and G810C mutations in multiple disease sites indicative of convergent evolution on the G810 residue resulting in a common mechanism of resistance. Acquired mutations in RET G810 were identified in tumor tissue from a second patient with CCDC6-RET fusion-positive NSCLC and in plasma from patients with additional RET fusion-positive NSCLC and RET-mutant MTC progressing on an ongoing phase 1 and 2 trial of selpercatinib. Preclinical studies reported the presence of RET G810R mutations in a CCDC6-RET patient-derived xenograft (from a patient with NSCLC) model of acquired resistance to selpercatinib. Structural modeling predicted that these mutations sterically hinder the binding of selpercatinib, and in vitro assays confirmed loss of activity for both anti-RET multikinase inhibitors and selective RET TKIs. RET G810 solvent front mutations represent the first described recurrent mechanism of resistance to selective RET inhibition with selpercatinib. Development of potent inhibitor of these mutations and maintaining activity against RET gatekeeper mutations could be an effective strategy to target resistance to selective RET inhibitors.",

The treatment of sHTG syndromes is challenging because conventional treatments are often ineffective in reducing TG under the threshold to prevent acute pancreatitis (AP). The inhibition of <i>APOC3</i>, which encodes a protein involved in triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs) removal, has been reported to be a novel target for the treatment of sHTG. Volanesorsen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide inhibiting apoC-III transcription/translation that has been recently approved in Europe for Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) treatment. This review summarizes the evidences on the efficacy and safety of volanesorsen for the treatment of sHTG syndromes. Volanesorsen effectively reduces TG in sHTG through a mechanism that is mainly LPL-independent, potentially decreasing the risk of AP. Some safety concerns have been raised with the use of volanesorsen, mainly represented by the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. Due to the potential severity of side effects, some caution is needed before affirming the long-term utility of this drug.

Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of lipid metabolism characterised by high levels of triglycerides (TGs) due to failure of chylomicron clearance. It causes repeated episodes of severe abdominal pain, fatigue and attacks of acute pancreatitis. There are few current options for its long-term management. The only universal long-term therapy is restriction of total dietary fat intake to &lt;10-15% of daily calories (15 to 20g per day). Many patients have been treated with fibrates and statins with a variable response, but many remain susceptible to pancreatitis. Other genetic syndromes associated with hypertriglyceridaemia include familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD). Targeting apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3) offers the ability to increase clearance of chylomicrons and other triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Volanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibitor of apoC3, which reduces TG levels by 70-80% which has been shown also to reduce rates of pancreatitis and improve well-being in FCS and reduce TGs and improve insulin resistance in FPLD. It is now undergoing licensing and payer reviews.

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Moreover, severe HTG results in an elevated risk of pancreatitis, especially in severe HTG with an up to 350-fold increased risk. Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG lowering. Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3 inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx</sub>, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions.

ApoCIII gain-of-function mutations are associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD), and contribute to the development of cardiometabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in ApoCIII are associated with lower levels of plasma triglycerides (TG), attenuation of vascular inflammatory processes such as monocyte adhesion and endothelial dysfunction, and potentially, a reduction in the incidence and progression of atherosclerosis and cardioprotection. Evidence is now emerging that volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide drug targeting ApoCIII messenger RNA resulting in decreases in TG in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic dyslipidemia with type 2 diabetes giving support to the hypothesis that ApoCIII is a powerful inhibitor of LPL, and when reduced, endogenous clearance of TRLs can result in substantial reductions in TG levels.

There is consistent evidence for an association of cardiovascular events with blood apoC-III level, with support from human genetic studies of APOC3 variants.

Overall, 12 985 metabolic features were tested for an association with APOC3 genotype. 161 uniquely annotated metabolites were found to be associated with rs138326449(APOC3). The highest proportion of associated metabolites belonged to the acyl-acyl glycerophospholipid and triacylglyceride metabolite classes. In addition to the anticipated (on-target) reduction of metabolites in the triacylglyceride and related classes, carriers of the rare variant exhibited previously unreported increases in levels of a number of metabolites from the acyl-alkyl glycerophospholipid class.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403015": "Although elevated serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is without any doubts accepted as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the role of elevated triglycerides (TGs)-rich lipoproteins as an independent risk factor has until recently been quite controversial. Recent data strongly suggest that elevated TG-rich lipoproteins are an independent risk factor for CVD and that therapeutic targeting of them could possibly provide further benefit in reducing CVD morbidity, events and mortality, apart from LDL-C lowering. Today elevated TGs are treated with lifestyle interventions, and with fibrates which could be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. There are also some new drugs. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and it seems that it can substantially lower elevated TGs levels because ANGPTL3 also regulates TGs metabolism. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator which also decreases TGs, and improves other lipid parameters. It seems that it also has some other possible antiatherogenic effects. Alipogene tiparvovec is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral vector that delivers copies of the LPL gene to muscle tissue which accelerates the clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins thus decreasing extremely high TGs levels. Pradigastat is a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor which substantially reduces extremely high TGs levels and appears to be promising in treatment of the rare familial chylomicronemia syndrome.",

Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia - they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic. Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events, beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others. However, CVD outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have produced inconsistent results, meaning that no convincing evidence is available that lowering triglycerides by any approach can reduce mortality.",

It is being developed for treatment of patients with FCS and refractory hypertriglyceridemia. Data from a variety of clinical trials have been very encouraging, with documentation of excellent triglyceride-lowering efficacy, but there have been concerns about the risk of drug-related thrombocytopenia and bleeding that contributed to the recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to not approve the drug for clinical use.

Higher abundance of disialylated (apoC-III<sub>2</sub>) over monosialylated (apoC-III<sub>1</sub>) glycoforms is associated with lower plasma triglyceride levels. Yet, it remains unclear whether apoC-III glycosylation impacts TRL (triglyceride-rich lipoprotein) clearance and whether apoC-III antisense therapy (volanesorsen) affects distribution of apoC-III glycoforms. Approach and Results: To measure the abundance of human apoC-III glycoforms in plasma over time, human TRLs were injected into wild-type mice and mice lacking hepatic TRL clearance receptors, namely HSPGs (heparan sulfate proteoglycans) or both LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) and LRP1 (LDLR-related protein 1). ApoC-III was more rapidly cleared in the absence of HSPG (t<sub>1/2</sub>=25.4 minutes) than in wild-type animals (t<sub>1/2</sub>=55.1 minutes). In contrast, deficiency of LDLR and LRP1 (t<sub>1/2</sub>=56.1 minutes) did not affect clearance of apoC-III. After injection, a significant increase in the relative abundance of apoC-III<sub>2</sub> was observed in HSPG-deficient mice, whereas the opposite was observed in mice lacking LDLR and LRP1. In patients, abundance of plasma apoC-III glycoforms was assessed after placebo or volanesorsen administration. Volanesorsen treatment correlated with a statistically significant 1.4-fold increase in the relative abundance of apoC-III<sub>2</sub> and a 15% decrease in that of apoC-III<sub>1</sub>. The decrease in relative apoC-III<sub>1</sub> abundance was strongly correlated with decreased plasma triglyceride levels in patients. Our results indicate that HSPGs preferentially clear apoC-III<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, apoC-III<sub>1</sub> is more effectively cleared by LDLR/LRP1. Clinically, the increase in the apoC-III<sub>2</sub>/apoC-III<sub>1</sub> ratio on antisense lowering of apoC-III might reflect faster clearance of apoC-III<sub>1</sub> because this metabolic shift associates with improved triglyceride levels.",

Secondary outcomes included an IGA score indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the IGA score for the intertriginous area and the change in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease). Safety was also assessed. Among 331 patients who underwent randomization, 109 were assigned to roflumilast 0.3% cream, 113 to roflumilast 0.15% cream, and 109 to vehicle cream. An IGA score indicating clear or almost clear at week 6 was observed in 28% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, in 23% in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and in 8% in the vehicle group (P&lt;0.001 and P = 0.004 vs. vehicle for roflumilast 0.3% and 0.15%, respectively). Among the approximately 15% of patients overall who had baseline intertriginous psoriasis of at least mild severity, an IGA score at week 6 indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the intertriginous-area IGA score occurred in 73% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 44% of those in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 29% of those in the vehicle group. The mean baseline PASI scores were 7.7 in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 8.0 in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 7.6 in the vehicle group; the mean change from baseline at week 6 was -50.0%, -49.0%, and -17.8%, respectively. Application-site reactions occurred with similar frequency in the roflumilast groups and the vehicle group. Roflumilast cream administered once daily to affected areas of psoriasis was superior to vehicle cream in leading to a state of clear or almost clear at 6 weeks.

Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.5% and 0.15% in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: This phase 1/2a study enrolled a single-dose, open-label cohort (Cohort 1: 0.5% cream applied to 25 cm\u00b2 psoriatic plaques), and a 28-day, double-blinded cohort (Cohort 2: 1:1:1 randomization to roflumilast cream 0.5%, 0.15%, or vehicle). Patients had chronic plaque psoriasis of &gt;6 months' duration with \u22645% body surface area involvement. Outcomes included safety (adverse events) and efficacy (percentage change in the Target Plaque Severity Score [TPSS] \u00d7 Target Plaque Area [TPA]) at week 4. Results: For Cohorts 1 (n=8) and 2 (n=89), adverse events (all mild/moderate; none severe or serious) were similar between active arms and vehicle. Treatment-related events were confined to the application site, without differences between drug and vehicle. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The primary efficacy endpoint was met for both roflumilast cream doses: TPSS\u00d7TPA improvement at week 4 was statistically significant for roflumilast 0.5% (P=0.0007) and 0.15% (P=0.0011) versus vehicle; significance was reached as early as 2 weeks. For both roflumilast cream doses, 66%-67% improvement from baseline was observed at week 4, without reaching a plateau, versus 38% improvement for vehicle. Conclusion: Roflumilast cream was safe and highly effective at doses of 0.5% and 0.15% and represents a potential novel once-daily topical therapy for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.

The porphyrias are a group of disorders in which enzymatic deficiencies in heme production lead to toxic accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which are involved in the neurovisceral attacks. Givosiran acts as a conventional siRNA to trigger RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing on delta-ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), thus returning ALA and PBG metabolites to the physiological level to attenuate further neurotoxicity. Givosiran makes use of a new hepatic-delivery system that conjugates three GalNac (N-acetylgalactosamine) molecules to the siRNA passenger strand. GalNac binds to the liver asialoglycoprotein receptor, favoring the internalization of these GalNac-conjugated siRNAs into the hepatic cells. In a phase I study, subcutaneous monthly administration of givosiran 2.5 mg/kg reduced &gt; 90% of ALA and PBG content. This siRNA is being analyzed in ENVISION (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03338816\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT03338816</a>), a phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. In preliminary results, givosiran achieved clinical endpoints for AIP, reducing urinary ALA levels, and presented a safety profile that enabled further drug development. The clinical performance of givosiran revealed that suppression of ALAS1 by GalNac-decorated siRNAs represents an additional approach for the treatment of patients with AIP that manifests recurrent acute neurovisceral attacks.",

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned symptomatic patients with acute hepatic porphyria to receive either subcutaneous givosiran (2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo monthly for 6 months. The primary end point was the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most common subtype of acute hepatic porphyria. (Composite porphyria attacks resulted in hospitalization, an urgent health care visit, or intravenous administration of hemin at home.) Key secondary end points were levels of ALA and porphobilinogen and the annualized attack rate among patients with acute hepatic porphyria, along with hemin use and daily worst pain scores in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. A total of 94 patients underwent randomization (48 in the givosiran group and 46 in the placebo group). Among the 89 patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the mean annualized attack rate was 3.2 in the givosiran group and 12.5 in the placebo group, representing a 74% lower rate in the givosiran group (P&lt;0.001); the results were similar among the 94 patients with acute hepatic porphyria. Among the patients with acute intermittent porphyria, givosiran led to lower levels of urinary ALA and porphobilinogen, fewer days of hemin use, and better daily scores for pain than placebo. Key adverse events that were observed more frequently in the givosiran group were elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, changes in serum creatinine levels and the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and injection-site reactions. Among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, those who received givosiran had a significantly lower rate of porphyria attacks and better results for multiple other disease manifestations than those who received placebo.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929000": "RNA-based therapies, including RNA molecules as drugs and RNA-targeted small molecules, offer unique opportunities to expand the range of therapeutic targets. Various forms of RNAs may be used to selectively act on proteins, transcripts, and genes that cannot be targeted by conventional small molecules or proteins. Although development of RNA drugs faces unparalleled challenges, many strategies have been developed to improve RNA metabolic stability and intracellular delivery. A number of RNA drugs have been approved for medical use, including aptamers (e.g., pegaptanib) that mechanistically act on protein target and small interfering RNAs (e.g., patisiran and givosiran) and antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., inotersen and golodirsen) that directly interfere with RNA targets. Furthermore, guide RNAs are essential components of novel gene editing modalities, and mRNA therapeutics are under development for protein replacement therapy or vaccination, including those against unprecedented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, functional RNAs or RNA motifs are highly structured to form binding pockets or clefts that are accessible by small molecules. Many natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, oxazolidinones, and phenicols) can directly bind to ribosomal RNAs to achieve the inhibition of bacterial infections. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing RNA-targeted small-molecule drugs amenable to oral administration, and some (e.g., risdiplam and branaplam) have entered clinical trials.

In part A of the trial, patients without recent porphyria attacks (i.e., no attacks in the 6 months before baseline) were randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of one of five ascending doses of givosiran (0.035, 0.10, 0.35, 1.0, or 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. In part B, patients without recent attacks were randomly assigned to receive once-monthly injections of one of two doses of givosiran (0.35 or 1.0 mg per kilogram) or placebo (total of two injections 28 days apart). In part C, patients who had recurrent attacks were randomly assigned to receive injections of one of two doses of givosiran (2.5 or 5.0 mg per kilogram) or placebo once monthly (total of four injections) or once quarterly (total of two injections) during a 12-week period, starting on day 0.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding hydroxymethylbilane synthase, can lead to hepatocyte overaccumulation and systemic distribution of the proximal porphyrin precursors, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). ALA and PBG are toxic to neurons and extrahepatic tissue and cause the neurovisceral clinical manifestations of AIP. Management of AIP includes awareness and avoidance of triggering factors, infusions of hemin for severe acute attacks, and, if indicated for chronic suppressive therapy, maintenance treatment with hemin or givosiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that antagonizes ALA synthase 1 transcripts. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is most commonly caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the gene encoding ferrochelatase (FECH), the heme pathway terminal enzyme. FECH deficiency leads to erythrocyte overaccumulation and high plasma levels of lipophilic protoporphyrins that photoactivate in the skin, causing burning pain and erythema. Protoporphyrins excreted in the bile can cause gallstones, cholestasis, fibrosis, and ultimately liver failure. Management of EPP includes skin protection and afamelanotide, an \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone analog that increases melanin pigment and reduces photoactivation. Liver transplantation may be necessary for severe EPP-induced liver complications.

Anemia and nausea were the main toxic effects in patients who received olaparib. In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone.

Current treatment options for metastatic castration-recurrent prostate cancer (mCRPC) are associated with toxicity and a limited durable response; therefore, additional lines of efficacious and minimally toxic therapy are needed. Olaparib, a poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, received a U.S. Food and Drug Administration breakthrough therapy designation in January 2016 for the treatment of patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM gene-mutated mCRPC based on results of a compelling phase II trial of olaparib in patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (TOPARP-A). This study found that men with mCRPC and genetic mutations in DNA damage repair genes had an overall response rate of nearly 90% with olaparib treatment. In this review, we describe current therapies for mCRPC, the rationale for anti-PARP therapies, the pharmacology of olaparib for prostate cancer, clinical trials of olaparib for mCRPC, our clinical experience with olaparib for prostate cancer at a comprehensive cancer center, and future directions of olaparib for the treatment of mCRPC. Olaparib may constitute a promising treatment to prolong survival in patients with mCRPC, with an acceptable adverse effect profile.

Durvalumab is a human IgG1-K monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death ligand 1 and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer and locally advanced, unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer. Olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has demonstrated an improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) in select patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Data from other trials suggest there may be improved activity in men with DNA damage repair (DDR) mutations treated with checkpoint inhibitors. This trial evaluated durvalumab and olaparib in patients with mCRPC with and without somatic or germline DDR mutations. Eligible patients had received prior enzalutamide and/or abiraterone. Patients received durvalumab 1500 mg i.v. every 28 days and olaparib 300 mg tablets p.o. every 12 h until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients had biopsies of metastatic lesions with an evaluation for both germline and somatic mutations. Seventeen patients received durvalumab and olaparib. Nausea was the only nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurring in &gt; 1 patient (2/17). No patients were taken off trial for toxicity. Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) for all patients is 16.1 months (95% CI: 4.5-16.1 months) with a 12-month rPFS of 51.5% (95% CI: 25.7-72.3%).

We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaparib plus the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer regardless of HRR mutation status. We carried out this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 41 urological oncology sites in 11 countries across Europe and North America. Eligible male patients were aged 18 years or older with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously received docetaxel and were candidates for abiraterone treatment. Patients were excluded if they had received more than two previous lines of chemotherapy, or had previous exposure to second-generation antihormonal drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice or web response system, without stratification, to receive oral olaparib 300 mg twice daily or placebo. All patients received oral abiraterone 1000 mg once daily and prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation.

Exploiting DNA damage repair defects via inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is becoming an attractive therapeutic option. The TOPARP-A clinical trial demonstrated that the PARP inhibitor olaparib may be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer. However, several unanswered questions regarding the use of olaparib remain: 1) How do we best stratify patients for olaparib treatment? 2) Where do we place olaparib in the treatment sequence paradigm? 3) Is there cross-resistance between olaparib and currently used therapies? Here, we tested putative cross-resistance between current therapies and olaparib in treatment-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer models. Docetaxel-resistant cells exhibited robust resistance to olaparib which could be attributed to blunted PARP trapping in response to olaparib treatment. Upregulated ABCB1 mediates cross-resistance between taxanes and olaparib, which can be overcome through decreasing ABCB1 expression or inhibiting ABCB1 using elacridar or enzalutamide. We also show that combining olaparib with enzalutamide is more effective in olaparib-sensitive cells than either single agent.

To discuss the emerging role that PARP inhibitors may play as a personalised future treatment option in patients with prostate cancer, with a focus on patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) whose tumour cells harbour mutations resulting from deficient homologous recombination repair (HRR). To identify publications relevant to this review, a systematic literature search of PubMed was conducted for articles and proceedings of relevant major congresses, published between January 2010 and March 2020, reporting the use of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of cancers. A total of 168 publications were identified, and 18 of these met the criteria for subsequent review. In addition, 15 phase 2 or on-going phase 3 (mCRPC) studies evaluating PARP inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination, which had not yet reported data, were identified through ClinicalTrials.gov. Emerging data suggest that the greatest efficacy with single-agent PARP inhibitors is seen in mCRPC patients with germline or somatic BRCA1/2 alterations (especially BRCA2 or biallelic mutations), with potential efficacy also observed in men with PALB2 and FANCA mutations. PARP inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in mCRPC, and similar to ovarian and breast cancers, the greatest effect is observed in patients with HRR deficiency. The PARP inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib are now FDA approved for mCRPC patients with HRR mutations and BRCA1/2 mutations, respectively. Furthermore, when PARP inhibition is combined with novel hormonal therapies, a treatment benefit may be observed regardless of the HRR deficiency status. Gaps in the knowledge and understanding around PARP inhibitor use in prostate cancer, including the most appropriate diagnostic testing method for identifying an HRR mutation, remain to be resolved. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib are now approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

The results of the final analysis of overall survival have not yet been reported. In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive olaparib (256 patients) or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy (131 patients). Cohort A included 245 patients with at least one alteration in <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, or <i>ATM</i>, and cohort B included 142 patients with at least one alteration in any of the other 12 prespecified genes.

Overall survival in cohort A, a key secondary end point, was analyzed with the use of an alpha-controlled, stratified log-rank test at a data maturity of approximately 60%.

Using 2D and 3D cell culture models mimicking the different treatment and progression stages of PCa, we evaluated a potential use for olaparib in combination with first-line endocrine treatments, androgen deprivation, and complete androgen blockade, and as a maintenance therapy following on from endocrine therapy. We demonstrate that the LNCaP cell line, possessing multiple aberrations in BRCAness genes, is sensitive to olaparib. Additive effects of olaparib combined with endocrine treatments in LNCaP are noted. In contrast, we find that the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive cell lines VCaP and DuCaP do not show signs of synthetic lethality, but are sensitive to cytotoxic effects caused by olaparib. In consequence, additive effects of olaparib with endocrine therapy were not observable in these cell lines, showing the need for synthetic lethality in combination treatment regimens. Additionally, we show that PCa cells remain sensitive to olaparib treatment after initial androgen deprivation implicating a possible use of olaparib as maintenance therapy.

Neuromuscular disorders, as laryngeal spasm, are recognized complications of hypomagnesemia, but until now only 1 case of motor esophageal disorder associated with a low Mg plasma level was briefly reported in the literature, even if dysphagia is generally included in the symptomatological pattern of hypomagnesemia. Our observation of a severe form of esophageal spasm, associated with hypomagnesemia, in an aged female patient underlines the pathophysiological meaning of the plasma Mg level and suggests the need for routine Mg determination in the clinical setting.",

Corkscrew oesophagus is a radiological diagnosis and is characterised by twisted segments in the distal third of the oesophagus. The condition can sometimes be demonstrated endoscopically and it is due to a basic disturbance in the motility of the oesophagus. Painful conditions in the oesophagus are most frequently caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux or disturbances in motility and the latter is frequently complicated by reflux oesophagitis. Pain of oesophageal origin is frequently a diagnosis by exclusion and requires exclusion of ischaemic heart disease. The initial treatment should be directed to the reflux oesophagitis. The diagnosis and information about the origin of the pain and the benign course of the condition will calm the majority of the patients and remove their fear of a possible fatal heart disease.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1992626": "Nonpropulsive esophageal contractions radiologically described as tertiary contractions or \"corkscrew\" esophagus suggest the presence of an underlying motility disorder and may lead to impaired acid clearance. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence and role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in patients with tertiary contractions. Thirty-five consecutive patients with spontaneous, repetitive, nonpropulsive esophageal contractions noted on esophagography were studied with endoscopy, infusion esophageal manometry, and 24-h ambulatory pH monitoring. All patients had esophageal symptoms, mainly dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain, but only three were found to have esophagitis by endoscopy and biopsy. Nineteen patients had repetitive, nonlumen-obliterating, nonperistaltic (tertiary) contractions, six had corkscrew esophagus, and 10 had forceful, lumen-obliterating simultaneous contractions (rosary bead esophagus). Twenty patients (58%) had GER by pH criteria with mean values: % time pH less than 4, 40.9; %upright pH less than 4, 41; %supine pH less than 4, 44.3%; number of episodes with greater than 5 min of pH less than 4, 12. Esophageal motility revealed \"nutcracker\" esophagus in eight, low LESP in two, and nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 10. Symptoms or severity of nonperistaltic contractions did not correlate with GER. Radiologically demonstrable free reflux or the presence of heartburn did not predict GER. We conclude that 1) GER occurs in up to 58% of patients with nonpropulsive (tertiary) esophageal contractions on esophagography, and may play a role in the induction of abnormal peristaltic activity of the esophageal body; 2) GER is usually not associated with endoscopic evidence of esophagitis or characteristic symptoms, and is recognized by 24-h pH monitoring. We speculate that detection and treatment of GER may improve the symptomatic management of patients with nonpropulsive esophageal contractions.",

Barium swallow examination revealed the esophagus to have the corkscrew appearance characteristic of diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). This diagnosis was confirmed by esophageal manometry, which revealed intermittent, simultaneous, high-amplitude (30-100 mmHg) contractions after 65% of wet swallows. The muscle layer was also found to be thickened throughout the spastic region. Long esophagomyotomy with fundoplication was performed after treatment with medication proved ineffective. Myotomy proceeded superiorly to the area under aortic arch and inferiorly 3 cm into the cardiac portion. Fluoroscopy of the esophagus after the operation showed the spastic changes to be absent, and the patient showed improved clinical signs. We therefore recommend long myotomy of the esophageal wall with antireflux surgery for DES with sever dysphagia that is resistant to conservative treatment.",

An international task force considered new evidence supporting or contradicting previous recommendations and novel therapies and strategic insights based on two systematic literature searches on efficacy and safety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) since the last update (2016) until 2019. A predefined voting process was applied, current levels of evidence and strengths of recommendation were assigned and participants ultimately voted independently on their level of agreement with each of the items. The task force agreed on 5 overarching principles and 12 recommendations concerning use of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GCs); biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, sarilumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib). Guidance on monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and tapering on sustained clinical remission is provided. Cost and sequencing of b/tsDMARDs are addressed. Initially, MTX plus GCs and upon insufficient response to this therapy within 3 to 6 months, stratification according to risk factors is recommended. With poor prognostic factors (presence of autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions or failure of two csDMARDs), any bDMARD or JAK inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, any other bDMARD (from another or the same class) or tsDMARD is recommended. On sustained remission, DMARDs may be tapered, but not be stopped. Levels of evidence and levels of agreement were mostly high. These updated EULAR recommendations provide consensus on the management of RA with respect to benefit, safety, preferences and cost.",

Their use has resulted in a marked improvement of disease control and a limitation of joint damage, although some patients still require subsequent corrective or joint replacement surgery. Due to their immunosuppressive effects, some DMARDs are associated with an increased risk of infection. The aim of this review is to discuss the available literature on the management of DMARDs during the perioperative period, particularly in the case of orthopaedic surgery. Conventional synthetic DMARDs such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine appear to be safe during the perioperative period.

We propose to divide the latter into biological original and biosimilar DMARDs (boDMARDs and bsDMARDs, respectively, such as abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab or tocilizumab, but also emerging ones like clazakizumab, ixekizumab, sarilumab, secukinumab or sirukumab) and the former into conventional synthetic and targeted synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs and tsDMARDs, respectively). tsDMARDs would then constitute only those that were specifically developed to target a particular molecular structure (such as tofacitinib, fostamatinib, baricitinib or apremilast, or agents not focused primarily on rheumatic diseases, such as imatinib or ibrutinib), while csDMARDs would comprise the traditional drugs (such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, gold salts and others).

This double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized 834 participants to treat one migraine attack with ubrogepant 1 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The co-primary endpoints were pain freedom and headache response at two hours. The first primary hypothesis tested the dose-response trend for two-hour pain freedom using a logistic regression model. Subsequent hypotheses tested the effects of each dose on the co-primary endpoints, using a closed sequential testing procedure to control for multiplicity. A total of 527 participants received ubrogepant and 113 received placebo. A positive response trend in the proportion of participants achieving two-hour pain freedom was demonstrated (p &lt; 0.001). Ubrogepant 100 mg was significantly superior to placebo for two-hour pain freedom (25.5% vs 8.9%) but not for two-hour headache response. Per the prespecified multiplicity strategy, this nonsignificant result precluded further formal hypothesis testing, although the 50 mg and 25 mg doses demonstrated nominal significance over placebo for two-hour pain freedom (unadjusted p &lt; 0.05). Overall, adverse events were similar between ubrogepant and placebo.

Regimens including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as continuous infusion are commonly used in the preoperative setting, especially for large tumours and locally advanced disease. We therefore evaluated the role of PeCT with 5-FU as continuous infusion after preoperative chemotherapy (PreCT), covering the surgical phase and acute wound healing period, in patients with breast cancer too large to attempt breast-conserving surgery upon diagnosis. Breast cancer patients, clinical stages T2-T3, N0-N2, M0, and Ki-67 labelling index &gt;/= 20%, were treated every 3 weeks with a maximum of six courses of vinorelbine 20 mg total dose intravenously (i.v.) on days 1 and 3, cisplatin 60 mg/ m(2) i.v. on day 1 and 5-FU 200 mg/m(2)/day as a continuous infusion (ViFuP regimen). Patients who achieved a clinical and radiological objective remission with PreCT were also treated with perioperative 5-FU that was continued until 30 min before, and restarted immediately after surgery, prolonging infusion until 15 days after surgery. Following preoperative treatment, 39 of 49 evaluable patients [80%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 70% to 90%] had an objective response. Pathological complete remission (pCR) was achieved in 14 (29%) patients. No relevant clinical or haematological toxicity due to PeCT was observed. In 36 patients submitted to PeCT the rate of pCR was 33% (95% CI 18% to 48%). The highest response of the primary tumour to PreCT and PeCT was observed in women with tumours not expressing estrogen and progesterone receptors (pCR 46%; 95% CI 19% to 73%). Preoperative therapy can be protracted into the surgical (and wound healing) period without significant additional short-term toxicity.

Planned bidRT was completed in 25 patients and all but one received planned bidRT dose without interruptions. Radiotherapy was well tolerated, mucositis was the most common side effect (grade 3-12 patients, grade 4-1 patient).

Good patient compliance did not compromise the delivery of planned dose of bidRT. However, short median duration of response (14.6 months) and moderate median overall survival (18.7 months) indicate the need for more intensive therapeutic strategies.

In order to evaluate the role of CYLD in intestinal epithelial carcinogenesis, mice (IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice) that carry a mutation that eliminates the deubiquitinating domain of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were generated by crossing Villin-Cre transgenic mice to previously generated mice carrying a loxP-flanked Cyld exon 9 (Cyld (flx9) mice). We found that IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice did not present spontaneous intestinal abnormalities up to one year of age. However, upon challenge with a combination of genotoxic (AOM) and pro-inflammatory (DSS) agents we found that the number of adenomas in the IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice was dramatically increased compared to the control mice. Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect the classical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) activation pathways under physiological conditions, suggesting that these pathways do not predispose CYLD-deficient intestinal epithelia to colorectal cancer development before the onset of genotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory stress. Our findings underscore a critical tumor-suppressing role for functional intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated carcinogenesis. CYLD expression and its associated pathways in intestinal tumors may be exploited for future prognostic and therapeutic purposes.",

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al. (2015) and 11 patients with both CNS and metabolic abnormalities. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20<sup>th</sup> percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20<sup>th</sup> percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization. The results of this study indicate that network-based analysis of UM data can provide an additional mode of evidence to prioritize causal genes in patients with suspected IEMs.",

TS protein expression was determined in mCRC tissue. Patients who had TS-L tumors received FOLFOX/Bev, and those who had TS-H tumors were randomly assigned to receive either FOLFOX/Bev or IROX/Bev. The primary endpoint was the response rate (complete plus partial responses). In total, 211 of 247 patients (70% TS-H) were registered to the treatment phase. Efficacy analyses included eligible patients who had started treatment (N = 186). The response rates for patients who received IROX/Bev (TS-H), FOLFOX/Bev (TS-H), and FOLFOX/Bev (TS-L) were 33%, 38%, and 49%, respectively (P = nonsignificant). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9-12 months; 10 months in the IROX/Bev TS-H group, 9 months in the FOLFOX/Bev TS-H group, and 13 months in the FOLFOX/Bev TS-L group). The TS-L group had improved PFS compared with the TS-H group that received FOLFOX/Bev (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0%-2.4%; P = .04; Cox regression). The median overall survival (OS) was 22 months (95% CI, 20 29 months; 18 months in the IROX/Bev TS-H group, 21 months in the FOLFOX/Bev TS-H group, and 32 months in the TS-L group). OS comparisons for the 2 TS-H arms and for the FOLFOX/Bev TS-H versus TS-L arms were not significantly different. TS expression was prognostic: Patients with TS-L tumors who received FOLFOX/Bev had a longer PFS than those with TS-H tumors, along with a trend toward longer OS.

Electronic searches were performed in the Cochrane Library, PubMed and Embase databases from inception to June 2017. Network meta-analysis combined direct and indirect evidence to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) of different chemotherapy regimens for advanced CRC. Fourteen randomized controlled trails (RCTs) covering 4,383 patients with advanced CRC were included. The results revealed that FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, IROX, and TOMOX all showed higher overall response rates (ORRs) than FF or raltitrexed. Compared with raltitrexed, the aforementioned four regimens also had higher 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates. In addition, FOLFOX and FOLFIRI exhibited higher disease control rates (DCRs) and 1-year PFS rates than FF or raltitrexed. Cluster analysis revealed that FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and TOMOX had better short-term and long-term efficacies. These findings suggest FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and TOMOX are superior to other regimens for advanced CRC. These three regimens are therefore recommended for clinical treatment of advanced CRC.",

End points included log ratio of tumor size at 6, 12, and 18 weeks relative to baseline; time to tumor growth (TTG), estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model; and PFS. Arms were compared using rank sum tests for log ratio and TTG and a log-rank test for PFS. For FOLFOX versus IFL, TTG and PFS had similar power, with both exceeding the power of log ratio at 18 weeks; for FOLFOX versus IROX, TTG and log ratio at 18 weeks had similar power, with both exceeding the power of PFS. The best end points exhibited &gt; 80% power with 60 to 80 patients per arm. TTG is a powerful end point for randomized phase II trials of cytotoxic therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer; it was either comparable or superior to PFS and log ratio at 18 weeks.

Pharmacogenetics identifies the likelihood of adverse events or response based on variants in genes involved in drug transport, metabolism, and cellular targets. Germline DNA was extracted from 520 patients on the North American Gastrointestinal Intergroup N9741 study. Three study arms were evaluated: IFL (fluorouracil [FU] + irinotecan [IRN]), FOLFOX (FU + oxaliplatin), and IROX (IRN + oxaliplatin). Information on adverse events, response, and disease-free survival was available. Thirty-four variants in 15 candidate genes for analysis based on previous associations with adverse events or outcome were assessed. Genotyping was performed using pyrosequencing. All variants were polymorphic. The homozygous UGT1A1*28 allele observed in 9% of patients was associated with risk of grade 4 neutropenia in patients on IROX (55% v 15%; P = .002). Deletion in GSTM1 was associated with grade 4 neutropenia after FOLFOX (28% v 16%; P = .02). Patients with a homozygous variant genotype for GSTP1 were more likely to discontinue FOLFOX because of neurotoxicity (24% v 10%; P = .01). The presence of a CYP3A5 variant was significantly associated with RR on IFL (29% v 60%; P = .0074). Most previously published genotype-toxicity or -efficacy relationships were not validated in this study. This study provides a platform to evaluate pharmacogenetic predictors of response or severe adverse events in advanced CRC.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19822515": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antimetabolite that acts during the S phase of the cell cycle. The active metabolite, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), thus preventing DNA synthesis, which leads to imbalanced cell growth and ultimately cell death. 5-FU and its oral prodrug capecitabine are used in the treatment of a number of solid tumors, including colorectal, breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and bladder cancers. Common side effects include leukopenia, diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, and alopecia. Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a relatively common side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is more frequently associated with 5-FU, capecitabine, and cytarabine. This article reports on the case of a 55-year-old black man with metastatic colorectal carcinoma that was refractory to recommended treatment measures who developed grade 3 HFS after treatment with modified FOLFOX6 (leucovorin [LV]/5-FU/oxaliplatin) and bFOL (bolus 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin) regimens. Treatment was discontinued despite excellent response to chemotherapy. The patient had progression of disease on IROX (irinotecan/oxaliplatin) and irinotecan/cetuximab regimens. He was started on gemcitabine/capecitabine and developed HFS again, which was controlled with aggressive skin care and vitamin B6 treatment. Full sequencing of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) gene and analysis of the human TS gene (TYMS) promoter region was performed. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed 2R/2R genotype of TYMS gene, which is associated with up to a 2.5-fold risk of toxicity to 5-FU therapy. Hand-foot syndrome has proven to be a dose-limiting toxicity of 5-FU, especially of capecitabine, leading to significant morbidity. Hand-foot syndrome seems to be dose dependent, and both peak drug concentration and total cumulative dose determine its occurrence. Genetic variations such as polymorphic abnormality of TYMS are potential causative factors for a significant portion of serious adverse reactions to 5-FU-based therapy.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients with metastatic or recurrent CRC that had progressed or recurred during or after adjuvant or first-line fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil/leucovorin or capecitabine, the latter only for metastatic CRC). Patients received IROX (irinotecan 200 mg/m(2) plus oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or irinotecan alone (350 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks. At the data cutoff (when 447 of 628 randomly assigned patients had died), median overall survival was 13.4 months (95% CI, 12.4 to 14.7 months) and 11.1 month (95% CI, 10.0 to 12.7 months) in the IROX and irinotecan groups, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.94; P = .0072). Overall response rate (22% v 7%, respectively; P &lt; .0001), median time to progression (5.3 v 2.8 months, respectively; P &lt; .0001), and improvement in tumor-related symptoms (32% v 19%, respectively; P = .0072) were also improved with IROX as compared with irinotecan. With the exception of granulocytopenia (25% v 13%), diarrhea (28% v 23%), and sensory disturbances (5% v 0%), grade 3 to 4 toxicities were comparable between the IROX and irinotecan groups, respectively. CONCLUSION IROX is an effective treatment for metastatic CRC that has progressed after first-line fluoropyrimidine therapy. IROX improves efficacy compared with irinotecan alone, providing an additional option in the postadjuvant or second-line treatment setting for patients who experience treatment failure with single-agent fluoropyrimidine therapy.",

This IROX regimen was oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) and irinotecan 200 mg/m(2) administered every 3 weeks. The relation between adverse events on IROX to selected characteristics was analyzed. Time to progression (TTP), response rate, and overall survival for patients treated with IROX compared with patients treated with oxaliplatin with 5- fluorouracil (FOLFOX) were updated in this article. Grade &gt;or=3 gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities were common with 39% patients experiencing neutropenia, 28% diarrhea, and 21% vomiting. Patients ages &gt;70 years experienced higher rates of grade &gt;or=3 toxicity, with significantly higher rates of grade &gt;or=3 hematologic toxicities (P = .02). Long-term toxicity was uncommon, and nearly all cases of grade &gt;or=3 neurotoxicity resolved within 10 months. Fifty-two percent of patients required dose reductions for adverse events, and 26% experienced 119 hospitalizations related to complications of treatment or their disease, with 5 treatment-related deaths. This analysis confirmed prior findings that FOLFOX is superior to IROX in terms of response rate (43% vs 36%, p = 0.002), TTP (9.2 months vs 6.7 months, P &lt; .0001), and overall survival (19.5 months vs 17.3 months, P = .0001). IROX was found to be less active than FOLFOX but with a similar toxicity profile except in patients ages &gt;70 years. Although IROX may be considered in patients intolerant of 5-FU or in patients known to have a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, it should be used with caution in older patients.",

A total of 1,691 patients were randomly assigned to one of seven fluorouracil-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing regimens. OS and TTP were calculated by treatment arm and baseline risk group (on the basis of WBC, performance status, number of sites of disease, and alkaline phosphatase). Multivariate prognostic factor analysis was used to assess clinical factors for their relationships to OS, TTP, response, and toxicity by using Cox and logistic regression models. The observed 5-year survival with infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) of 9.8% was better than with irinotecan plus bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin (IFL; 3.7%; P = .04) or with bolus irinotecan/oxaliplatin (IROX; 5.1%; P = .128).

Pharmacological targeting of FGFRs may therefore provide therapeutic benefit to selected cancer patients, and proof-of-concept has been established in early clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular structure and preclinical characterization of INCB054828 (pemigatinib), a novel, selective inhibitor of FGFR 1, 2, and 3, currently in phase 2 clinical trials. INCB054828 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated using cell lines and tumor models, and the antitumor effect of oral INCB054828 was investigated using xenograft tumor models with genetic alterations in FGFR1, 2, or 3. Enzymatic assays with recombinant human FGFR kinases showed potent inhibition of FGFR1, 2, and 3 by INCB054828 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 nM, respectively) with weaker activity against FGFR4 (IC50 30 nM). INCB054828 selectively inhibited growth of tumor cell lines with activation of FGFR signaling compared with cell lines lacking FGFR aberrations. The preclinical pharmacokinetic profile suggests target inhibition is achievable by INCB054828 in vivo with low oral doses. INCB054828 suppressed the growth of xenografted tumor models with FGFR1, 2, or 3 alterations as monotherapy, and the combination of INCB054828 with cisplatin provided significant benefit over either single agent, with an acceptable tolerability. The preclinical data presented for INCB054828, together with preliminary clinical observations, support continued investigation in patients with FGFR alterations, such as fusions and activating mutations.",

Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, is the only targeted agent approved for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced EGJ or GC in combination with chemotherapy. However, patients invariably become resistant during this treatment. We recently identified the overexpression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 3 (FGFR3) as a molecular mechanism responsible for trastuzumab resistance in GC models, providing the rationale for the inhibition of this receptor as a potential second-line strategy in this disease. Pemigatinib is a selective, potent, oral inhibitor of FGFR1, 2, and 3. The FiGhTeR trial is a phase II, single-arm, open-label study to assess safety and activity of the FGFR inhibitor pemigatinib as second-line treatment strategy in metastatic EGJ/GC patients progressing under trastuzumab-containing therapies. The primary endpoint is the 12-week progression-free survival rate. Plasma and tumor tissue samples will be collected for translational research analyses at baseline, during treatment, and at progression on pemigatinib. Co-alterations in genes coding for different tyrosine-kinase receptors are emerging as relevant mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapeutic strategies in GC. In particular, our group has recently identified that in GC models the overexpression of FGFR3 sustains the acquired resistance to trastuzumab. This trial aims to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of the FGFR inhibitor pemigatinib as a second-line treatment in metastatic EGJ/GC patients refractory to first-line trastuzumab-containing therapies. Furthermore, this study offers the opportunity to prospectively study mechanisms and pathways involved in trastuzumab resistance. CRC2017_02. 2017-004522-14.",

The eastern United States represents the most recent expansion of their range, and presents an opportunity to test alternative models of colonization history. Here, we investigate the genetic population structure of this invasive fruit fly, with a focus on the eastern United States. We sequenced six X-linked gene fragments from 246 individuals collected from a total of 12 populations. We examine patterns of genetic diversity within and between populations and explore alternative colonization scenarios using approximate Bayesian computation. Our results indicate high levels of nucleotide diversity in this species and suggest that the recent invasions of Europe and the continental United States are independent demographic events. More broadly speaking, our results highlight the importance of integrating population structure into demographic models, particularly when attempting to reconstruct invasion histories. Finally, our simulation results illustrate the general challenge in reconstructing invasion histories using genetic data and suggest that genome-level data are often required to distinguish among alternative demographic scenarios.",

Accurate identification of promoters is essential for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Since experimental methods are costly and ineffective, developing efficient and accurate computational tools to identify promoters are necessary. Although a series of methods have been proposed for identifying promoters, none of them is able to identify the promoters of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In the present work, a new method called ncPro-ML was proposed to identify the promoter of ncRNA in <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>Mus musculus</i>, in which different kinds of sequence encoding schemes were used to convert DNA sequences into feature vectors. To test the length effect, for each species, datasets including sequences with different lengths were built. The results demonstrated that ncPro-ML achieved the best performance based on the dataset with the sequence length of 221 nucleotides for human and mouse. The performances of ncPro-ML were also satisfying from both independent dataset test and cross-species test. The results indicate that the proposed predictor can server as a powerful tool for the discovery of ncRNA promoters.

Here, we develop population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models aiming to quantify the effect of AZD8601 injections on the dynamics of wound healing. A dataset of 584 open wound area measurements from 131 mice was integrated from 3 independent studies encompassing different doses, dosing timepoints, and number of doses. Evaluation of several candidate models showed that wound healing acceleration is not likely driven directly by time-dependent VEGF-A concentration. Instead, we found that administration of AZD8601 induced a sustained acceleration of wound healing depending on the accumulated dose, with a dose producing 50% of the maximal effect of 92 \u00b5g. Simulations with this model showed that a single dose of 200 \u00b5g AZD8601 can reduce the time to reach 50% wound healing by up to 5 days.",

GluA2 has an especially important role because, following post-transcriptional editing at the Q607 site, it renders heteromultimeric AMPARs Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable, with a linear relationship between current and trans-membrane voltage. Here, we report heterozygous de novo GRIA2 mutations in 28 unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID) and neurodevelopmental abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome-like features, and seizures or developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In functional expression studies, mutations lead to a decrease in agonist-evoked current mediated by mutant subunits compared to wild-type channels. When GluA2 subunits are co-expressed with GluA1, most GRIA2 mutations cause a decreased current amplitude and some also affect voltage rectification. Our results show that de-novo variants in GRIA2 can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, complementing evidence that other genetic causes of ID, ASD and DEE also disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission.",

She also had an apparently balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation 46XX,t(X:5) with the X breakpoint being between q26 and q27. Pedigree analysis, and the normal iduronate sulphatase activity in the mother's fibroblasts, serum, and hair roots indicate that the affected child represents a new mutation. Since the parents' karyotypes are normal, it seems that the translocation disrupted the iduronate sulphatase gene itself, thus mapping this to Xq26-27 for the first time.

Results of further linkage studies using probes defining the loci DXS86, DXS144, DXS100, DXS102, DXS105, F8C, and DXS134 are also consistent with our original conclusion that the Hunter locus lies within the distal region of the X chromosome long arm.",

Normal activities were measured in samples from the father and younger sister but a partial deficiency (43% of control serum) was found in the mother. Chromosome studies on the patient revealed a partial deletion of the long arm of one X-chromosome, most probably of band Xq25, which was not inherited from either parent.

In a sequence analysis of the iduronate-2-sulfatase gene, evidence was obtained for the R468Q (G1403 to A) mutation, a common one in Hunter disease. RT-PCR showed her cDNA to represent only the R468Q allele, although at the genomic level she was a heterozygote with one normal allele. Her brother had the R468Q mutation, and their mother was a carrier of this mutation. The fusion products of CHO (TG(R),Neo(R)) with patient's fibroblasts cultured in HAT/G418 selective medium, carried only the maternal allele. However, in genomic DNA from the patient's fibroblasts, only the paternal allele of the androgen receptor gene, a gene subjected to differential methylation of the inactive X-chromosome, was methylated. These findings strongly suggest that the severe form of Hunter disease in this girl was the result of selective expression of the maternal allele carrying the missense mutation R468Q, which in turn resulted from skewed X inactivation of the paternal nonmutant X chromosome.",

Gene deletions of the Xq27-28 region are less frequently found in either condition with rare reports in females. Additionally, an association between Xq27-28 deletions and skewed X-inactivation of the normal X chromosome observed in previous studies suggested a primary role of the Xq27-28 region in X-inactivation. We describe the clinical, molecular and biochemical evaluations of a four year-old female patient with global developmental delay and a hemizygous deletion of Xq27.3q28 (144,270,614-154,845,961 bp), a 10.6 Mb region that contains &gt;100 genes including IDS and FMR1.

This is a report of a female with a 10.6 Mb Xq27-28 deletion with skewed inactivation of the deleted X chromosome. Contrary to previous reports, our observations do not support a primary role of the Xq27-28 region in X-inactivation.

Similar studies on DNA from maternal lymphocytes showed random X-chromosome inactivation. Among a total of 40 independent maternal fibroblast clones isolated by dilution plating and analyzed for IDS activity, no IDS- clone was found. Somatic cell hybrid clones containing at least one active human X chromosome were produced by fusion of patient fibroblasts with Hprt- hamster fibroblasts (RJK88) and grown in HAT-ouabain medium.

Thus, the girl confirmed comorbidity - Turner syndrome with a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome X of paternal origin, affecting the Xq28 region (localization of the IDS gene), and Hunter syndrome due to a deletion of the IDS gene inherited from the mother. The structural defect of chromosome X in the girl confirmed the hemizygous state due to the mutation in the IDS gene, which has led to the formation of the clinical phenotype of Hunter syndrome.",

Among eight related females aged under 60 years from three generations who were tested, four revealed a non-random pattern of XCI. Detailed genetic analysis failed to find mutations in genes that were previously reported as important for the XCI process. Haplotype analysis excluded linkage of non-random XCI with genes localized on the X-chromosome.

The general phenotype includes coarse facies, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly, joint stiffness, hernias, dysostosis multiplex, mucopolysaccharides excretion in the urine and metachromatic staining in peripheral leukocytes and bone marrow. Various components of the MPS phenotype are also found in the mucolipidoses, glycoprotein storage diseases. Detailed clinical and radiologic evaluation and identification of the type of MPS excreted in the urine help to narrow the diagnosis possibilities. Definitive diagnosis requires assay of specific enzymes in various tissues such as cultured skin fibroblasts. For the moment there are 14 types of known mucopolysaccharidoses, including several subtypes. They are classified into Hurler's syndrome (MPS I-H); Scheie's syndrome (MPS I-S); Hurler-Scheie's syndrome (MPS I-H/S); Hunter's syndrome A, B (MPS II-A, B); Sanfilippo's syndrome A,B,C,D (MPS II-A,B,C,D); Morquio's syndrome A,B,C (MSP IV-A,B,C); Maroteaux-Lamy's syndrome (MPS VI) and Sly's syndrome MPS VII). The mucopolysaccharidosis incidence is around 0.04-0.3% of the newborn and they are 1.5% of all congenital disorders. All mucopolysaccharidosis are autosomal recessive disorders, except for Hunter's syndrome that is X-linked and recessive. Patient suffering of MPS, usually, don't show clinical sign from their birth in fact they develop later their characteristics.

The receptor is largely expressed and activated in tumor cells and rapidly dividing endothelial cells. The principal ligand for this receptor is l-thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>), usually regarded only as a prohormone for 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), the hormone analogue that expresses thyroid hormone in the cell nucleus via nuclear receptors that are unrelated structurally to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. At the integrin receptor for thyroid hormone, T<sub>4</sub> regulates cancer and endothelial cell division, tumor cell defense pathways (such as anti-apoptosis), and angiogenesis and supports metastasis, radioresistance, and chemoresistance. The molecular mechanisms involve signal transduction via mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, differential expression of multiple genes related to the listed cell processes, and regulation of activities of other cell surface proteins, such as vascular growth factor receptors. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) is derived from T<sub>4</sub> and competes with binding of T<sub>4</sub> to the integrin. In the absence of T<sub>4</sub>, tetrac and chemically modified tetrac also have anticancer effects that culminate in altered gene transcription. Tumor xenografts are arrested by unmodified and chemically modified tetrac. The receptor requires further characterization in terms of contributions to nonmalignant cells, such as platelets and phagocytes. The integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor for thyroid hormone offers a large panel of cellular actions that are relevant to cancer biology and that may be regulated by tetrac derivatives.",

The immunofluorescence results showed that Bmintegrin \u03b21 was located in the cell membrane and widely distributed in fat bodies and different types of hemocytes. Bmintegrin \u03b21 expression was remarkably increased after challenging with different kinds of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

Currently, chemicals and introduced resistance genes are used to protect plants against these pathogens but have limited success and may have adverse environmental impacts. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop alternative strategies to combat bacterial disease in crops. One such strategy involves using narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics (so-called bacteriocins), which diverse bacteria use to compete against closely related species. Here, we demonstrate that one bacteriocin, putidacin L1 (PL1), can be expressed in an active form at high levels in Arabidopsis and in Nicotiana benthamiana in planta to provide effective resistance against diverse pathovars of Ps. Furthermore, we find that Ps strains that mutate to acquire tolerance to PL1 lose their O-antigen, exhibit reduced motility and still cannot induce disease symptoms in PL1-transgenic Arabidopsis. Our results provide proof-of-principle that the transgene-mediated expression of a bacteriocin in planta can provide effective disease resistance to bacterial pathogens. Thus, the expression of bacteriocins in crops might offer an effective strategy for managing bacterial disease, in the same way that the genetic modification of crops to express insecticidal proteins has proven to be an extremely successful strategy for pest management. Crucially, nearly all genera of bacteria, including many plant pathogenic species, produce bacteriocins, providing an extensive source of these antimicrobial agents.",

However, bacteriocins display diverse mechanisms of action, a narrow spectrum of activity, and inherent challenges in natural product isolation making in vitro verification of putative bacteriocins difficult. A subset of bacteriocins exert their antimicrobial effects through favorable biophysical interactions with the bacterial membrane mediated by the charge, hydrophobicity, and conformation of the peptide. We have developed a pipeline for bacteriocin-derived compound design and testing that combines sequence-free prediction of bacteriocins using machine learning and a simple biophysical trait filter to generate 20 amino acid peptides that can be synthesized and evaluated for activity. We generated 28,895 total 20-mer candidate peptides and scored them for charge, \u03b1-helicity, and hydrophobic moment. Of those, we selected 16 sequences for synthesis and evaluated their antimicrobial, cytotoxicity, and hemolytic activities. Peptides with the overall highest scores for our biophysical parameters exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Trio exome sequencing proved the mutations to be de novo in four of the five individuals. Mutations in other SWI/SNF components cause Coffin-Siris syndrome, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, or other syndromic and non-syndromic NDDs. Although the individuals presented here have dysmorphisms and some clinical overlap with these syndromes, they lack their typical facial dysmorphisms. To gain insight into the function of SMARCD1 in neurons, we investigated the Drosophila ortholog Bap60 in postmitotic memory-forming neurons of the adult Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Targeted knockdown of Bap60 in the MB of adult flies causes defects in long-term memory. Mushroom-body-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that Bap60 is required for context-dependent expression of genes involved in neuron function and development in juvenile flies when synaptic connections are actively being formed in response to experience. Taken together, we identify an NDD caused by SMARCD1 mutations and establish a role for the SMARCD1 ortholog Bap60 in the regulation of neurodevelopmental genes during a critical time window of juvenile adult brain development when neuronal circuits that are required for learning and memory are formed.",

No aneurysm or fibrosis was found on postmortem examination. The inflammation was characterized by disruption of the media with patchy transmural chronic and focally acute inflammatory infiltrate. We review case reports of other individuals with aortitis, who initially or very early in their course presented with aortic dissection in the absence of known rheumatic disease and most without evidence of aneurysm formation. We believe that this represents a process characterized by an aggressive vasculitis of the aorta with its own clinical features, a fulminant variety of isolated aortitis.",

It is associated with a wide spectrum of inflammatory diseases of infectious and non-infectious origins, and often present with vague clinical findings and non-specific laboratory results that can model other entities. As a result, aortitis may not form part of the initial workup and appropriate treatment can be delayed or missed. Therefore, imaging modalities are required to assess for inflammation and structural changes in the aorta to support or exclude the diagnosis of aortitis. This review presents current literature on the imaging modalities utilized in the diagnosis and management of aortitis, which surgeons and physicians should be familiar with for providing optimal patient care.",

The clinical presentation of aortitis is nonspecific and variable. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss; acute phase reactants may also be elevated. Aortitis can be caused by a wide spectrum of entities, including from infectious processes to autoimmune diseases (Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis are among the most common of these causing aortitis), and the prognosis and treatment of these entities vary widely. Various imaging techniques can be used to evaluate the lumen and wall of the aorta (such as multidetector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, or PET-CT).

Clinical features are usually nonspecific and a high index of suspicion is required for making the diagnosis. Although noninvasive imaging studies are being increasingly used in evaluating patients for diagnosis, angiography remains the gold standard for confirming aortic involvement. When tissue is available, pathologic examination can aid in clarifying the diagnosis. Aortitis, irrespective of the underlying cause, frequently displays similar clinical, pathologic, and arteriographic features and therefore understandably presents a therapeutic and diagnostic dilemma. Whatever the cause, early identification and aggressive treatment is required in order to avert the potentially life-threatening sequelae. The treatment of aortitis is determined by the underlying cause. If diagnosed early, infectious aortitis responds to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, whereas noninfectious, immune-mediated aortitis requires immunosuppressive therapy. However, in many instances, primarily because of the delay in diagnosis, surgical intervention is necessary to treat the associated anatomic and physiologic sequelae. Less definitive and more controversial is the role of inflammation in both primary and secondary accelerated atherosclerosis of the aorta and its modality of treatment.",

The clinical manifestations are usually vague and nonspecific and may include pain, fever, vascular insufficiency, and elevated levels of acute phase reactants, as well as other systemic manifestations. As a result, aortitis is often overlooked during the initial work-up of patients with constitutional symptoms and systemic disorders. A multimodality imaging approach is often required for assessment of both the aortic wall and aortic lumen, as well as for surveillance of disease activity and treatment planning. Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR angiography, and computed tomographic angiography play a critical role in initial evaluation and further assessment of aortitis.

Because these patients may present with fever of unknown origin, general physicians need to recognise its characteristic laboratory data and clinical features during hospitalisation. to describe the features, symptoms and characteristics of TAFRO syndrome and to compare them to those of idiopathic CD. This was a retrospective study of patients with histopathologically confirmed TAFRO syndrome and idiopathic multicentric CD who were diagnosed and managed between April 2012 and June 2018 in a Japanese university hospital's General Medicine Department.

Patients with TAFRO syndrome were more likely to present with fever, abdominal pain and elevated inflammatory markers and be misdiagnosed with an infectious disease during the first hospital visit. Approximately 40% of patients with TAFRO syndrome had no radiographically enlarged lymph nodes. TAFRO syndrome may present as an infectious disease with an aggressive clinical course.

Renal complication of this disease can be life-threatening and sometimes requires hemodialysis, but it has not been elucidated in detail. Case-series was designed to evaluate the renal histology of patients with TAFRO syndrome treated at our hospital. Seven patients were eligible to the criteria. All of them had severe diuretic-resistant anasarca and 6 of 7 had mild proteinuria (&lt;1 g daily). On light microscopy, all patients showed glomerular endotheliopathy characterized by endothelial cell swelling and a double contour of the glomerular basement membrane with mesangiolysis or mesangial loosening. Immunofluorescent staining and electron microscopy did not detect immune deposits in any patient. Electron microscopy revealed endothelial cell swelling with diffuse expansion of the subendothelial space, loss of mesangial architecture, and loss of endothelial cell fenestrations. Treatment with glucocorticoids and molecular-targeting agents, including tocilizumab and rituximab, improved renal dysfunction and anasarca. In 4 of 7 patients with persistent thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic events occurred despite platelet transfusion or thrombopoietin receptor antagonist therapy. Severe diuretic-resistant anasarca with mild proteinuria and severe glomerular endotheliopathy were common characteristics of renal dysfunction due to TAFRO syndrome. In addition, endothelial changes mediated via interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that lead to vascular hyperpermeability and water leakage might contribute to anasarca, because molecular-targeting therapy directed against IL-6 or VEGF improved renal dysfunction and severe endothelial damage.",

Tapering of immunosuppressive agents resulted in a deterioration of renal function and an elevation of C-reactive protein.

This disease is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, as listed in the title, and multiple lymphadenopathy of mild degree with a pathologic diagnosis of atypical CD, often posing diagnostic and therapeutic problems for pathologists and hematologists, respectively. These findings suggest that this disease represents a novel clinical entity belonging to systemic inflammatory disorders with a background of immunological abnormality beyond the ordinal spectrum of MCD. To define this disorder more clearly, Japanese participants presented clinicopathologic data at the Fukushima and Nagoya meetings. Many of the patients presented by the participants were significantly accompanied by a combination of thrombocytopenia, ascites (anasarca), pleural effusions, microcytic anemia, fever, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (TAFRO). Multiple lymphadenopathies were generally of mild degree, less than 1.5 cm in diameter, and consistently featured the histopathology of mixed- or less hyaline vascular-type CD. Autoantibodies were often detected. However, this disease did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for well-known autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus. Castleman-Kojima disease and TAFRO syndrome (the favored clinical term) were proposed for this disease. The patients were sensitive to steroid and anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab), but some exhibited a deteriorated clinical course despite the treatment. The participants proposed a future nationwide survey and a Japanese consortium to facilitate further clinical and therapeutic studies of this novel disease. [J Clin Exp Hematop 53(1): 57-61, 2013].",

We describe a 21 year old woman with fever, asthenia, bilateral pleural effusion, ascites, hypoalbuminemia, severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal failure and proteinuria, whereas microbiological tests, immune serology (except ANA) and bone marrow biopsy were all negative. A CT-scan showed multiple lymphadenopathy and tissue samplings of mediastinal lymph nodes was compatible with a mixed-type CD. The diagnosis of MCD with TAFRO syndrome was made, but after an initial improvement with high dose corticosteroid therapy, clinical and laboratory features worsened. Based upon the high serum IL-6 levels and the high number of CD20-lymphocytes in lymph nodes tissue, we started tocilizumab (partial benefit), followed by rituximab combined with CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy, achieving a complete response. A total of six cycles of R-CVP were administered monthly, followed by maintenance with monthly rituximab. A complete remission persists at the 12th month of follow-up. In patients with massive immune system activation and lymphadenopathy it is mandatory to rule out Castleman-Kojima disease. In our patient a therapy aimed at the prominent pathophysiological abnormalities has been successful so far. However, since the rarity of TAFRO Syndrome, a multicenter registry is strongly desirable for a better understanding of the disease mechanisms, hopefully leading to evidence-based therapeutic choices.",

A unique clinicopathologic variant of multicentric Castleman's disease, TAFRO (i.e., thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal failure or reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly) syndrome, was recently proposed in Japan. Despite the successful use of anti-interleukin-6 therapy in some patients with TAFRO syndrome, not all patients achieve remission.

Here, we present our experience of a unique case of TAFRO syndrome in a 78-year-old woman whose symptoms responded differently to several therapies. Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, successfully induced remission of fever and lymphadenopathy. However, severe thrombocytopenia persisted and she developed anasarca, ascites, and pleural effusion shortly thereafter. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, and glucocorticoid therapy provided no symptom relief. In contrast, cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressive agent that blocks T cell function by inhibiting interleukin-2, yielded immediate improvements in systemic fluid retention and a gradual increase in platelet count, with complete resolution of disease symptoms. Excessive serum interleukin-2, when used as an anti-cancer agent, has been reported to cause side effects such as fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Our case was unique because the anti-interleukin-2 therapy successfully improved symptoms that were not relieved with anti-interleukin-6 therapy. The present report therefore provides insight into the possible role of interleukin-2, in addition to interleukin-6, in TAFRO syndrome.

Lymph node biopsies revealed atrophic germinal centers with enlarged nuclei of endothelial cells and proliferation of endothelial venules in interfollicular zone. 23 of 25 cases were treated initially with corticosteroids; 12 patients responded poorly and required further therapy. Three patients died during the observation period (median: 9 months) because of disease progression or infections.

Recently, Takai et al. reported a new disease concept, TAFRO syndrome, named from thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly. Furthermore, Kojima et al. reported Japanese MCD cases with effusion and thrombocytopenia (Castleman-Kojima disease). Here, we report two cases of MCD associated with marked pleural effusion, ascites, and thrombocytopenia, and discuss the independence of the TAFRO syndrome (Castleman-Kojima disease). Case 1: A 57-year-old woman had fever, anemia, anasarca, and some small cervical lymphadenopathy. Although she had been administered steroid therapy, and full-coverage antibiotics, her general condition, including fever, systemic inflammation, and anasarca, deteriorated steadily. We administered chemotherapy [CHOEP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisolone) regimen], but despite a transient improvement, she died due to septic shock. Case 2: A 73-year-old man with a history of aplastic anemia and remission presented with fever, severe inflammation, and anasarca. Prednisolone was administered (15 mg daily), and his hyperinflammation once improved. Nevertheless, his general condition, including pleural effusion and ascites, worsened, and C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels showed marked increases. The patient died due to multiorgan failure. Cases of TAFRO syndrome (Castleman-Kojima disease) are still rare. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct multicenter clinical surveys including similar cases, such as ours, to reach a consensus regarding diagnostic criteria, therapeutic strategy, and pathophysiological etiology for this syndrome.",

Patients with iMCD-TAFRO often develop severe abdominal pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and systemic inflammation, but the etiological factors are unknown. To investigate the potential role of bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of iMCD-TAFRO, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene with DNA extracted from liver specimens of three patients with iMCD-TAFRO, four patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and seven patients with inflammatory conditions. Sequencing of the PCR product showed 99% DNA sequence identity with Campylobacter jejuni in all three patients with iMCD-TAFRO and in two patients with inflammatory conditions. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses could not identify C. jejuni in patients with iMCD-TAFRO. The findings indicated that C. jejuni infection is not the pathological cause of iMCD-TAFRO; however, this ubiquitous bacterium may play a role in uncontrolled systemic hypercytokinemia, possibly through the development of cross-reactive autoantibodies.",

Understanding the curli biogenesis mechanism is critical for developing therapeutic agents for biofilm-related infections. Here we report a systematic study of the curli biogenesis system, highlighted by structural, biochemical and functional analysis of the secretion channel complexes (CsgF-CsgG) with and without the curli substrate. The dual-pore architecture of the CsgF-CsgG complex was observed and used to develop an approach to inhibit the curli secretion by physically reducing the size of the CsgF pore. We further elucidated the assembly of the CsgFG complex with curli components (CsgA and CsgB) and curli-cell association through CsgF. Importantly, the recognition of the CsgA substrate by CsgG was uncovered. Nine crevices outside of the CsgG channel provide specific and highly-conserved recognition sites for CsgA N-terminus. Together with analysis of CsgE, our study provides comprehensive insights into curli biogenesis.",

An interesting feature of the disease is that most of PD patients have gastrointestinal problems and bacterial dysbiosis, years before the full expression of motor symptoms. We hypothesized that antibiotic consumption might be a contributing factor of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD, favoring curli-producing Enterobacteria. Curli is a bacterial \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) which is deposited first in the enteric nervous system and amyloid deposits are propagated in a prion like manner to the central nervous system. In addition, antibiotics result in a low-grade systemic inflammation, which also contributes to damage of neurons in enteric- and central nervous system. To support our hypothesis, by comparing PD prevalence change with antibiotic consumption data in EU countries, we found significant positive correlation between use narrow spectrum penicillin + penicillinase resistant penicillin and increased prevalence of the disease.",

While genetic and environmental factors can influence amyloid formation, molecular triggers and/or facilitators are not well defined. Growing evidence suggests that non-identical amyloid proteins may accelerate reciprocal amyloid aggregation in a prion-like fashion. While humans encode ~30 amyloidogenic proteins, the gut microbiome also produces functional amyloids. For example, curli are cell surface amyloid proteins abundantly expressed by certain gut bacteria. In mice overexpressing the human amyloid \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), we reveal that colonization with curli-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> promotes \u03b1Syn pathology in the gut and the brain. Curli expression is required for <i>E. coli</i> to exacerbate \u03b1Syn-induced behavioral deficits, including intestinal and motor impairments. Purified curli subunits accelerate \u03b1Syn aggregation in biochemical assays, while oral treatment of mice with a gut-restricted amyloid inhibitor prevents curli-mediated acceleration of pathology and behavioral abnormalities. We propose that exposure to microbial amyloids in the gastrointestinal tract can accelerate \u03b1Syn aggregation and disease in the gut and the brain.",

IPF is characterized by excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the alveolar parenchyma and progressive lung scarring. The pathogenesis of IPF and whether the ECM involved in the process remain unknown. To identify potential treatment target and ECM associated proteins that may be involved in the development of IPF, we employed isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) combined liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach to examine protein expression in lung tissues from IPF patients. A total of 662 proteins with altered expression (455 upregulated proteins and 207 downregulated proteins) were identified in lung tissue of IPF patients compared with control. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the altered proteins in lung tissue mainly belonged to the PI3K-Akt signaling, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, and carbon metabolism pathways. According to the bioinformatic definition of the matrisome, 229 matrisome proteins were identified in lung tissue. These proteins comprised the ECM of lung, of which 104 were core matrisome proteins, and 125 were matrisome-associated proteins. Of the 229 ECM quantified proteins, 56 significantly differentially expressed proteins (19 upregulated proteins and 37 downregulated proteins) were detected in IPF lung tissue samples. In addition to proteins with well-known functions such as COL1A1, SCGB1A1, TAGLN, PSEN2, TSPAN1, CTSB, AGR2, CSPG2, and SERPINB3, we identified several novel ECM proteins with unknown function deposited in IPF lung tissue including LGALS7, ASPN, HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1. Some of these differentially expressed proteins were further verified using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. This study provides a list of proteomes that were detected in IPF lung tissue by iTRAQ technology combined with LC-MS/MS. The findings of this study will contribute better understanding to the pathogenesis of IPF and facilitate the development of therapeutic targets.",

However, it is not well understood how cells balance production of new matrix molecules and degradation of existing ones during tissue remodelling and regeneration. In this study, we used decellularized lung scaffolds repopulated with allogenic lung fibroblasts cultured with stable isotope labelled amino acids to quantify the balance between matrix production and degradation at a proteome-wide scale. Specific temporal dynamics of different matrisome proteins were found to correspond to the proliferative activity of the repopulating cells and the degree of extracellular deposition. The remodeling of the scaffold was characterized by an initial phase with cell proliferation and high production of cell adhesion proteins such as emilin-1 and fibronectin. Extended culture time resulted in increased levels of core matrisome proteins. In a comparison with monolayer cultures on plastic, culture in lung scaffolds lead to a pronounced accumulation of proteoglycans, such as versican and decorin, resulting in regeneration of an extracellular matrix with greater resemblance to native lung tissue compared to standard monolayer cultures. Collectively, the study presents a promising technique for increasing the understanding of cell- extracellular matrix interactions under healthy and diseased conditions.",

Arthritis was experimentally caused in rats by subcutaneously injecting 0.1 mL of CFA into the subplantar area of the left hind paw under moderate anesthesia on day zero. The regular oral doses of indomethacin/wogonin began on day zero and proceeded after injection to day 35. Wogonin reduced arthritic score considerably, enhanced body weight, and reduced paw thickness. Wogonin also boosted red blood cell considerably along with hemoglobin and reduced white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Wogonin substantially improved an altered level of oxidative stress markers, antioxidant proteins, and inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent way.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of telmisartan administration either alone or in combination with etanercept on anemia of chronic inflammatory diseases in a model of rheumatoid arthritis in rats. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was induced by Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA; 1 mg/0.1 ml paraffin oil), injected subcutaneously on days 0, 30 and 40. Rats with RA received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), etanercept (0.3 mg/kg 3 times/week; sc), telmisartan (1.5 mg/kg/day; orally) or combination of etanercept and telmisartan. Arthritis parameters (footpad circumference change and paw volume change), erythrocyte indices (hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin level changes), iron profile (serum iron and serum ferritin), serum levels of erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated, along with measuring serum urea and creatinine levels. All treated groups showed improvement of the measured parameters in comparison to RA-control subgroup. Telmisartan either alone or in combination with etanercept significantly improved arthritis and erythrocyte indices. Telmisartan showed significant increase in EPO and decrease in hepcidin compared to etanercept. Combination group showed significant improvement in serum iron, ferritin, EPO, hepcidin, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, urea and creatinine, compared to etanercept.

Effectiveness of embelin has been established in a wide variety of inflammatory disorders, but its utility as a therapeutic agent is limited by its poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and fast systemic elimination. To apprehend these limitations, we propose to use highly bioavailable embelin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CS-embelin NPs) for the treatment of RA. The rats were made arthritic using a subcutaneous injection with 0.1 ml complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the footpad of the left hind paw. CS-embelin NPs (25 and 50 mg/kg) was administered from day 15 to day 28 after adjuvant injection. After the experimental period, the animals were sacrificed and various biochemical markers were assessed. Arthritic score and paw swelling were significantly reduced after treatment with CS-embelin NPs. Arthritis-induced rats showed a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) with a concomitant reduction of antioxidants in the paw tissue. CS-embelin NPs (25 and 50 mg/kg) reduced MDA and NO levels and restored antioxidant levels to normalcy by mitigating oxidative stress. The arthritic rats exhibited elevated tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) serum concentrations, upregulated TNF- \u03b1 and IL-6 protein levels and upregulated nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) mRNA expression in paw tissues. Treatment with CS-embelin NPs (25 and 50 mg/kg) significantly reduced serum levels and down-regulated inflammatory markers to normalcy, dose-dependently. The results suggest that CS-embelin NPs displayed a protective effect against adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats mediated through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.",

The key features of action of AJSAF were investigated in mice immunized with Newcastle disease virus-based recombinant influenza vaccine (rL-H5) and AJSAF at the same leg (AJSAF+rL-H5) or different legs (AJSAF/rL-H5). The adjuvant activity of AJSAF on rL-H5 is strictly dependent on their spatial colocalization. Serum H5 antigen (H5Ag)-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers in AJSAF+rL-H5 group were significantly higher than those in AJSAF/rL-H5 group. The mechanisms of selectivity of Th1 or Th2 in mice induced by AJSAF was explored by the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of H5Ag-stimulated splenocytes from the immunized mice using gene microarray and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Compared to rL-H5 alone, AJSAF/rL-H5 induced more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than AJSAF+rL-H5, whereas AJSAF+rL-H5 upregulated higher mRNA expression of Th1 (T-bet, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12\u03b2, and IL-12R\u03b21) and Th2 (IL-10 and AICDA) immune response genes. The neutrophil response and its derived S100A8 and S100A9 might be involved in the AJSAF-mediated Th1 response. Meanwhile, AJSAF might induce the adaptive immune responses by improving a local innate immune microenvironment.

However, these are insufficient to avoid the spread of the disease in specific countries worldwide. As a consequence, prophylactic vaccination could be interesting, although no effective candidate against human disease is available. In the present study, the Leishmania infantum amastin protein was evaluated regarding its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against experimental VL. BALB/c mice immunized with subcutaneous injections of the recombinant protein with or without liposome/saponin (Lip/Sap) as an adjuvant. After immunization, half of the animals per group were euthanized and immunological evaluations were performed, while the others were challenged with L. infantum promastigotes. Forty-five days after infection, the animals were euthanized and parasitological and immunological evaluations were performed. Results showed the development of a Th1-type immune response in rAmastin-Lip and rAmastin-Sap/vaccinated mice, before and after infection, which was based on the production of protein and parasite-specific IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, GM-CSF, and nitrite, as well as the IgG2a isotype antibody. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were mainly responsible for IFN-\u03b3 production in vaccinated mice, which also presented significant reductions in parasitism in their liver, spleen, draining lymph nodes, and bone marrow. In addition, PBMC cultures of treated VL patients and healthy subjects stimulated with rAmastin showed lymphoproliferation and higher IFN-\u03b3 production.

In a phase 1 clinical trial of older adults, the vaccine demonstrated broadly cross-reactive A(H3N2) HA antibody responses. Two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies derived from NIV-immunized mice were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), antibody competition assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and protein-protein docking. These antibodies recognize two conserved regions of the head domain, namely the receptor binding site and the vestigial esterase subdomain, thus demonstrating the potential for an HA subunit vaccine to elicit antibodies targeting structurally and antigenically distinct but conserved sites. Antibody competition studies with sera from the phase 1 trial in older adults confirmed that humans also make antibodies to these two head domains and against the highly conserved stem domain. This data supports the potential of an adjuvanted recombinant HA nanoparticle vaccine to induce broadly protective immunity and improved vaccine efficacy.",

The neutralizing mAb M alpha 1 recognizes with high affinity a topographical epitope on the surface of toxin alpha, but fails to recognize the erabutoxins although they possess most of the residues forming the presumed epitope. Examinations of the toxin alpha and erabutoxin 3-D structures and molecular dynamics simulations reveal several differences between the variants. In particular, the region involving the beta-turn 17-24 is organized differently. Analysis of the differences found in this region suggest that the insertion (or deletion) at position 18 of the variant amino acid sequences is particularly important in determining the differential cross-reactivity. To test this proposal, residue 18 was deleted in one erabutoxin using site-directed mutagenesis, and the biological properties of the resulting mutant were examined.

In the present study, we have studied the assignment of slowly exchangeable amide protons of Laticauda semifasciata III from L. semifasciata, using nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) and spin-decoupling methods. The results show that nearly all of the slowly exchangeable amide protons are to be assigned to the back-bone amide protons, involved in the triple-stranded antiparallel pleated beta-sheet structure, indicating that this sheet is stable in 2H2O solution. In contrast, the amide protons in short neurotoxins are readily exchangeable under the same experimental condition, suggesting that long neurotoxins have a more rigid sheet structure than short ones. This rigidity may come from the hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interaction between the central loop and the tail, which is not present in short neurotoxins.

All toxins tested reduced responses to directly-applied ACh as well as EPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of nerve XI with similar time courses, suggesting that their action is postsynaptic.

A systematic computer search of the three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b (an alpha-neurotoxin from the false sea snake Laticauda semifasciata) was performed to identify the locality that most closely matched the amino acid compositions of the smaller alpha-conotoxins (from the marine snails Conus magus and Conus geographus). The area of greatest similarity centered on residue position 25 of erabutoxin b, a locale that is conserved throughout the snake alpha-neurotoxins and their homologues. Six proteins unrelated to erabutoxin b were compared to the alpha-conotoxins to show that the extent of the erabutoxin b/alpha-conotoxin match was too high to be coincidental. Homologues of erabutoxin b, namely alpha-cobratoxin from Naja naja siamensis and cytotoxin VII4 from Naja mossambica mossambica, were also analyzed. The extent of the matching with the alpha-conotoxins decreased in the series erabutoxin b greater than alpha-cobratoxin greater than cytotoxin VII4, and this also relates the order of similarity to the pharmacological properties of the alpha-conotoxins. The alpha-conotoxin-like area of the snake alpha-neurotoxins is peripheral to the site previously considered important for binding to the cholinoceptor, even though it seems to represent the focus of evolutionary convergence between the two types of neurotoxin.

The toxin was crystallizable and monodisperse in rechromatography, disc electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (isoelectric point, pH9.23-9.25). The molecular weight of the toxin, as estimated by gel filtration, was 7000. The toxin showed the same lethal activity to mice (0.13mug/g body wt., intramuscular injection) and the same effect on isolated frog muscle as erabutoxins a and b, the main toxic components of the venom. The toxin inhibited the acetylcholine contracture but not the potassium chloride contracture of muscle. Erabutoxin c consisted of 62 amino acid residues, containing one fewer lysine and one more histidine than erabutoxin a and one fewer lysine and one more aspartic acid (or asparagine) than erabutoxin b. Erabutoxin c was reduced, S-carboxymethylated and hydrolysed with trypsin. The only fragment different from the corresponding fragments from erabutoxin b was hydrolysed further with pepsin. One of the peptic fragments, which was assumed to have the aspartic acid (or asparagine) residue in question at the C-terminal end, was treated with carboxypeptidase A. The C-terminal residue was found to be an asparagine. It was therefore concluded that erabutoxin c was [51-asparagine]-erabutoxin b.",

Two chemical-sequence inversion errors in erabutoxin b have been discovered during refinement, corrected and subsequently confirmed in both erabutoxin b and erabutoxin a by chemical analysis. The correct sequences are His6-Gln7, hitherto unsuspected, and Ser18-Pro19. The sequence correction His6-Gln7 explains the anomalous results of 1H NMR solution studies and those of early chemical modification experiments, which were in conflict with the previously published three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b. On refinement, the five-stranded beta sheet described earlier is now shown to be discontinuous, split into a two-stranded beta loop and a three-stranded beta sheet.

A significant proportion of patients with NSAIDs-induced enteropathy are asymptomatic, but some patients develop symptomatic or complicated ulcers that need therapeutic intervention. Both inhibition of prostaglandins due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenases and mitochondrial dysfunction secondary to the topical effect of NSAIDs play a crucial role in the early process of injury. As a result, the intestinal barrier function is impaired, which allows enterobacteria to invade the mucosa. Gram-negative bacteria and endogenous molecules coordinate to trigger inflammatory cascades via Toll-like receptor 4 to induce excessive expression of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and to activate NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that processes pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 into its mature form. Finally, neutrophils accumulate in the mucosa, resulting in intestinal ulceration. Currently, misoprostol is the only drug that has a proven beneficial effect on bleeding small intestinal ulcers induced by NSAIDs or low-dose aspirin, but its protection is insufficient.

Activation of these virus sensor proteins induces type-I interferon production and represses viral replication. Recently, we reported that an RLR family member, laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), modulates RNA silencing by interacting with an RNA silencing enhancer, TAR-RNA binding protein (TRBP). However, the biological implications remained unclear. Here, we show that LGP2 enhances apoptosis by upregulating apoptosis regulatory genes during viral infection. Sendai virus (SeV) infection increased LGP2 expression approximately 900 times compared to that in non-virus-infected cells. Then, the induced LGP2 interacted with TRBP, resulting in the inhibition of maturation of the TRBP-bound microRNA (miRNA) and its subsequent RNA silencing activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that apoptosis regulatory genes were upregulated during SeV infection: caspases-2, -8, -3 and -7, four cysteine proteases with key roles in apoptosis, were upregulated directly or indirectly through the repression of a typical TRBP-bound miRNA, miR-106b. Our findings may shed light on the mechanism of apoptosis, induced by the TRBP-bound miRNAs through the interaction of TRBP with LGP2, as an antiviral defense system in mammalian cells.",

The <i>cag</i> PAI encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that mediates delivery of the CagA effector protein as well as nonprotein bacterial constituents into gastric epithelial cells. <i>H. pylori</i>-induced nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) activation and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion are attributed to T4SS-dependent delivery of lipopolysaccharide metabolites and peptidoglycan into host cells, and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation is attributed to delivery of bacterial DNA. In this study, we analyzed the bacterial energetic requirements associated with these cellular alterations. Mutant strains lacking Cag\u03b1, Cag\u03b2, or CagE (putative ATPases corresponding to VirB11, VirD4, and VirB4 in prototypical T4SSs) were capable of T4SS core complex assembly but defective in CagA translocation into host cells. Thus, the three Cag ATPases are not functionally redundant. Cag\u03b1 and CagE were required for <i>H. pylori</i>-induced NF-\u03baB activation, IL-8 secretion, and TLR9 activation, but Cag\u03b2 was dispensable for these responses. We identified putative ATP-binding motifs (Walker-A and Walker-B) in each of the ATPases and generated mutant strains in which these motifs were altered. Each of the Walker box mutant strains exhibited properties identical to those of the corresponding deletion mutant strains. These data suggest that Cag T4SS-dependent delivery of nonprotein bacterial constituents into host cells occurs through mechanisms different from those used for recruitment and delivery of CagA into host cells.",

Aligning with their predicted origin via primitive hematopoiesis, we find that HBCs are transcriptionally similar to yolk sac macrophages. Phenotypically, HBCs can be identified as HLA-DR-FOLR2+ macrophages. We identify a number of factors that HBCs secrete (including OPN and MMP-9) that could affect placental angiogenesis and remodeling. We determine that HBCs have the capacity to play a defensive role, where they are responsive to Toll-like receptor stimulation and are microbicidal.

We investigate the repertoire of antigens associated with humoral immune response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using in-depth proteomic profiling of immunoglobulin-bound proteins from PDAC patient plasmas and identify tumor antigens that induce antibody response together with exosome hallmark proteins. Additional profiling of PDAC cell-derived exosomes reveals significant overlap in their protein content with immunoglobulin-bound proteins in PDAC plasmas, and significant autoantibody reactivity is observed between PDAC cell-derived exosomes and patient plasmas compared to healthy controls. Importantly, PDAC-derived exosomes induce a dose-dependent inhibition of PDAC serum-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. In summary, we provide evidence that exosomes display a large repertoire of tumor antigens that induce autoantibodies and exert a decoy function against complement-mediated cytotoxicity.",

In this report we have used Jurkat and Raji cell lines as a model for studies of the NKG2D receptor-ligand system in T-and B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunoflow cytometry we show that Jurkat and Raji cells constitutively express mRNA and protein for the stress-inducible NKG2D ligands MICA/B and ULBP1 and 2, and up-regulate the expression in a cell-line specific and stress-specific manner. Furthermore, we revealed by electron microscopy, immunoflow cytometry and western blot that these ligands were expressed and secreted on exosomes, nanometer-sized microvesicles of endosomal origin. Acting as a decoy, the NKG2D ligand-bearing exosomes downregulate the in vitro NKG2D receptor-mediated cytotoxicity and thus impair NK-cell function. Interestingly, thermal and oxidative stress enhanced the exosome secretion generating more soluble NKG2D ligands that aggravated the impairment of the cytotoxic response. Taken together, our results might partly explain the clinically observed NK-cell dysfunction in patients suffering from leukemia/lymphoma. The adverse effect of thermal and oxidative stress, enhancing the release of immunosuppressive exosomes, should be considered when cytostatic and hyperthermal anti-cancer therapies are designed.",

The stress-induced heat shock proteins (HSPs) are known to act as endogenous \"danger signals\" that can improve tumor immunogenicity and induce natural killer (NK) cell responses. Exosome is a novel secretory pathway for HSPs. In our experiments, the immune regulatory effect of the HSP-bearing exosomes secreted by human hepatocellular carcinoma cells under stress conditions on NK cells was studied. ELISA results showed that the production of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 was up-regulated in both cell lines in a stress-specific manner. After exposure to hepatocellular carcinoma cell-resistant or sensitive anticancer drugs (hereafter referred to as \"resistant\" or \"sensitive\" anticancer drug), the membrane microvesicles were actively released by hepatocellular carcinoma cells, differing in their ability to present HSPs on the cell surface, which were characterized as exosomes. Acting as a decoy, the HSP-bearing exosomes efficiently stimulated NK cell cytotoxicity and granzyme B production, up-regulated the expression of inhibitory receptor CD94, and down-regulated the expression of activating receptors CD69, NKG2D, and NKp44. Notably, resistant anticancer drugs enhanced exosome release and generated more exosome-carried HSPs, which augmented the activation of the cytotoxic response. In summary, our findings demonstrated that exosomes derived from resistant anticancer drug-treated HepG2 cells conferred superior immunogenicity in inducing HSP-specific NK cell responses, which provided a clue for finding an efficient vaccine for hepatocellular carcinoma immunotherapy.",

Though effective treatments are currently available, many commonly used therapies have important limitations and alternative therapeutic options are needed for patients. A novel treatment approach currently in clinical trials for myasthenia gravis targets the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). This receptor plays a central role in prolonging the half-life of IgG molecules. The primary function of FcRn is salvage of IgG and albumin from lysosomal degradation through the recycling and transcytosis of IgG within cells. Antagonism of this receptor causes IgG catabolism, resulting in reduced overall IgG and pathogenic autoantibody levels. This treatment approach is particularly intriguing as it does not result in widespread immune suppression, in contrast to many therapies in routine clinical use. Experience with plasma exchange and emerging phase 2 clinical trial data of FcRn antagonists provide proof of concept for IgG lowering in myasthenia gravis.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is the generic name for a genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders characterised by retinal dystrophy or retinitis pigmentosa (appearing usually between 10 and 20 years of age), postaxial polydactyly, obesity, nephropathy, and mental disturbances, or, occasionally, mental retardation. Typically, MKKS is diagnosed (and reported) in very young children, whereas the diagnosis of BBS often is delayed to the teenage years. We report here a series of nine patients diagnosed in infancy with MKKS because of the presence of vaginal atresia and postaxial polydactyly, who later developed obesity and retinal dystrophy, thus turning out to be instances of BBS. The overlap of BBS and MKKS is a real diagnostic pitfall and its importance has to be stressed, for genetic counselling, for clinical management and follow up, and for molecular approaches. The diagnosis of MKKS should be considered with caution in all published cases described exclusively in the neonatal period and in those with mental retardation. We strongly recommend all children seen in infancy with a diagnosis of MKKS to be re-evaluated for RP and other signs of BBS.",

Although there is overlap in clinical features between MKS and BBS, MKS patients are not obese and do not develop retinopathy or have learning disabilities. To further explore the pathophysiology of BBS and the related disorder MKS, we have developed an Mkks(-/-) mouse model. This model shows that the absence of Mkks leads to retinal degeneration through apoptosis, failure of spermatozoa flagella formation, elevated blood pressure and obesity. The obesity is associated with hyperphagia and decreased activity. In addition, neurological screening reveals deficits in olfaction and social dominance. The mice do not have polydactyly or vaginal abnormalities. The phenotype of the Mkks(-/-) mice closely resembles the phenotype of other mouse models of BBS (Bbs2(-/-) and Bbs4(-/-)). These observations suggest that the complete absence of MKKS leads to BBS while the MKS phenotype is likely to be due to specific mutations.",

Herein, we present a case of MKS with prenatal ultrasound illustrating a fetal abdominal cystic mass. A 33-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, was referred to our obstetrics clinic at 34 weeks' gestation for fetal abdominal cyst detected by prenatal ultrasound. Our ultrasound illustrated a fetal abdominal cystic mass with two communicating components (suspected HMC) and polydactyly involving both hands and feet. At birth, the gross appearance revealed abdominal distention, vulva edema, and PAP. MKS was highly suspected. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) at 3 days of life showed HMC with a transverse vaginal septum. At 3 months of age, she received colpotomy and vaginal reconstruction to relieve the abdominal distension by HMC. Then she accepted corrections of PAP of both hands and feet at 8 months and 10 months. At 5 years of age, her body and mental development did not show any retardation. Pediatric ophthalmologic examination revealed no specific findings. Given the above evidences, the diagnosis of MKS was finally made at 5 years of age. Rare syndromes like MKS may need early comprehensive evaluations and consultations. Although prenatal diagnosis might be impossible for MKS, prenatal awareness by fetal ultrasound is very helpful to assist early management and maternal transfer.

Both mutant alleles were identified in only two families in Group II. Single (heterozygous) sequence variations were found in three Group I families and in two Group II families. Combining these results with previously published data showed that only one mutant allele was detected in nearly half of all patients screened to date, suggesting that unusual mutational mechanisms or patterns of inheritance may be involved. However, sequencing of the BBS2 gene in these patients did not provide any evidence of digenic or \"triallelic\" inheritance.

The ticks were collected from both wild and domestic animals and from vegetation. Of 524 ixodid ticks collected, 3, 99, and 422 ticks were identified as Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes ricinus, and Dermacentor reticulatus, respectively. DNA samples individually extracted from 168 questing and 354 engorged adult ticks were subjected to pathogen-specific PCR analyses. The mean prevalence in I. ricinus and D. reticulatus were, respectively: 10 % (10/97) and 3 % (12/422) for A. phagocytophilum; 69 % (67/97) and 52 % (220/422) for members of the Anaplasmataceae family; 25 % (24/97) and 28 % (117/422) for Rickettsia spp.; 3 % (3/97) and 1 % (6/422) for Babesia spp.; and 9 % (9/97) and 5 % (20/422) for Bartonella spp. Overall, between the five cities, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of any of the pathogens for the respective ticks (p &gt; 0.05).

In Europe, epidemiological cycles and reservoirs of A. phagocytophilum, including its zoonotic haplotypes, are poorly understood. In this study, we focused on detection and further genetic characterization of A. phagocytophilum and piroplasmids in 550 wild boars from eleven districts of Moravia and Silesia in the Czech Republic. Using highly sensitive nested PCR targeting the groEL gene, the DNA of A. phagocytophilum was detected in 28 wild boars (5.1 %) representing six unique haplotypes. The dominant haplotype was found in 21 samples from 7 different districts. All detected haplotypes clustered in the largest clade representing the European ecotype I and the dominant haplotype fell to the subclade with the European human cases and strains from dogs and horses. Nested PCR targeting the variable region of the 18S rRNA gene of piroplasmids resulted in one positive sample with 99.8 % sequence identity to Babesia divergens. The presence of these two pathogens that are primarily circulated by I. ricinus confirms the local participation of wild boar in the host spectrum of this tick and warrants experimental studies to address wild boar as a reservoir of zoonotic haplotypes of A. phagocytophilum.",

In this study, we cloned, identified, and characterised a novel MetAP from Ixodes persulcatus, a vector for pathogens causing Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. The sequence analysis showed that I. persulcatus MetAP was a type 1 enzyme carrying C-terminal motifs conserved in the M24A family of metallopeptidases. Protein-protein docking simulations using human MetAP revealed conservation of substrate and metal-binding residues in the catalytic site cleft of the novel enzyme, which was designated IpMetAP. Recombinant IpMetAP expressed in Escherichia coli revealed its significant enzymatic activity with the synthetic substrate H-Met-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide at pH 7.5 with K<sub>m</sub> of 0.014 mM, k<sub>cat</sub> of 0.25 s<sup>-1</sup>, and overall catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) of 18.36 mM<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

We found B. burgdorferi s.l. in 1.5% of Ixodes species ticks and 3.6% of small mammals. Infection was uncommon (~0.3%) in Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary vector of the Lyme disease agent to humans in western North America, but a diversity of spirochetes-including Borrelia bissettiae, Borrelia californiensis, Borrelia americana, and B. burgdorferi s.s.-were identified circulating in Ixodes species ticks and their small mammal hosts. Infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. is more common in coastal habitats, where a greater diversity of Ixodes species ticks are found feeding on small mammal hosts (four species when compared with only I. pacificus in other sampled habitats). This provides some preliminary evidence that in southern California, wetter coastal areas might be more favorable for enzootic transmission than hotter and drier climates. Infection patterns confirm that human transmission risk of B. burgdorferi s.s. is low in this region.

We aimed to identify intrinsic traits that predict which Ixodes tick species are confirmed or strongly suspected to be vectors of zoonotic pathogens. We focused on the well-studied tick genus Ixodes from which many species are known to transmit zoonotic diseases to humans. We apply generalized boosted regression to interrogate over 90 features for over 240 species of Ixodes ticks to learn what intrinsic features distinguish zoonotic vectors from non-vector species. In addition to better understanding the biological underpinnings of tick vectorial capacity, the model generates a per species probability of being a zoonotic vector on the basis of intrinsic biological similarity with known Ixodes vector species. Our model predicted vector status with over 91% accuracy, and identified 14 Ixodes species with high probabilities (80%) of transmitting infections from animal hosts to humans on the basis of their traits. Distinguishing characteristics of zoonotic tick vectors of Ixodes tick species include several anatomical structures that influence host seeking behavior and blood-feeding efficiency from a greater diversity of host species compared to non-vectors. Overall, these results suggest that zoonotic tick vectors are most likely to be those species where adult females hold a fecundity advantage by producing more eggs per clutch, which develop into larvae that feed on a greater diversity of host species compared to non-vector species. These larvae develop into nymphs whose anatomy are well suited for more efficient and longer feeding times on soft-bodied hosts compared to non-vectors, leading to larger adult females with greater fecundity. In addition to identifying novel, testable hypotheses about intrinsic features driving vectorial capacity across Ixodes tick species, our model identifies particular Ixodes species with the highest probability of carrying zoonotic diseases, offering specific targets for increased zoonotic investigation and surveillance.",

Although Alaska is home to several hard tick species, it has historically been outside of the range of the most common medically important ticks in the contiguous United States and western Canada. To assess the status of tick species establishment in the state and to provide a baseline for tracking future change in the distribution of ticks, we reviewed and compiled historical tick records and summarized recent tick occurrence records collected through the development of the Alaska Submit-A-Tick Program and through tick drag sampling at sentinel sites in southcentral Alaska. Between 1909-2019, there were 1190 tick records representing 4588 individual ticks across 15 species in Alaska. The majority of ticks were species historically found in Alaska: Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, Ixodes angustus, Ixodes auritulus, Ixodes howelli, Ixodes signatus, and Ixodes uriae. Over half of all tick records in the state were collected in the last 10 yr. During this time, the number of tick records and the number of tick species recorded in Alaska each year has increased substantially. Between 2010-2019, there were 611 tick records representing 1921 individual ticks. The most common hosts for reported ticks were domestic animals (n = 343, 56 %) followed by small wild mammals (n = 147, 24 %), humans (n = 49, 8%), and wild birds (n = 31, 5%). Less than 5% of records (n = 25) were of unattached ticks found in the environment. Since 2007, non-native tick species have been documented in the state every year, including Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor andersoni, Dermacentor occidentalis, Dermacentor variabilis, Ixodes pacificus, Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes texanus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.). Almost half of the records (n = 68, 48 %) of non-native tick species from 2010 to 2019 represented ticks found on a host (usually a dog or a human) that had traveled outside of Alaska in the two weeks prior to collection. However, A. americanum, D. variabilis, I. pacificus, I. texanus, and R. sanguineus s.l. have been found on humans and domestic animals in Alaska without reported recent travel. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that there is local establishment of R. sanguineus s.l. in Alaska. A tick species historically found in the state, I. angustus was frequently found on human and dogs, suggesting a potential role as a bridge vector of pathogens. Given the inconsistency of tick monitoring in Alaska over the past century, it is difficult to draw many conclusions from temporal trends in the data. Continued monitoring through the Alaska Submit-A-Tick Program will allow a more accurate assessment of the changing risk of ticks and tick-borne diseases in the state and provide information for setting clinical and public health guidelines for tick-borne disease prevention.",

Tick saliva has been shown to facilitate and enhance viral infection. This likely occurs by saliva-mediated modulation of host responses into patterns favorable for viral infection and dissemination. Because of the rapid kinetics of tick-borne viral transmission, this modulation must occur as early as tick attachment and initiation of feeding. In this study, cutaneous bite-site lesions were analyzed using Affymetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 arrays and histopathology at 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours after uninfected Ixodes scapularis nymphal tick attachment. At 1 and 3 hrs after attachment, the gene expression profile is markedly different than at later time points. Upregulated gene ontology term clusters enriched at 1 and 3 hrs were related to post-translational modification. At 6 and 12 hrs, cytoskeletal rearrangements, DNA replication/cell division, inflammation, and chemotaxis were prominent clusters. At 6 and 12 hrs, extracellular matrix, signaling, and DNA binding clusters were downregulated. Histopathological analysis shows minimal inflammation at 1 and 3 hrs but an appreciable neutrophil infiltrate at 6 and 12 hrs. In addition, putative hyperemia, localized necrosis, and increased ECM deposition were identified.

It requires water pools and riparian bulrush (Schoenoplectus americanus) and occupies some of the rarest habitat of any North American mammal. The minimally vegetated, extremely arid desert surrounding the pools is essentially uninhabitable for Ixodes species ticks. We describe an enzootic cycle of Borrelia carolinensis in Ixodes minor ticks at a site 3500 km distant from the region in which I. minor is known to occur in Tecopa Host Springs, Inyo County, eastern Mojave Desert, California. Voles were live-trapped, and ticks and blood samples queried by PCR and DNA sequencing for identification and determination of the presence of Borrelia spp. Between 2011-2013, we found 21 Ixodes minor ticks (prevalence 4-8%) on Amargosa voles and Reithrodontomys megalotis. DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA from ticks yielded 99% identity to I. minor. There was 92% identity with I. minor in the calreticulin gene fragment. Three ticks (23.1%), 15 (24%) voles, three (27%) house mice, and one (7%) harvest mice were PCR positive for Borrelia spp. Sequencing of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer region and flagellin gene assigned Amargosa vole Borrelia strains to B. carolinensis. Ixodes minor, first described in 1902 from a single Guatemalan record, reportedly occurs only in the southeast American on small mammals and birds. The source of this tick in the Mojave Desert and time scale for introduction is not known but likely via migratory birds. Borrelia strains in the Amargosa ecosystem most closely resemble B. carolinensis. B. carolinensis occurs in a rodent-I. minor enzootic cycle in the southeast U.S. although its epidemiological significance for people or rodents is unknown. The presence of a tick and Borrelia spp. only known from southeast U.S. in this extremely isolated habitat on the other side of the continent is of serious concern because it suggests that the animals in the ecosystem could be vulnerable to further incursions of pathogens and parasites.",

There is limited understanding of large scale entomological risk patterns of B. miyamotoi and of Borreila burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss), the agent of Lyme disease, in western North America. In this study, B. miyamotoi, a relapsing fever spirochete, was detected in adult (n=70) and nymphal (n=36) Ixodes pacificus ticks collected from 24 of 48 California counties that were surveyed over a 13 year period. Statewide prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), which includes B. burgdorferi ss, and B. miyamotoi were similar in adult I. pacificus (0.6% and 0.8%, respectively). In contrast, the prevalence of B. burgdorferi sl was almost 2.5 times higher than B. miyamotoi in nymphal I. pacificus (3.2% versus 1.4%). These results suggest similar risk of exposure to B. burgdorferi sl and B. miyamotoi from adult I. pacificus tick bites in California, but a higher risk of contracting B. burgdorferi sl than B. miyamotoi from nymphal tick bites. While regional risk of exposure to these two spirochetes varies, the highest risk for both species is found in north and central coastal California and the Sierra Nevada foothill region, and the lowest risk is in southern California; nevertheless, tick-bite avoidance measures should be implemented in all regions of California. This is the first study to comprehensively evaluate entomologic risk for B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi for both adult and nymphal I. pacificus, an important human biting tick in western North America.",

In this study the presence and identity of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Rickettsia species in Bulgarian Ixodes ricinus ticks and in non- Ixodes ticks from Turkey and Albania was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse line blot hybridization. In the adult Bulgarian ticks, the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection was approximately 40%, while Borrelia afzelii was the predominant species, representing more than half of all Borrelia-positive ticks. Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species were detected in 35% of the adult Ixodes ricinus ticks and in 10% of the nymphs. Sequence analysis of PCR products reacting with the Anaplasma phagocytophila probe revealed a 16S rRNA gene identical to that of the Anaplasma phagocytophila prototype strain. Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species were found in approximately 7% of the non- Ixodes ticks. Sequence analysis of some of these samples revealed the presence of Anaplasma ovis, Ehrlichia canis, and a species closely resembling Ehrlichia chaffeensis. About half of all adult ticks examined and approximately 20% of all nymphs were infected with Rickettsia species. In Ixodes ricinus ticks, Rickettsia helvetica and a Rickettsia species designated as IRS3 were found in high prevalence. Rickettsia conorii was found in virtually all non- Ixodes tick species from Albania and Turkey. The results of this study show that many tick-borne diseases are most probably endemic in the Balkan area. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is a considerable chance for simultaneous transmission of tick-borne pathogens to human beings.",

Even though they are endemic to New Zealand like their host, very little is known about these ticks or their population dynamics and relationships with their hosts. We conducted a study from May 2013 to June 2014 to evaluate the effect of shelter location (one of three gullies), habitat (forest, scrub and pasture) and type (tree, soil and surface) on the abundance of the different life stages of I. anatis. In total, 12,172 ticks were collected from 63 shelters, which were sampled monthly for 11 months over the 14 month period. Un-engorged larvae predominated over other stages accounting for 87.2% of the samples collected. We found that location, habitat in which the shelters were located, and the type of shelter were significant predictors of I. anatis abundance. Tree shelters in forests had significantly higher tick abundance than those in scrub and pasture. Tree and soil shelters in general had significantly more ticks than surface shelters. Shelters located in Kauri Bush a drier site, had higher abundances than those in wetter sites. While some of these changes can be explained with the movement of the host, we believe more research needs to be done on the effect of shelters' microclimate on I. anatis' life cycle.",

Male ticks collected from cave walls in Hungary showed a different morphology from those of I. vespertilionis and I. simplex. Molecular analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of these ticks verified them as conspecific to I. ariadnae. In addition, a larva of I. ariadnae was removed from a Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii Kuhl, 1817). The male of I. ariadnae is characterized by long legs (7-8mm; I. vespertilionis: 8-10mm; I. simplex: 2-2.2mm), relatively short palpal setae (30-100\u03bcm; I. vespertilionis: 100-200\u03bcm; I. simplex: 20-50\u03bcm) and straight lateral edge of palps, the genital aperture (enclosed by a line of sclerotization) situated anteriorly to second intercoxal space and rounded coxae.

DNA was extracted from one individual of each stage/sex, while another was morphometrically analysed. Based on two genetic markers, all ticks were identified as I. collaris. The male of I. collaris has long legs (i.e. the length of Haller's organ exceeds the maximum diameter of tarsus I), unlike the male of I. simplex Neumann, 1906, but similarly to males of I. vespertilionis Koch, 1844 and I. ariadnae Hornok, 2014. The lateral and medial edges of the palpi of male I. collaris are both convexly curved, unlike in I. ariadnae and I. simplex, but similarly to I. vespertilionis. The male of I. collaris has long palpal setae (up to 210 \u00b5m), unlike the males of I. ariadnae (30-100 \u00b5m) and I. simplex (20-80 \u00b5m), but similarly to I. vespertilionis (100-200 \u00b5m). Males of I. collaris have sparse distribution of long palpal setae (vs dense in I. vespertilionis) and posteriorly diverging, sclerotized trapezoid ridge dorsally on the basis capituli (posteriorly convergent, U-shaped and less evident in I. vespertilionis). The larva of I. collaris has long legs (unlike the larva of I. simplex, but similarly to I. vespertilionis and I. ariadnae), elongated club-shaped palpi (240 \u00d7 70 vs 200 \u00d7 90 \u00b5m in I. ariadnae, 200 \u00d7 70 \u00b5m in I. vespertilionis; and 140 \u00d7 60 \u00b5m in I. simplex:), pentagonal scutum, which is longer than broad (different from I. ariadnae and I. simplex, but similar to that of I. vespertilionis). The larva of I. collaris has strongly concave caudolateral margin of ventral basis with perpendicular angle (vs slightly concave, with obtuse angle in I. vespertilionis) and a prominent, dark sclerotized edge, \"collar\" (absent in I. vespertilionis).

Borreliosis otherwise known as Lyme disease is an emerging infectious disease in humans in Australia. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) and sensu lato are closely related spirochetal species that are the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans. Clinical transmission of this tick-borne disease can be identified in several but not all cases by a characteristic rash known as erythema migrans. However, there has been no study of the tick vectors of this infection in Australia. We used morphological and molecular techniques to identify unequivocally the ticks on the patients of this study to be I. holocyclus and then show the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in erythema migrans biopsies. I. holocyclus has not previously been associated with erythema migrans or Lyme disease. Two patients presented to the lead author's medical practice with erythema migrans in mid and late 2012. The morphology and cytochrome oxidase 1 and ITS2 genes of the two ticks were studied. The skin at the attachment site was sampled by central biopsy for both real time and endpoint Borrelia polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and subsequent sequencing. Morphologically, the two ticks were either I. holocyclus or I. cornuatus. Molecular studies and nucleotide sequencing revealed that both ticks were I. holocyclus. Real time and endpoint PCR on the central tissue biopsy samples returned positive results for B. burgdorferi DNA. Our results are evidence for transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto species to humans by the tick I. holocyclus in Australia.

No data is yet available regarding occurrence of I. inopinatus in northern Germany and the potential role of I. inopinatus as a vector for tick-borne pathogens. Therefore, 3845 DNA samples from Ixodes ticks collected for prevalence studies on Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., and Anaplasma phagocytophilum during the years 2010-2015 in the northern German cities of Hamburg and Hanover were differentiated into I. ricinus or I. inopinatus by sequencing a part of the 16S rRNA gene. In total, 4% (137/3845) of the sequenced ticks were assigned to the species I. inopinatus and 96% (3708/3845) to I. ricinus. The prevalence of Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., and A. phagocytophilum DNA in I. inopinatus was 34% (46/137), 46% (63/137), and 3% (4/137), respectively, whereas the prevalence of these bacteria in I. ricinus was 25% (919/3708), 47% (1729/3708), and 4% (135/3708), respectively. Compared with I. ricinus, significantly more I. inopinatus ticks tested positive for Borrelia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of I. inopinatus in northern Germany. Detection of the DNA of Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., and A. phagocytophilum in questing I. inopinatus indicates a potential role of this tick species as a vector of these pathogens, which needs to be confirmed by transmission experiments.",

Zoonotic Babesia is vectored by Ixodes ticks and is commonly transmitted in North America by Ixodes scapularis, the tick species responsible for transmitting the pathogens that also cause Lyme disease, Powassan virus, and anaplasmosis in humans. Predicted climate change is expected to impact the spread of vectors, which is likely to affect the distribution of vector-borne diseases including human babesiosis. A scoping review has been executed to characterize the global evidence on zoonotic babesiosis. Articles were compiled through a comprehensive search of relevant bibliographic databases and targeted government websites. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and characterized full-text articles using a relevance screening and data characterization tool developed a priori. This review included 1394 articles relevant to human babesiosis and/or zoonotic Babesia species. The main zoonotic species were B. microti, B. divergens, B. duncani and B. venatorum. Articles described a variety of study designs used to study babesiosis in humans and/or zoonotic Babesia species in vectors, animal hosts, and in vitro cell cultures.

The submission peak for nymphal I. pacificus and I. spinipalpis was June, while submission peak for adult I. pacificus and nymphal I. angustus was April and September, respectively. Endemic ticks commonly attached to the lower extremities of their victims, and individuals younger than 9 years old were frequently bitten. The infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Borrelia miyamotoi, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in I. pacificus ticks was 1.31%, 1.05%, and 0.52%, respectively, and the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. and A. phagocytophilum in I. spinipalpis ticks was 14.29% and 10.71%, respectively. Furthermore, two species within the B. burgdorferi s. l. complex were detected in West Coast ticks: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia lanei. I. spinipalpis had the highest Borrelia prevalence among endemic ticks, and it was caused exclusively by B. lanei. Borrelia mayonii, Babesia microti, and Ehrlichia muris-like agent were not detected in these endemic ticks. In this study, we show that many nonendemic Ixodes ticks (119/549) are most likely acquired from travel to a different geographic region. We report cases of conventionally recognized nonhuman feeders (I. spinipalpis and I. angustus) parasitizing humans. The highest pathogen prevalence in I. spinipalpis may indicate a larger public health threat than previously thought, and the enzootic life cycle and pathogenicity of B. lanei warrant further study.",

Lyme borreliosis spirochetes are primarily transmitted by tick species within this complex. It has been hypothesized that the Lyme vector ticks around the world are closely related and represent a monophyletic group. This implies that vector competence in ixodid ticks for Lyme agents might have evolved only once. To test this hypothesis, we used a molecular phylogenetic approach. Two fragments of mitochondrial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid were sequenced from 11 species in the I. ricinus complex and from 16 other species of Ixodes. Phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian methodology indicated that the I. ricinus complex is not a monophyletic group unless 3 additional Ixodes species are included in it. The known major vectors of Lyme disease agents in different areas of the world are not sister taxa. This suggests that acquisition of the ability to transmit borreliosis agents in species of Ixodes may have multiple origins.",

Cases of mammalian meat allergy have now been reported on all 6 continents where humans are bitten by ticks, in 17 countries - Australia, United States of America (USA), Europe (France, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, United Kingdom, Italy, and Norway), Asia (Korea and Japan), Central America (Panama), South America (Brazil), and Africa (South Africa and Ivory Coast). To date, in each of these countries, bites from only a single tick species have been linked to the development of mammalian meat allergy: <i>Ixodes holocyclus</i> (Australia), <i>Amblyomma americanum</i> (USA), <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> (Europe), and <i>Ixodes cajennense</i> (Panama) are confirmed as culprits, and <i>Ixodes nipponensis</i> (Japan and Korea), <i>Amblyomma sculptum</i> (Brazil), <i>Amblyomma variegatum</i> (Ivory Coast), and <i>Haemaphysalis longicornis</i> (Japan) suspected of provoking mammalian meat allergy after tick bite. Other tick species remain to be formally identified (South Africa). Identification of tick species associated with development of mammalian meat allergy is crucial to the uptake of public health measures to prevent tick bites from culprit tick species, for both individuals living in these tick-endemic areas and those who choose to visit these regions.

As with other ixodid ticks, the developmental cycle runs through three stages. In each stage a blood meal is required in order to develop to the next stage. Ixodes ricinus has been found to feed on more than 300 different vertebrate species. Usually, larval ticks feed on small mammals such as mice and become infected with various microorganisms and viruses, of which some are substantial pathogens to humans. The pathogens remain in the tick during molting and are thus transstadially transmitted to the next developmental stage. Pathogens transmitted to humans are the agents of Lyme borreliosis, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Rickettsia species, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, occasionally Francisella tularensis, and protozoal Babesia species. Within the scope of an EU project Ixodes ricinus ticks from all federal states of Austria were searched by means of PCR methods for bacterial pathogens such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia spp., Francisella tularensis, Rickettsia spp., and protozoal Babesia. Additionally, the prevalence of Bartonella spp. in this tick species was also determined. Besides the singular detection of Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis in one tick collection site the overall prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, borreliae, rickettsae and babesiae in Ixodes ricinus amounted to 15%, 14%, 6% and surprising 36% and 51%, respectively. Bartonellae were detected in about 7%.",

Morphological analysis of ticks is difficult and often leads to misidentification. Molecular techniques offer an alternative approach of tick identification. To date, no practical and reliable molecular assays for discrimination of Euro-Asian ticks are available. Our aim was to develop such an assay for discrimination between four Euro-Asian tick species of high medical importance such as Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes hexagonus, and Dermacentor reticulatus. As a basis, we have chosen conventional species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique providing a good combination of simplicity and reliability. The DNA information available on ticks was searched for orthologous loci containing stretches of sequence dissimilarity sufficient for designing species-specific primers. ITS2 locus (second internal transcribed region of the rRNA gene cluster) was found to be the most favorable for primer design. Finally, for each of the three Ixodes species a PCR was developed amplifying only for the targeted species. One PCR amplified the entire ITS2 locus of the four species and allowed discrimination of D. reticulatus from the Ixodes species on the basis of the size difference of the respective PCR products. This PCR system was successfully tested for discrimination of the ticks at different maturation stages (larva, nymph, and adult) in engorged and unfed conditions, and therefore it may be useful for large-scale epidemiological studies. Differentiation between the closely related I. ricinus and I. persulcatus, the two species most often occurring in the tick-borne diseases in Eurasia, is of special importance.",

Here we provide morphological data for the female and nymphal life stages of this novel species (Ixodes woyliei n. sp.), in combination with molecular characterisation using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1). In addition, molecular characterisation was conducted on several described Ixodes species and used to provide phylogenetic context. Ixodes spp. ticks were collected from the two remaining indigenous B. penicillata populations in south-western Australia. Of 624 individual B. penicillata sampled, 290 (47%) were host to ticks of the genus Ixodes; specifically I. woyliei n. sp., I. australiensis Neumann, 1904, I. myrmecobii Roberts, 1962, I. tasmani Neumann, 1899 and I. fecialis Warburton &amp; Nuttall, 1909.

In addition, for all test methods, log10 reductions obtained after a single application were not predictive of results after 10 applications. Choice of test method can significantly influence efficacy results. Therefore, when assessing antimicrobial efficacy data of hand hygiene products, ICPs should pay close attention to the test method used, and ensure that product comparisons are made head to head in the same study using the same test methodology.",

The following fingermark detection methods were applied: 1,2-indanedione-zinc, ninhydrin, physical developer (porous substrate); and cyanoacrylate, rhodamine 6G, magnetic powder (non-porous substrate). Comparison between hand sanitized fingermarks and non-hand sanitized fingermarks showed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizers did not result in any visible differences in fingermark quality. The non-alcoholic hand sanitizers, however, improved the quality of fingermarks developed with 1,2-indanedione-zinc and ninhydrin, and marginally improved those developed with magnetic powder. Different parameters, including time since hand sanitizer application prior to fingermark deposition and age of deposited mark, were tested to determine the longevity of increased development quality. The non-alcoholic hand sanitized marks showed no decrease in quality when aged for up to two weeks. The time since sanitizer application was determined to be an important factor that affected the quality of non-alcoholic hand sanitized fingermarks.

Recent research suggests that this seasonality in children is primarily related to viral respiratory tract infections. Regular hand washing is the most effective method to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections; unfortunately, achieving hand washing recommendations in schools is difficult. Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of hand sanitizer use in elementary schools on exacerbations among children with asthma. To describe the process of redesigning the trial in response to changes in the safety profile of the hand sanitizer as well as changes in hand hygiene practice in the schools. The original trial was a randomized, longitudinal, subject-blinded, placebo-controlled, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim was to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of hand sanitizer use in addition to usual hand hygiene practices to decrease asthma exacerbations in elementary-age children. Three events occurred that required major modifications to the original study protocol: (1) safety concerns arose regarding the hand sanitizer's active ingredient; (2) no substitute placebo hand sanitizer was available; and (3) community preferences changed regarding hand hygiene practices in the schools. The revised protocol is a randomized, longitudinal, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim is to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of a two-step hand hygiene process (hand hygiene education plus institutionally provided alcohol-based hand sanitizer) versus usual care to decrease asthma exacerbations.

Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (\u226560% ethanol or \u226570% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Whereas early clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), persons with methanol poisoning might develop severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, seizures, and blindness. If left untreated methanol poisoning can be fatal (5). Survivors of methanol poisoning might have permanent visual impairment, including complete vision loss; data suggest that vision loss results from the direct toxic effect of formate, a toxic anion metabolite of methanol, on the optic nerve (6). CDC and state partners established a case definition of alcohol-based hand sanitizer-associated methanol poisoning and reviewed 62 poison center call records from May 1 through June 30, 2020, to characterize reported cases. Medical records were reviewed to abstract details missing from poison center call records. During this period, 15 adult patients met the case definition, including persons who were American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). All had ingested an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Four patients died and three were discharged with vision impairment. Persons should never ingest alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoid use of specific imported products found to contain methanol, and continue to monitor FDA guidance (7). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning. Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, correction of acidosis, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., fomepizole), and frequently, hemodialysis.",

Methanol must never be used in such a product because oral, pulmonary and/or skin exposures can result in severe systemic toxicity and even deaths. However, sporadic cases of acute poisoning indicate that alcohol-based hand rub with undeclared methanol may be found in the market from time to time. The unexpected presence of methanol poses a serious threat to public health. Unintentional ingestion by young children and inadvertent consumption by older subjects as alcohol (ethanol) substitute can occur. Methanol is more lethal and poisoning often requires antidotal therapy, in addition to supporting therapy and critical care. However, specific therapy may be delayed because the exposure to methanol is initially not suspected. When repeatedly used as a hand rub, skin absorption resulting in chronic toxicity (e.g., visual disturbances) occurs, particularly if methanol induced desquamation and dermatitis are present. Nationwide surveillance systems, regional/international toxicovigilance networks and situational awareness among the healthcare professionals should facilitate the early detection, management and prevention of such poisoning incidents of public health significance.",

A 63-year-old man was admitted to the spine department with intractable back pain as the main symptom and diagnosed with infectious spondylitis with discitis. The patient suddenly showed mental changes, resulting in a semi-comatose mental state the first day after surgery, without seizure-like activity and asphyxia.

The patient did not tend to depend on alcohol or psychiatric medication in the past, and had no addiction. After seven months, the patient had complete bone union and independent ambulation. Acute ethanol intoxication can result in life-threatening clinical effects. One of the major problems after orthopedic surgery is delirium, with the largest number appearing after spine surgery. Hand sanitizer, mainly composed of ethanol, did not cause abnormal findings or interfere with the course of treatment of infectious spondylitis.

This manuscript provides a brief historical review of the development of infection control practices and further identifies and outlines several aspects necessary to successful program applications in austere environments. Hand hygiene remains the simplest form of infection control. Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a logistically reasonable option for most circumstances, mitigating the requirement for clean running water to facilitate more traditional \"soap and water\" methods of hand disinfection. Environmental decontamination, patient cohorting, and patient isolation based on existing colonization/infection also has demonstrated efficacy in controlling cross-contamination and is feasible in most austere environments. Finally, senior leadership engagement with deliberate planning, antimicrobial stewardship, and vigorous quality and process improvement algorithms have resulted in reduced rates of critical infections in these settings. Basic tenets of infection control can be achieved even in resource-poor environments. Meticulous attention to adhering to these principles, with support from senior medical and operational leadership, facilitates improvements in infection control outcomes. There remains, however, a need for additional robust outcomes data regarding best practices in these environments.",

We conducted a 2-group comparative effectiveness study randomly assigning participants to patient hand hygiene bundle 1 (n = 41), which included a video, a handout, and a personalized verbal electronic audio reminder (EAR) that prompted hand cleansing at 3 meal times, or patient hand hygiene bundle 2 (n = 34), which included the identical video and handout, but not the EAR. The primary outcome was alcohol-based hand sanitizer use based on weighing bottles of hand sanitizer. Participants that received the EAR averaged significantly more use of hand sanitizer product over the 3 days of the study (mean \u00b1 SD, 29.97 \u00b1 17.13 g) than participants with no EAR (mean \u00b1 SD, 10.88 \u00b1 9.27 g; t<sub>73</sub> = 5.822; P \u2264 .001). The addition of a novel verbal EAR to a patient hand hygiene bundle resulted in a significant increase in patient hand hygiene performance. Our results suggest that simple audio technology can be used to improve patient self-management of hand hygiene. Future research is needed to determine if the technology can be used to promote other healthy behaviors, reduce infections, and improve patient-centered care without increasing the workload of health care workers.",

We evaluated the virucidal efficacy of seven hand sanitizers containing various active ingredients, such as ethanol, triclosan, and chlorhexidine, and compared their effectiveness against feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and a GII.4 norovirus fecal extract. We also tested the efficacy of 50, 70, and 90% of ethanol and isopropanol. Reduction of viral infectivity was measured by plaque assay, and the number of genomic copies was determined with a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription PCR assay. Based on the results of a quantitative suspension test, only one ethanol-based product (72% ethanol, pH 2.9) and one triclosan-based product (0.1% triclosan, pH 3.0) reduced the infectivity of both MNV and FCV (by &gt;2.6 and \u22653.4 log units, respectively). Four of the seven products were effective against either MNV or FCV, whereas chlorhexidine was ineffective against both viruses. For these hand sanitizers, no correlation was found between reduced infectivity and decline of viral RNA. Ethanol and isopropanol concentrations \u226570% reduced the infectivity of MNV by \u22652.6 log units, whereas 50 and 70% ethanol reduced the infectivity of FCV by \u22652.2 log units after exposure for 5 min. The susceptibility of FCV to low pH and the relative high susceptibility of MNV to alcohols suggest that both surrogate viruses should be considered for in vitro testing of hand sanitizers.",

The goal here was to determine whether hand sanitizers that contain ethanol or isopropanol as the active microbicide might reduce transmission of these parasites. We found that treatment with these alcohols with or without drying in a rotary evaporator (to model rapid evaporation of sanitizers on hands) kills 85 to 100% of cysts of G. duodenalis and 90 to 100% of cysts of Entamoeba invadens (a nonpathogenic model for E. histolytica), as shown by nuclear labeling with propidium iodide and failure to excyst in vitro. Alcohols with or without drying collapsed the cyst walls of Giardia but did not collapse the cyst walls of Entamoeba. To validate the in vitro results, we showed that treatment with alcohols eliminated oral infection of gerbils by 1,000 G. duodenalis cysts, while a commercial hand sanitizer (Purell) killed E. invadens cysts that were directly applied to the hands.

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional \"antagonist\" and \"agonist\" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells. These functions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems, modulating brain immune and phagocytic activities, preserving the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB), and the proliferation of neural precursor cells. Recently, FTY720 have shown receptor-independent effects, including intracellular target bindings and epigenetic modulations. Many researchers have recognized the positive effects of FTY720 and launched basic and clinical experiments to test the use of this agent against stroke. Although the mechanism of FTY720 has not been fully elucidated, its efficacy against cerebral stroke is becoming clear, not only in animal models, but also in ischemic stroke patients through clinical trials. In this article, we review the data obtained from laboratory findings and preliminary clinical trials using FTY720 for stroke treatment.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776422": "The past two decades of intense research have revealed a key role of the sphingolipid molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in regulating multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes including cell proliferation and survival, cell migration, inflammatory mediator synthesis and tissue remodeling. S1P mainly acts through five high-affinity G protein-coupled S1P receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed and mediate a complex network of signaling in a cell type dependent manner. S1P receptors have become an attractive pharmacological target to interfere with S1P-mediated cellular responses, which contribute to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pioneering in this field was the synthesis of FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya\u00ae) from myriocin, one of the metabolites of the fungus Isaria sinclairii known from traditional Chinese medicine for its antibacterial and energy boosting effect. Fingolimod turned out as a very potent immunomodulatory agent that subsequently passed all clinical trials successfully and is now approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Pharmacologically, fingolimod was characterized as a non-selective agonist of all of the S1P receptors (S1PR), with the exception of S1P<sub>2</sub>, and in addition, as a selective S1P<sub>1</sub> functional antagonist by induction of irreversible S1P<sub>1</sub> internalization and degradation. Since proper lymphocyte trafficking depends on the expression of S1P<sub>1</sub> on lymphocytes, the degradation of S1P<sub>1</sub> leads to trapping and accumulation of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissue, and consequently to a depletion of lymphocytes from the blood. Novel S1PR modulators are now being developed with a more selective receptor activation profile and improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this review, we will summarize the state-of-the-art approaches that target directly or indirectly S1P signaling and may be useful as novel strategies to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

To investigate the neural substrates underlying reflexive blinking in blepharospasm patients compared to healthy controls using simultaneous functional MRI and surface electromyography. Fifteen blepharospasm patients and 15 healthy controls were recruited. Randomly timed air puffs to the left eye were used to induce reflexive eye blinks during two 8-minute functional MRI scans. Continuous surface electromyography and video recordings were used to monitor blink responses. Imaging data were analyzed using an event-related design. Fourteen blepharospasm patients (10 female; 61.6 \u00b1 8.0 years) and 15 controls (11 female; 60.9 \u00b1 5.5 years) were included in the final analysis. Reflexive eye blinks in controls were associated with activation of the right hippocampus and in patients with activation of the left caudate nucleus. Reflexive blinks in blepharospasm patients showed increased activation in the right postcentral gyrus and precuneus, left precentral gyrus, and left occipital cortex compared to controls. Dystonia severity negatively correlated with activity in the left occipital cortex, and disease duration negatively correlated with reflexive-blink activity in the cerebellum. Reflexive blinking in blepharospasm is associated with increased activation in the caudate nucleus and sensorimotor cortices, suggesting a loss of inhibition within the sensorimotor corticobasal ganglia network. The association between decreasing neural response during reflexive blinking in the cerebellum with disease duration suggests an adaptive role. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

In patients with primary blepharospasm, grey-matter increase in the putamina was observed, whereas regression analyses did not indicate a correlation between grey-matter increases and the duration of primary blepharospasm or BoNT. Grey-matter decrease was detected in the left inferior parietal lobule; here regression analyses of grey-matter decrease showed a significant (p = 0.013) correlation of grey-matter decrease with the duration of BoNT.

Specifically, in comparison to healthy controls, patients with dystonia show deficits in neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility. However, it is unclear whether cognitive inflexibility is caused by the pathomechanisms underlying primary dystonia or by confounding factors such as depression or symptom-related distraction.Methods The present study aimed to eliminate these confounds by examining cognitive flexibility in dystonia patients and in patients with similar motor symptoms but without a comparable central pathophysiology. Eighteen patients with primary blepharospasm, a common form of dystonia affecting the muscles around the eyes, and 19 patients with hemifacial spasm, a facial nerve disorder causing similar eyelid spasms, completed a computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (cWCST). The two groups were further compared on tests of global cognitive functioning, psychiatric symptoms, health status, and impulsiveness. Results Blepharospasm patients committed significantly more errors on the cWCST than patients with hemifacial spasm. Group differences were most pronounced with regard to integration errors, a measure of rule-inference processes on the cWCST. Integration errors were also associated with impulsiveness in patients with blepharospasm. Conclusions Primary blepharospasm is related to deficits in cognitive flexibility, even when blepharospasm patients are compared with patients who suffer from motor symptoms of non-dystonic origin. Our results support the possibility that cognitive inflexibility results from the specific pathophysiological processes underlying primary dystonia. (JINS, 2016, 22, 662-670).",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9163399": "The current study demonstrates that combining two mild alterations to the rat trigeminal reflex blink system reproduces the symptoms of benign essential blepharospasm, a cranial dystonia characterized by uncontrollable spasms of blinking. The first modification, a small striatal dopamine depletion, reduces the tonic inhibition of trigeminal reflex blink circuits. The second alteration, a slight weakening of the lid-closing orbicularis oculi muscle, begins an adaptive increase in the drive on trigeminal sensory-motor blink circuits that initiates blepharospasm. By themselves, neither of these modifications causes spasms of lid closure, but combined, they induce bilateral forceful blinking and spasms of lid closure. A two-factor model based on these rodent experiments may explain the development of benign essential blepharospasm in humans. The first factor, a subclinical loss of striatal dopamine, creates a permissive environment within the trigeminal blink circuits. The second factor, an external ophthalmic insult, precipitates benign essential blepharospasm. This two-factor model may also be applicable to the genesis of other cranial dystonias.",

We surgically implanted stimulating electrodes into brain areas known to supply input to the lateral division of the facial nerve nucleus to induce blinking by electrical stimulation. Single-pulse stimuli at or near the facial, parabrachial, red, and interstitial nuclei produced consistent stimulus-induced eyelid contractions. Responses were ipsilateral to stimulation, except for the interstitial nucleus where contralateral responses occurred. Little or no other movements of the face, head, or body occurred at eye-blink threshold voltages. When these sites were stimulated with pulse trains, eyelid closures followed stimulus frequency and tended to fuse into constant closure. Thresholds at each stimulus site remained constant during three days of testing. Drug treatments produced no consistent effect on eye-blink threshold from any stimulation site, even when general behaviour was affected. We conclude that these input pathways to the facial nucleus may contribute to blepharospasm and that future neurochemical and electrophysiological study of these pathways may produce a suitable animal model for understanding this disorder.",

More recently, these scales have been used to determine whether there are efficacy differences between different BoNTs in blepharospasm. However, although the scales used in these trials are able to differentiate the effects of BoNT from placebo, they may not be sensitive enough to differentiate between BoNTs. Most of the scales include only four possible points for each item, which would necessitate a 25% greater improvement in one group than the other to detect any differences. Current scales are also relatively insensitive to patients with mild disability who may experience mainly psychosocial problems related to their blepharospasm. Clinical trials comparing BoNTs that include substantial numbers of mildly affected patients may be unlikely to find differences because the scales do not adequately measure mild symptoms.

We propose that apraclonidine may be a useful short-term treatment in patients with blepharospasm, particularly during wearing off from botulinum toxin injection. Patients who had pre-mature wearing off of botulinum injection effect were evaluated before and after the administration of 2 drops of apraclonidine 0.5%-1% solution to each eye. Subjective patient impressions and examiner's impression of symptoms pre and post-apraclonidine administration were recorded.

Four patients with essential blepharospasm were diagnosed as glaucomatous during their follow-up at the Oculoplastic Service. All of them showed glaucomatous optic neuropathy and corresponding visual field defect and no clinically apparent secondary cause for their glaucoma. Forced eyelid closure may lead to intraocular pressure peaks. These patients with blepharospasm present repetitive and spasmodic eyelid contractions and the intraocular pressure rise observed during eyelid squeezing could be an additional risk factor for glaucomatous damage. Our case series suggest that patients with blepharospasm should be seriously evaluated for glaucoma.",

Although many aspects of its pathophysiological mechanisms are already known, we lack fundamental evidence on etiology, prevention, and treatment. To advance in our knowledge, we need to review what is already known in various aspects of the disorder and use these bases to find future lines of interest. Some of the signs observed in BSP are cause, while others are consequence of the disorder. Non-motor symptoms and signs may be a cue for understanding better the disease. Various cerebral sites have been shown to be functionally abnormal in BSP, including the basal ganglia, the cortex, and the cerebellum. However, we still do not know if the dysfunction or structural change affecting these brain regions is cause or consequence of BSP. Further advances in neurophysiology and neuroimaging may eventually clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated. In this manuscript, we aim to update what is known regarding epidemiology, clinical aspects, and pathophysiology of the disorder and speculate on the directions of research worth pursuing in the near future.",

Like tardive dyskinesia, blepharospasm can be disfiguring and aesthetically distressing, contributing to the increased stigmatization of patients. We report 4 patients with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, or chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia who developed neuroleptic-induced blepharospasm. In all patients, blepharospasm remitted without the reemergence of psychosis within 3 to 5 months of treatment with clozapine, 100-200 mg/day. The results suggest that clozapine may successfully treat neuroleptic-induced blepharospasm without the reemergence of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder.",

Primary blepharospasm may be associated with so-called apraxia of eyelid opening as well as dystonia in the lower face, jaw or cervical muscles. Unless there are clinical clues to a symptomatic cause, adults presenting with blepharospasm do not require extensive aetiological investigation because the condition is rarely due to an identifiable condition.

BPA is used in the production of materials such as polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins and dental sealants. Whereas, the endocrine modulating activity of BPA and its effects on reproductive health have been widely studied, its effects on the function of the immune system are poorly characterized. This might be attributable to the different BPA doses used in a diversity of animal models. Moreover, most studies of the effect of BPA on the immune response are limited to in vitro and in vivo studies that have focused primarily on the impact of BPA on the number and proportion of immune cell populations, without evaluating its effects on immune function in response to an antigenic challenge or infectious pathogens. In this review, we discuss the current literature on the effects of BPA on the function of immune system that potentially increases the susceptibility to infections by the virtue of acting as a pro-inflammatory molecule. Thus, it appears that BPA, while by such an impact might be useful in the control of certain disease states that are helped by an inflmmatory response, it can worsen the prognosis of diseases that are adversely affected by inflammation.",

Adult male mice were treated by feeding with drinking water containing BPA (0.2 \u03bcg/ml, 20 \u03bcg/ml, 200 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) for two months. Testes were collected for protein extraction or for immunohistochemical analysis. Epididymal spermatozoa were collected for sperm quality evaluation and male fertility assay by in vitro fertility (IVF). Serums were collected for detection of testosterone levels. Proteins associated with germ cell proliferation, meiosis, blood-testis barrier, and steroidogenesis production were examined in BPA-treated and control mice testes. CCK8 assay was used to detect the effect of BPA on the proliferation of GC-1 and GC-2 cells. The BPA-treated mice were characterized by decreased sperm quality, serum testosterone levels and, sub-fertile phenotype characterizing with low pregnancy rates and reduced fertilization efficiency. In lower BPA (0.2 \u03bcg/ml) treatment, PCNA and PLZF were down-expressed that indicated impaired germ cell proliferation. SYCP3 was down-expressed in BPA-treated mice, but expressions of other proteins associated with meiosis and blood-testis barrier were not significantly altered.

BPA was more potent than BPS in disturbance of lipid metabolism. A considerable similarity of BPS exposure to BPA was discovered. The key lipid remodeling in response to exposure was found to involve the cardiolipins, phosphatidylglycerols and fatty acids metabolic pathways, providing novel clues of potential mechanism in which both BPA and BPS exposure could be associated with increased risk of insulin resistance. Our study supplies the perspective into the lipidome response to environmental stress induced by BPA/BPS, and shows that BPA-free products are not necessarily safer.

Nonetheless, the study of environmental occurrence and some endocrine-disrupting activities of some bisphenols came widely into focus of research only recently. The aims of the present study were to: 1) determine the predominant bisphenols in Norwegian sewage sludge and sediment and in Czech surface waters, and 2) characterize the binding of bisphenols to a transport protein transthyretin (TTR) and their (anti-)thyroid, (anti-)progestagenic, and (anti-)androgenic activities. High-performance liquid chromatography with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization or photoionization coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-APCI/APPI-HRMS) and Chemically Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) in vitro reporter gene bioassays were used to detect the target compounds and to determine endocrine-disrupting activities, respectively. Bisphenol A (BPA), 4,4'-bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol E (BPE) were the most frequently found compounds in municipal sewage sludge. Furthermore, bisphenol TMC (BPTMC) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) frequently occurred in sediment and surface waters, respectively. BPA was the major contributor to \u01a9 of bisphenols in Norwegian sewage sludge with exception of one sample where BPF predominated. We also monitored a few bisphenols in sediment but only BPTMC was found. BPA, BPAF and BPF were the dominant bisphenols in Czech surface waters.

Bisphenol A may affect reproductive and neurological development; however, opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on bisphenol A (EFSA J, 13, 2015 and 3978) concluded that none of the available studies were robust enough to provide a point of departure for setting a tolerable daily intake for bisphenol A. In the present study, pregnant Wistar rats (n = 17-21) were gavaged from gestation day 7 to pup day 22 with bisphenol A doses of 0, 25 \u03bcg, 250 \u03bcg, 5 mg or 50 mg/kg bw/day. In the offspring, growth, sexual maturation, weights and histopathology of reproductive organs, oestrus cyclicity and sperm counts were assessed. Neurobehavioural development was investigated using a behavioural testing battery including tests for motor activity, sweet preference, anxiety and spatial learning. Decreased sperm count was found at the lowest bisphenol A dose, that is 25 \u03bcg/kg/day, but not at the higher doses. Reproductive organ weight and histology were not affected and no behavioural effects were seen in male offspring. In the female offspring, exposure to 25 \u03bcg/kg bw/day bisphenol A dose resulted in increased body weight late in life and altered spatial learning in a Morris water maze, indicating masculinization of the brain. Decreased intake of sweetened water was seen in females from the highest bisphenol A dose group, also a possible sign of masculinization. The other investigated endpoints were not significantly affected. In conclusion, the present study using a robust experimental study design, has shown that developmental exposure to 25 \u03bcg/kg bw/day bisphenol A can cause adverse effects on fertility (decreased sperm count), neurodevelopment (masculinization of spatial learning in females) and lead to increased female body weight late in life. These results suggest that the new EFSA temporary tolerable daily intake of 4 \u03bcg/kg bw/day is not sufficiently protective with regard to endocrine disrupting effects of bisphenol A in humans.",

Bisphenol A was administered orally to male rats at the dose levels of 0.2, 2 and 20 microg/Kg body weight per day for 45 days. After 24 h of the last treatment, rats were weighed and killed using anesthetic ether. The body weight of treated rats did not show significant change as compared with the corresponding control groups.

Sperm collected from the epididymis were used for sperm count and biochemical estimations. Administration of bisphenol A caused a reduction in the epididymal sperm motility and sperm count in a dose-dependent manner. The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase were decreased while the levels of H(2)O(2) and lipid peroxidation increased significantly in the treated rats as compared with the corresponding group of control animals. The results suggested that graded doses of bisphenol A elicit depletion of antioxidant defence system and induce oxidative stress in epididymal sperm of rats.

Body weight, food intake, fat mass, and hypothalamic signals related to anorexigenic control of food intake were analyzed. Results show that Bisphenol A exposure reduced body weight and food intake. In addition, the exposure decreased epididymal fat mass and adiposity, acting negatively on adipocyte volume. At hypothalamic level, Bisphenol A exposure reduced the expression of the cannabinoid receptor 1 and induced gene expression of cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript-1.

Male mice (4 wk old) were treated with BPA (50 or 500 \u03bcg/kg/d) for 8 wk. Whole-body glucose homeostasis, pancreatic islet morphology and function, and miR-338-mediated molecular signal transduction analyses were examined. We showed that BPA treatment led to a disruption of glucose tolerance and a compensatory increase of pancreatic islets insulin secretion and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (<i>Pdx1</i>) expression in mice. Inhibition of Pdx1 reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and ATP production in the islets of BPA-exposed mice. Based on primary pancreatic islets, we also confirmed that miR-338 regulated Pdx1 and thus contributed to BPA-induced insulin secretory dysfunction from compensation to decompensation. Short-term BPA exposure downregulated miR-338 through activation of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (Gpr30), whereas long-term BPA exposure upregulated miR-338 through suppression of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (Glp1r). Taken together, our results reveal a molecular mechanism, whereby BPA regulates Gpr30/Glp1r to mediate the expression of miR-338, which acts to control Pdx1-dependent insulin secretion.

Microbial dysbiosis as well as exposure to toxins including xenoestrogens are thought to be risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease development and relapse. Bisphenol-A has been shown to exert estrogenic activity in the colon and alter intestinal function, but the role that xenoestrogens, such as bisphenol-A , play in colonic inflammation has been previously described but with conflicting results. We investigated the ability of bisphenol-A to exacerbate colonic inflammation and alter microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in an acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis model. Female C57BL/6 mice were ovariectomized and exposed to bisphenol-A daily for 15 days. Disease activity measures include body weight, fecal consistency, and rectal bleeding. Colons were scored for inflammation, injury, and nodularity. Alterations in the levels of microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids known to reflect phenotypic changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Bisphenol-A exposure increased mortality and worsened disease activity as well as inflammation and nodularity scores in the middle colon region following dextran sulfate sodium exposure. Unique patterns of metabolites were associated with bisphenol-A consumption. Regardless of dextran sulfate sodium treatment, bisphenol-A reduced levels of tryptophan and several metabolites associated with decreased inflammation in the colon. This is the first study to show that bisphenol-A treatment alone can reduce microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in the colon which may be associated with increased colonic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease. Impact statement As rates of inflammatory bowel disease rise, discovery of the mechanisms related to the development of these conditions is important. Environmental exposure is hypothesized to play a role in etiology of the disease, as are alterations in the gut microbiome and the metabolites they produce. This study is the first to show that bisphenol-A alone alters tryptophan and microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in a manner consistent with autoimmune diseases, specifically inflammatory bowel diseases, regardless of dextran sulfate sodium treatment. These findings indicate a potential mechanism by which bisphenol-A negatively affects gut physiology to exacerbate inflammation.",

A previous study showed that a single intracisternal administration of bisphenol A, an endocrine disruptor, into neonatal rats caused hyperactivity. To evaluate the neural risk assessment of bisphenol A, it is very important to test the potential of the chemical via an environmental exposure route. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that oral exposure to bisphenol A would exhibit effects observed previously with direct instillation. Oral administration of 600mug/pup/day bisphenol A into male Wistar rats aged 5 days-3 weeks caused significant hyperactivity at 4-5 weeks of age. Treated rats were about 1.3 times as active in the nocturnal phase as were vehicle-treated control rats (p&lt;0.005). The long-term effects of the chemical resulted in a large reduction of immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrain at 7 weeks of age, where terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected. Furthermore, bisphenol A decreased gene expression levels of dopamine transporter in adult rats.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24171222": "The \"tolerable daily intake\" of bisphenol A, established by the European and US regulatory agencies, is based on a small number of reproductive toxicity studies in animals, mostly funded by industry, using protocols that adhere to regulatory guidelines. Many scientists consider these regulatory toxicology tests unsuitable for the evaluation of endocrine disrupters, because they cannot be used to demonstrate the effects of low doses of bisphenol A, observed in dozens of independent studies. Results obtained in studies of high doses of bisphenol A have been extrapolated to predict the effects of low-dose exposure, according to the principle that \"the dose makes the poison\". The validity of this extrapolation is disputed. Some human studies suggest that bisphenol A causes coronary heart disease, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and has harmful effects on reproduction and development. Considerable data from rodent studies suggest that low doses of bisphenol A affect reproduction, lipid metabolism and neurological development, usually following intrauterine or postnatal exposure. In France, the use of bisphenol A in infant feeding bottles has been banned since 30 June 2010, and in food packaging intended for children aged 0 to 3 years since 1 January 2013. The ban is due to be extended to all food packaging as of 1 January 2015. Bisphenol A is not the only substance present in food packaging that could interfere with endocrine function. Too little is known yet about the toxicology of bisphenol A substitutes. Several studies have shown that exposure to bisphenol A in adults and children can be greatly reduced by choosing a varied diet based on fresh foods, and by avoiding the use of plastic tableware. To reduce exposure to bisphenol A and other chemicals with hormonal activity that are present in food packaging, it seems reasonable to encourage the consumption of fresh foods, avoiding canned food and plastic packaging for storing and reheating food and beverages. These precautionary measures are most important for food and beverages intended for pregnant women and young children.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27177772": "Bisphenol A, one of the industrial chemicals used in plastics and in the coating of dishes and medical equipment, behaves as an endocrine disruptor in the human body. Bisphenol A can bind directly to several types of nuclear receptors, including steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR). SXR plays an important role in bone metabolism through the activation of osteoblasts in vitro, but SXR protein localization has not been reported in bone tissues. Additionally, it is not known whether bisphenol A acts on osteoblasts through SXR activation. Therefore, in this study, we first examined the immunolocalization of the SXR protein in human adult and fetal bone tissues. We then examined the effects of bisphenol A on human osteoblasts in vitro. SXR immunoreactivity was detected in osteoblasts, but not in osteoclasts, of both adult and fetal bone tissues. In fetal bone tissues, the mesenchymal cells or fetal connective tissue were also positive for SXR immunoreactivity. Expression of SXR target genes (tsukushi, matrilin-2, and CYP3A4) and SXR response element-luciferase activity were increased by bisphenol A treatment in normal osteoblasts transfected with SXR (hFOB/SXR) and in osteoblast-like cells (MG-63). Bisphenol A also stimulated cell proliferation and collagen accumulation in hFOB/SXR cells. These results suggest that, as in other tissues, SXR plays important roles in bone metabolism and fetal bone development and that bisphenol A may disturb bone homeostasis in both adult and fetus through SXR.",

The nature and mechanism of action of bisphenol A on liver is not clear. The aim of the present study was to investigate if bisphenol A induces oxidative stress in the liver of rats and if co-administration of vitamin C, an antioxidant, can prevent oxidative stress. Bisphenol A (0.2, 2.0 and 20 micro g/kg body weight per day) and bisphenol A+vitamin C (0.2, 2.0, 20 micro g+40 mg/kg body weight per day) was orally administered to rats for 30 days. After 24 h of the last treatment, rats were killed using overdose of anesthetic ether. Body weights of the animals and the weights of liver showed no significant changes. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase were decreased in mitochondrial and microsome-rich fractions of liver. The levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation increased in the treated rats when compared with the corresponding group of control animals. Activity of alanine transaminase, a marker enzyme of hepatic injury remained unchanged in the treated rats as compared with the corresponding control rats. Co-administration of bisphenol A and vitamin C showed no changes in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase and in the levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation as compared with the corresponding control groups. The results indicated that bisphenol A induces oxidative stress in the liver of rats by decreasing the antioxidant enzymes. Co-administration of vitamin C reversed the effects of bisphenol A-induced oxidative stress in the liver of rats.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12387626": "Bisphenol A is a widely used industrial chemical with many potential sources of human exposure. Bisphenol A is a weak estrogen and has been implicated as an \"endocrine disruptor\". This term is used for a variety of chemicals encountered in the environment which have estrogenic activity. It has been postulated that human exposure to these chemicals may elicit unwanted estrogenic effects in humans such as reduced fertility, altered development and cancer. Up to now the body burden of bisphenol A in humans is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the metabolism and toxicokinetics of bisphenol A in humans exposed to low doses since systemic bioavailability has a major influence on possible estrogenic effects in vivo. Human subjects (three males and three females, and four males for detailed description of blood kinetics) were administered d(16)-bisphenol A (5 mg). Blood and urine samples were taken in intervals (up to 96 h), metabolites formed were identified by GC/MS and LC-MS/MS and quantified by GC/MS-NCI and LC-MS/MS. d(16)-Bisphenol A glucuronide was the only metabolite of d(16)-bisphenol A detected in urine and blood samples, and concentrations of free d(16)-bisphenol A were below the limit of detection both in urine (6 nM) and blood samples (10 nM). d(16)-Bisphenol A glucuronide was cleared from human blood and excreted with urine with terminal half-lives of less than 6 h; the applied doses were completely recovered in urine as d(16)-bisphenol A glucuronide. Maximum blood levels of d(16)-bisphenol A glucuronide (approximately 800 nM) were measured 80 min after oral administration of d(16)-bisphenol A (5 mg). The obtained data indicate major species differences in the disposition of bisphenol A. Enterohepatic circulation of bisphenol A glucuronide in rats results in a slow rate of excretion, whereas bisphenol A is rapidly conjugated and excreted by humans due to the absence of enterohepatic circulation. The efficient glucuronidation of bisphenol A and the rapid excretion of the formed glucuronide result in a low body burden of the estrogenic bisphenol A in humans following oral absorption of low doses.",

The molecule leaches out into the food, increasingly if exposed to warm temperatures and high acidity. BPA is known for many negative effects on the human body; for instance it acts as an xenoestrogen and influences fertility and gestation and might also have carcinogenic effects, causing breast and prostate cancer. Although it has not yet been proven as a direct cause of autoimmunity, many of the effects of BPA can be related to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (AID). Its estrogenic behavior modulates the immune system, it encourages the secretion of Prolactin that is known to be associated to AID, it creates oxidative stress that triggers the immune system and so on. Therefore there is room to advise individuals at risk for AID to avoid the consumption of BPA, similar to guidelines for pregnant women.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22470480": "Bisphenol-A (BPA) is one of the most widespread endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) used as the base compound in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics. Although evidence points to consider exposure to BPA as a risk factor for insulin resistance, its actions on whole body metabolism and on insulin-sensitive tissues are still unclear. The aim of the present work was to study the effects of low doses of BPA in insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues and whole body metabolism in adult mice. Adult mice were treated with subcutaneous injection of 100 \u00b5g/kg BPA or vehicle for 8 days. Whole body energy homeostasis was assessed with in vivo indirect calorimetry. Insulin signaling assays were conducted by western blot analysis. Mice treated with BPA were insulin resistant and had increased glucose-stimulated insulin release. BPA-treated mice had decreased food intake, lower body temperature and locomotor activity compared to control. In skeletal muscle, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor \u03b2 subunit was impaired in BPA-treated mice. This impairment was associated with a reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the Thr(308) residue. Both skeletal muscle and liver displayed an upregulation of IRS-1 protein by BPA. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was also impaired in the skeletal muscle from BPA-treated mice. In the liver, BPA effects were of lesser intensity with decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor \u03b2 subunit.In conclusion, short-term treatment with low doses of BPA slows down whole body energy metabolism and disrupts insulin signaling in peripheral tissues. Thus, our findings support the notion that BPA can be considered a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes.",

This is relevant because BPA is chronically present in our environment with the potential for constant exposure, making it functionally equivalent to a persistent compound.

Mucins, as the major salivary proteins, are also important proteins for the food oral processing and digestion. The interactions of salivary mucins and saliva with several food proteins and food protein emulsions, as well as their functional properties related to the food oral processing were reviewed in this paper. The target food proteins of focus were whey proteins (lactoferrin and beta-lactoglobulin) and non-whey proteins (casein, gelatin, galectin/lectin, and proline-rich proteins). Most of the studies suggest that electrostatic attraction (between positively charged food proteins with negatively charged moieties of mucin mainly on glycosylated region of mucin) is the major mode of interaction between them. On the other hand, casein attracts the salivary proteins only via non-covalent interactions due to its naturally self-assembled micellar structure. Moreover, recent studies related to \u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG)-mucin interactions have clarified the importance of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, <i>in vitro</i> studies between protein emulsions and saliva observed a strong aggregating effect of saliva on caseinate and whey proteins as well as on surfactant-stabilized emulsions. Besides, the sign and the density of the charge on the surface of the protein emulsion droplets contribute significantly to the behavior of the emulsion when mixed with saliva. Other studies also suggested that the interactions between saliva and whey proteins depends on the pH in addition to the flow rate of the saliva. Overall, the role of interactions of food proteins and food protein emulsions with mucin/saliva-proteins in the oral perception, as well as the physicochemical and structural changes of proteins were discussed.",

Further comparison with available data demonstrated simultaneously a low diversity in terms of variety of accessions and a high complexity in terms of number of protein spots identifying the same accession, the two thirds of identified spots corresponding to amylases, cystatins and immunoglobulins.

However, besides changes in volume, little is known about the effects that food odours have on the composition of saliva. The aim of the present study was to access the effects that smelling bread has on saliva proteome and to compare such effects with those of chewing and ingesting it. Besides a significant increase in saliva flow rate, together with a decrease in total protein concentration, bread odour induced changes in the proportion of different salivary proteins. The expression levels of two spots of cystatins and two spots of amylase increased due to olfactory stimulation, similar to what happened with bread mastication, suggesting that odour can allow anticipation of the type of food eaten and consequently the physiological oral changes necessary to that ingestion. An interesting finding was that bread odour increased the expression levels of several protein spots of immunoglobulin chains, which were decreased by both bread or rice mastication. This may be of clinical relevance since food olfactory stimulation of salivary immunoglobulins can be used to potentiate the oral immune function of saliva. Moreover, the effects of bread odour in the levels of salivary proteins, previously observed to be involved in oral food processing led to the hypothesis of an influence of this odour in the sensory perception of foods further ingested. Further studies are needed to elucidate this point, as well as whether the changes observed for bread odour are specific, or if different food odours lead to similar salivary proteome responses.",

The study involved 40 patients with plaque psoriasis and 40 generally healthy subjects matched by age and gender to the study group patients. We assayed the concentration/activity of antioxidant enzymes: salivary peroxidase (Px), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) measured in unstimulated saliva (NWS), stimulated saliva (SWS), and erythrocytes. In plasma as well as NWS and SWS, we measured the concentration/activity of reduced glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant potential (TAC), total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), and markers of oxidative modification of proteins: advanced glycation end products (AGE), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and lipid oxidation products: malondialdehyde (MDA) and total lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH). In NWS and SWS, we also evaluated the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The concentration of Px, CAT, and SOD was significantly higher in NWS of patients with plaque psoriasis vs. healthy subjects. In SWS of psoriatic patients, we observed considerably higher concentration of Px and CAT, and in erythrocytes of patients with plaque psoriasis, the concentration of GPx and CAT was significantly higher compared to that in the controls. The levels of AOPP, AGE, MDA, and LOOH were considerably higher in NWS, SWS, and plasma of the study group compared to the controls. The concentration of total protein and salivary amylase was significantly lower in NWS and SWS of psoriatic patients compared to the healthy control. In the course of plaque psoriasis, we observed redox imbalances with prevalence of oxidation reactions. Mechanisms involved in the synthesis/secretion of proteins and activity of amylase were depressed in both glands of psoriatic patients; however, they were more inhibited in the parotid gland compared to the submandibular gland.

Therefore, it has become indispensable to shorten the long list of miRNA-target interactions to put in the spotlight in order to gain insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism orchestrated by miRNAs in various cellular processes. A reasonable solution is certainly to prioritize miRNA-target interactions to maximize the effectiveness of the downstream analysis. We propose a new and easy-to-use web tool MIENTURNET (MicroRNA ENrichment TURned NETwork) that receives in input a list of miRNAs or mRNAs and tackles the problem of prioritizing miRNA-target interactions by performing a statistical analysis followed by a fully featured network-based visualization and analysis. The statistics is used to assess the significance of an over-representation of miRNA-target interactions and then MIENTURNET filters based on the statistical significance associated with each miRNA-target interaction. In addition, the holistic approach of the network theory is used to infer possible evidences of miRNA regulation by capturing emergent properties of the miRNA-target regulatory network that would be not evident through a pairwise analysis of the individual components. MIENTURNET offers the possibility to consistently perform both statistical and network-based analyses by using only a single tool leading to a more effective prioritization of the miRNA-target interactions. This has the potential to avoid researchers without computational and informatics skills to navigate multiple websites and thus to independently investigate miRNA activity in every cellular process of interest in an easy and at the same time exhaustive way thanks to the intuitive web interface.

These cells - called cancer stem-like cells - share certain phenotypic characteristics with untransformed stem cells and are resistant to many conventional cancer therapies, which might explain the limitations in curing human malignancies. Thus, the identification of genes controlling the differentiation of these stem-like cells is becoming a successful therapeutic strategy, owing to the promise of novel targets for treating malignancies. Recently, we developed SWIM, a software able to unveil a small pool of genes - called switch genes - critically associated with drastic changes in cell phenotype. Here, we applied SWIM to the expression profiling of glioblastoma stem-like cells and conventional glioma cell lines, in order to identify switch genes related to stem-like phenotype. SWIM identifies 171 switch genes that are all down-regulated in glioblastoma stem-like cells. This list encompasses genes like CAV1, COL5A1, COL6A3, FLNB, HMMR, ITGA3, ITGA5, MET, SDC1, THBS1, and VEGFC, involved in \"ECM-receptor interaction\" and \"focal adhesion\" pathways. The inhibition of switch genes highly correlates with the activation of genes related to neural development and differentiation, such as the 4-core OLIG2, POU3F2, SALL2, SOX2, whose induction has been shown to be sufficient to reprogram differentiated glioblastoma into stem-like cells. Among switch genes, the transcription factor FOSL1 appears as the brightest star since: it is down-regulated in stem-like cells; it highly negatively correlates with the 4-core genes that are all up-regulated in stem-like cells; the promoter regions of the 4-core genes harbor a consensus binding motif for FOSL1. We suggest that the inhibition of switch genes in stem-like cells could induce the deregulation of cell communication pathways, contributing to neoplastic progression and tumor invasiveness. Conversely, their activation could restore the physiological equilibrium between cell adhesion and migration, hampering the progression of cancer. Moreover, we posit FOSL1 as promising candidate to orchestrate the differentiation of cancer stem-like cells by repressing the 4-core genes' expression, which severely halts cancer growth and might affect the therapeutic outcome. We suggest FOSL1 as novel putative therapeutic and prognostic biomarker, worthy of further investigation.",

ApoE4 is more susceptible to proteolysis than apoE2 and apoE3 isoforms and carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms have been found in AD patients' brain. We have previously shown that a specific apoE4 fragment, apoE4-165, promotes amyloid-peptide beta 42 (A\u03b242) accumulation in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species formation, two events considered to occur early in AD pathogenesis. Here, we show that these effects are allele-dependent and absolutely require the apoE4 background. Furthermore, the exact length of the fragment is critical since longer or shorter length carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms do not elicit the same effects. Structural and thermodynamic analyses showed that apoE4-165 has a compact structure, in contrast to other carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms that are instead destabilized. Compared however to other allelic backgrounds, apoE4-165 is structurally distinct and less thermodynamically stable suggesting that the combination of a well-folded structure with structural plasticity is a unique characteristic of this fragment.

Here, using KLF4 as a paradigm, we provide a transcription-factor-centric view of chromatin reorganization and its association with three-dimensional enhancer rewiring and transcriptional changes during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. Inducible depletion of KLF factors in PSCs caused a genome-wide decrease in enhancer connectivity, whereas disruption of individual KLF4 binding sites within pluripotent-stem-cell-specific enhancers was sufficient to impair enhancer-promoter contacts and reduce the expression of associated genes.

Here, we examine the contribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-dependent signaling to the diverse physiological consequences of activating AgRP neurons. NPY-deficient mice fail to rapidly increase food intake during the first hour of either chemo- or optogenetic activation of AgRP neurons, while the delayed increase in feeding is comparable between control and NPY-deficient mice. Acutely stimulating AgRP neurons fails to induce systemic insulin resistance in NPY-deficient mice, while increased locomotor activity upon AgRP neuron stimulation in the absence of food remains unaffected in these animals. Selective re-expression of NPY in AgRP neurons attenuates the reduced feeding response and reverses the protection from insulin resistance upon optogenetic activation of AgRP neurons in NPY-deficient mice. Collectively, these experiments reveal a pivotal role of NPY-dependent signaling in mediating the rapid feeding inducing effect and the acute glucose regulatory function governed by AgRP neurons.",

These neurons regulate both processes, yet their relative contribution is unknown. Previously, using genetically targeted activator protein (AP1) alterations as a tool, we showed in adult mice that AgRP or POMC neurons are capable of inducing whole-body energy catabolism and bone accrual, with different effects on bone resorption. Here, we investigated whether co-residing neurons exert similar regulatory effects. We show that AP1 antagonists targeted to NPY-producing or CART-producing neurons in adult mice stimulate energy expenditure, reduce body weight gain and adiposity and promote trabecular bone formation and mass, yet again via different effects on bone resorption, as measured by serum level of carboxy-terminal collagen type I crosslinks (CTX). In addition, AP1 antagonists promote neurite expansion, increasing neurite number, length, and surface area in primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures.

However, whether such pathways modulate feeding through direct synaptic control of AgRP neuron activity is unknown. Here, we show that nociceptin-expressing neurons in the anterior bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (aBNST) make direct GABAergic inputs onto AgRP neurons. We found that activation of these neurons inhibited AgRP neurons and feeding. The activity of these neurons increased upon food availability, and their ablation resulted in obesity.

Present evidence has demonstrated that this canonical mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Thus, recent data demonstrated that inhibition of AMPK\u03b12 in fish hypothalamus led to decreased food intake and liver capacity to use and synthesize glucose, lipids, and amino acids. We hypothesize that a signal of abundance of nutrients from the hypothalamus controls hepatic metabolism. The vagus nerve is the most important link between the brain and the liver. We therefore examined in the present study whether surgical transection of the vagus nerve in rainbow trout is sufficient to alter the effect in liver of central inhibition of AMPK\u03b12. Thus, we vagotomized (VGX) or not (Sham) rainbow trout and then intracerebroventricularly administered adenoviral vectors tagged with green fluorescent protein alone or linked to a dominant negative isoform of AMPK\u03b12. The inhibition of AMPK\u03b12 led to reduced food intake in parallel with changes in the mRNA abundance of hypothalamic neuropeptides [neuropeptide Y (<i>npy</i>), agouti-related protein 1 (<i>agrp1</i>), and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (<i>cartpt</i>)] involved in food intake regulation. Central inhibition of AMPK\u03b12 resulted in the liver having decreased capacity to use and synthesize glucose, lipids, and amino acids. Notably, these effects mostly disappeared in VGX fish. These results support the idea that autonomic nervous system actions mediate the actions of hypothalamic AMPK\u03b12 on liver metabolism. Importantly, this evidence indicates that the well-established role of hypothalamic AMPK in energy balance is a canonical evolutionarily preserved mechanism that is also present in the fish lineage.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26083752": "Fructose is a major component of dietary sugar and its overconsumption exacerbates key pathological features of metabolic syndrome. The central fructose-metabolising enzyme is ketohexokinase (KHK), which exists in two isoforms: KHK-A and KHK-C, generated through mutually exclusive alternative splicing of KHK pre-mRNAs. KHK-C displays superior affinity for fructose compared with KHK-A and is produced primarily in the liver, thus restricting fructose metabolism almost exclusively to this organ. Here we show that myocardial hypoxia actuates fructose metabolism in human and mouse models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy through hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) activation of SF3B1 and SF3B1-mediated splice switching of KHK-A to KHK-C. Heart-specific depletion of SF3B1 or genetic ablation of Khk, but not Khk-A alone, in mice, suppresses pathological stress-induced fructose metabolism, growth and contractile dysfunction, thus defining signalling components and molecular underpinnings of a fructose metabolism regulatory system crucial for pathological growth.",

Here we demonstrate that, compared with normal hepatocytes, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells markedly reduce the rate of fructose metabolism and the level of reactive oxygen species, as a result of a c-Myc-dependent and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H1- and H2-mediated switch from expression of the high-activity fructokinase (KHK)-C to the low-activity KHK-A isoform. Importantly, KHK-A acts as a protein kinase, phosphorylating and activating phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1) to promote pentose phosphate pathway-dependent de novo nucleic acid synthesis and HCC formation. Furthermore, c-Myc, hnRNPH1/2 and KHK-A expression levels and PRPS1 Thr225 phosphorylation levels correlate with each other in HCC specimens and are associated with poor prognosis for HCC. These findings reveal a pivotal mechanism underlying the distinct fructose metabolism between HCC cells and normal hepatocytes and highlight the instrumental role of KHK-A protein kinase activity in promoting de novo nucleic acid synthesis and HCC development.",

Previously, we reported that renal injury was reduced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice which lacked both isoforms. Although both isoforms express in kidney, it has not been elucidated whether each isoform plays distinct roles in the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The aim of the study is to elucidate the role of KHK-A for DKD progression. Diabetes was induced by five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J wild-type mice, mice lacking KHK-A alone (KHK-A KO), and mice lacking both KHK-A and KHK-C (KHK-A/C KO). At 35 weeks, renal injury, inflammation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress were examined. Metabolomic analysis including polyol pathway, fructose metabolism, glycolysis, TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, and NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) metabolism in kidney and urine was done. Diabetic KHK-A KO mice developed severe renal injury compared to diabetic wild-type mice, and this was associated with further increases of intrarenal fructose, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), TCA cycle intermediate levels, and severe inflammation. In contrast, renal injury was prevented in diabetic KHK-A/C KO mice compared to both wild-type and KHK-A KO diabetic mice. Further, diabetic KHK-A KO mice contained decreased renal NAD<sup>+</sup> level with the increase of renal hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha expression despite having increased renal nicotinamide (NAM) level. These results suggest that KHK-C might play a deleterious role in DKD progression through endogenous fructose metabolism, and that KHK-A plays a unique protective role against the development of DKD.",

Members of the family exert diverse physiological functions and amongst eukaryotes appear to be restricted to the order Insecta. MRJPs constitute about 90% of total protein of royal jelly, which is secreted by nurse bees to feed the queen and growing larvae. We looked for mrjp and yellow homologues in a honeybee brain expressed sequence tags (EST) library. In addition to the five mrjp cDNAs previously characterized, we found three additional cDNAs encoding novel MRJPs and importantly, two cDNAs coding for orthologues of Drosophila yellow proteins. One yellow cDNA and all three cDNAs coding for the novel MRJPs were assembled completely, the sequence of the other yellow homologue was partially assembled. The data we present here supports the view that repeated duplications and functional divergence occurred during the evolution of MRJPs in honeybees, with even closely related MRJPs appearing to perform diverse physiological functions.

Methods for comparing interacting domains between cells and conditions are highly limited. We developed TADCompare, a method for differential analysis of boundaries of interacting domains between two or more Hi-C datasets. TADCompare is based on a spectral clustering-derived measure called the eigenvector gap, which enables a loci-by-loci comparison of boundary differences. Using this measure, we introduce methods for identifying differential and consensus boundaries of interacting domains and tracking boundary changes over time.

Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally inefficient. To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification. Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.

In this study, we tested a deep shotgun sequencing approach of honey DNA coupled with a specifically adapted bioinformatic pipeline. This methodology was applied to a few honey samples pointing out DNA sequences from 191 organisms spanning different kingdoms or phyla (viruses, bacteria, plants, fungi, protozoans, arthropods, mammals). Bacteria included the largest number of species. These multi-kingdom signatures listed common hive and honey bee gut microorganisms, honey bee pathogens, parasites and pests, which resembled a complex interplay that might provide a general picture of the honey bee pathosphere.

Plastic changes in morphology and behavior are underpinned by widespread gene expression changes. However, it is unknown if, or how, genomes are structured to ensure these robust responses. Here, we use repression of honeybee worker ovaries as a model of plasticity. We show that the honeybee genome is structured with respect to plasticity; genes that respond to an environmental trigger are colocated in the honeybee genome in a series of gene clusters, many of which have been assembled in the last 80 My during the evolution of the Apidae. These clusters are marked by histone modifications that prefigure the gene expression changes that occur as the ovary activates, suggesting that these genomic regions are poised to respond plastically. That the linear sequence of the honeybee genome is organized to coordinate widespread gene expression changes in response to environmental influences and that the chromatin organization in these regions is prefigured to respond to these influences is perhaps unexpected and has implications for other examples of plasticity in physiology, evolution, and human disease.",

Genetic defects in the myotonic dystrophies do not involve ion channel or its regulator proteins. Recent research supports a novel RNA-mediated disease mechanism of myotonia in the myotonic dystrophies. Myotonic dystrophy Type 1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region in the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. Myotonic dystrophy Type 2 is caused by CCTG repeat expansion in the first intron in Zinc Finger Protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. The expanded repeat is transcribed in RNA and forms discrete inclusions in nucleus in both types of myotonic dystrophies. Mutant RNA sequesters MBNL1, a splice regulator protein and depletes MBNL1 from the nucleoplasm. Loss of MBNL1 results in altered splicing of ClC-1 mRNA. Altered splice products do not encode functional ClC-1 protein. Subsequent loss of chloride conductance in muscle membrane causes myotonia in the myotonic dystrophies.

Skeletal muscles from ADR myotonic animals show an increased number of oxidative fibers with a lack of glycolytic fibers as well as signs of muscle hypertrophy. Through breeding ADR myotonic mice with mice harboring a MEF2-dependent reporter gene, we found that the transcriptional activity of MEF2 was dramatically enhanced in myotonic muscles. Post-translational induction of MEF2 transcriptional activity correlated with the activation of p38 MAPK and did not affect MEF2 DNA-binding affinity. Expression of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), which repress MEF2-dependent gene expression, was significantly reduced in skeletal muscles from myotonic mice. These findings suggest that the combined effects of class II HDAC deficiency and p38 MAPK activation lead to potent upregulation of MEF2 transcriptional activity, which contributes to the long-term changes in gene expression and fiber-type transformation observed in myotonic skeletal muscles. These findings provide new molecular targets for potential treatment of congenital myotonia.",

We have analysed all 24 exons of the CLCN1 gene, in a panel of 20 unrelated patients (9 with dominant and 11 with recessive mytotonia congenita). We have found five novel mutations including two missense (V5631, F708L), one nonsense (C481X), one splicing (IVS19+2T-&gt;A), and one frameshift (2264delC), and also detected the recurrent R894X mutation. These account for 10 of the 22 recessive alleles examined, while no mutations were found in the dominant form. We report three novel polymorphisms (-134T/G, 898C/A and 2154T/C). Our results support high molecular heterogeneity of these myotonias in Italian population and provide new insight for the diagnosis and genetic counselling of these diseases.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27415035": "Myotonia congenita (MC), paramyotonia congenita (PC) and sodium channel myotonias(SCM) were belonged to Non-dystrophic myotonias, in which muscle relaxation is delayed after voluntary or evoked contraction. These diseases can not be simply distinguished only based on symptoms and signs but also on genetics: more than 100 mutations in the CLCN1 gene have been associated with MC, while at least 20 mutations in the SCN4A gene have been associated with PC and SCM. Most of these genetics studies have been conducted outside China, only several MC, PC, and SCM families accepted gene scan were reported in China. Therefore we analyzed genetic mutations in CLCN1 and SCN4A in 10 Chinese families clinically diagnosed with Non-dystrophic myotonias. Our result revealed 12 potential disease-causing mutations(3 mutations were novel) that were present in the probands and affected family members. We also reviewed all available literature on mutations linked to these 3 disease in Chinese populations. Our results may help identify genetic determinants as well as clarify genotype-phenotype relationships.",

We have combined available genomics data with a comprehensive proteomics approach to get the annotated olive tree (<i>Olea europaea</i> L.) pollen proteome and define its complex allergenome. A total of 1907 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS using predicted protein sequences from its genome. Most proteins (60%) were predicted to possess catalytic activity and be involved in metabolic processes. In total, 203 proteins belonging to 47 allergen families were found in olive pollen. A peptidyl-prolyl <i>cis-trans</i> isomerase, cyclophilin, produced in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, was found as a new olive pollen allergen (Ole e 15). Most Ole e 15-sensitized patients were children (63%) and showed strong IgE recognition to the allergen. Ole e 15 shared high sequence identity with other plant, animal, and fungal cyclophilins and presented high IgE cross-reactivity with pollen, plant food, and animal extracts.",

This technique uses a short intense pulse of photons to disrupt the fluorescence of a tagged protein in a region of a sample. The fluorescent signal intensity after this bleaching is then recorded and the signal recovery used to provide an indicator of the dynamics of the protein of interest. This technique can be applied to any fluorescently tagged protein, but membrane-bound proteins present an interesting challenge as they are spatially confined and subject to specialized cellular trafficking. Several methods of analysis can be applied which can disentangle these various processes and enable the extraction of information from the recovery curves. Here we describe this technique when applied to the quantification of the plasma membrane-bound E-cadherin protein in vivo using the epidermis of the late embryo of Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) as an example of this technique.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31838186": "The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma. We have previously demonstrated that 1\u03b1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> or its less calcemic analog TX 527 exerts antiproliferative effects in endothelial cells stable expressing vGPCR. Since it is well documented that vGPCR activates the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, the aim of this study was to evaluate if Wnt/\u03b2-catenin cascade is target of 1\u03b1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> or TX 527 as part of their antineoplastic mechanism. Firstly, Western blot studies showed an increase in \u03b2-catenin protein levels in a dose and time dependent manner; and when VDR was knockdown, \u03b2-catenin protein levels were significantly decreased. Secondly, \u03b2-catenin localization, investigated by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation techniques, was found increased in the nucleus and plasma membrane after 1\u03b1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment. VE-cadherin protein levels were also increased in the plasma membrane fraction. Furthermore, \u03b2-catenin interaction with VDR was observed by co-immunoprecipitation and mRNA expression of \u03b2-catenin target genes was found decreased. Finally, DKK-1, the extracellular inhibitor of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, showed an initial upregulation of mRNA expression. Altogether, the results obtained by different techniques revealed a downregulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin cascade after 1\u03b1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> or TX 527 treatment, showing the foundation for a potential chemotherapeutic agent.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32044971": " Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hgs), a key component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), has been implicated in many essential biological processes. However, the physiological role of endogenous Hgs in the vascular system has not previously been explored. Here, we have generated brain endothelial cell (EC) specific Hgs knockout mice to uncover the function of Hgs in EC polarity and cerebrovascular stability. Knockout of Hgs in brain ECs led to impaired endothelial apicobasal polarity and brain vessel collapse in mice. We determined that Hgs is essential for recycling of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin to the plasma membrane, since loss of Hgs blocked trafficking of endocytosed VE-cadherin from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, and impaired the motility of recycling endosomes. Supportively, overexpression of the motor kinesin family member 13A (KIF13A) restored endosomal recycling and rescued abrogated polarized trafficking and distribution of VE-cadherin in Hgs knockdown ECs. These data uncover a novel physiological function of Hgs and support an essential role for the ESCRT machinery in the maintenance of EC polarity and cerebrovascular stability.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239671": "E-cadherin, a central component of the adherens junction (AJ), is a single-pass transmembrane protein that mediates cell-cell adhesion. The loss of E-cadherin surface expression, and therefore cell-cell adhesion, leads to increased cell migration and invasion. Treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC)-derived cells (SW-480 and HT-29) with 2.0 mM metformin promoted a redistribution of cytosolic E-cadherin to de novo formed puncta along the length of the contacting membranes of these cells. Metformin also promoted translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane of p120-catenin, another core component of the AJs. Furthermore, E-cadherin and p120-catenin colocalized with \u03b2-catenin at cell-cell contacts. Western blot analysis of lysates of CRC-derived cells revealed a substantial metformin-induced increase in the level of p120-catenin as well as E-cadherin phosphorylation on Ser<sup>838/840</sup> , a modification associated with \u03b2-catenin/E-cadherin interaction. These modifications in E-cadherin, p120-catenin and \u03b2-catenin localization suggest that metformin induces rebuilding of AJs in CRC-derived cells. Those modifications were accompanied by the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), as revealed by a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr<sup>397</sup> and paxillin at Tyr<sup>118</sup> . These changes were associated with a reduction in the numbers, but an increase in the size, of focal adhesions and by the inhibition of cell migration. Overall, these observations indicate that metformin targets multiple pathways associated with CRC development and progression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32187532": "Cultured pluripotent cells accumulate detrimental chromatin alterations, including DNA methylation changes at imprinted genes known as loss of imprinting (LOI). Although the occurrence of LOI is considered a stochastic phenomenon, here we document a genetic determinant that segregates mouse pluripotent cells into stable and unstable cell lines. Unstable lines exhibit hypermethylation at Dlk1-Dio3 and other imprinted loci, in addition to impaired developmental potential. Stimulation of demethylases by ascorbic acid prevents LOI and loss of developmental potential. Susceptibility to LOI greatly differs between commonly used mouse strains, which we use to map a causal region on chromosome 13 with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Our observations identify a strong genetic determinant of locus-specific chromatin abnormalities in pluripotent cells and provide a non-invasive way to suppress them. This highlights the importance of considering genetics in conjunction with culture conditions for assuring the quality of pluripotent cells for biomedical applications.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642925": "The shikimate pathway is indispensable for the biosynthesis of natural products with aromatic moieties. These products have wide current and potential applications in food, cosmetics and medicine, and consequently have great commercial value. However, compounds extracted from various plants or synthesized from petrochemicals no longer satisfy the requirements of contemporary industries. As a result, an increasing number of studies has focused on this pathway to enable the biotechnological manufacture of natural products, especially in E. coli. Furthermore, the development of synthetic biology, systems metabolic engineering and high flux screening techniques has also contributed to improving the biosynthesis of high-value compounds based on the shikimate pathway. Here, we review approaches based on a combination of traditional and new metabolic engineering strategies to increase the metabolic flux of the shikimate pathway. In addition, applications of this optimized pathway to produce aromatic amino acids and a range of natural products is also elaborated. Finally, this review sums up the opportunities and challenges facing this field.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32616740": "In plants, the shikimate pathway generally occurs in plastids and leads to the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Chorismate synthase (CS) catalyses the last step of the conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) to chorismate, but the role of CS in the metabolism of higher plants has not been reported. In this study, we found that PhCS, which is encoded by a single-copy gene in petunia (Petunia hybrida), contains N-terminal plastidic transit peptides and peroxisomal targeting signals. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein assays revealed that PhCS was localized in chloroplasts and, unexpectedly, in peroxisomes. Petunia plants with reduced PhCS activity were generated through virus-induced gene silencing and further characterized. PhCS silencing resulted in reduced CS activity, severe growth retardation, abnormal flower and leaf development and reduced levels of folate and pigments, including chlorophylls, carotenoids and anthocyanins. A widely targeted metabolomics analysis showed that most primary and secondary metabolites were significantly changed in pTRV2-PhCS-treated corollas. Overall, the results revealed a clear connection between primary and specialized metabolism related to the shikimate pathway in petunia.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538627": "Allosteric regulation is important in many biological processes, including cell signaling, gene regulation, and metabolism. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> chorismate mutase (ScCM) is a key homodimeric enzyme in the shikimate pathway responsible for the generation of aromatic amino acids, where it is allosterically inhibited and activated by Tyr and Trp, respectively. Our previous studies indicated that binding of both allosteric effectors is negatively cooperative, that is binding at one allosteric binding site discourages binding at the other, due to the entropic penalty of binding the second allosteric effector. We utilized variable temperature isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments to better understand the entropic contributions to allosteric effector binding, including changes to solvent entropy and protein conformational entropy. Upon binding either Tyr or Trp, ScCM experiences a quenching of motions on the picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale, which we could relate to a loss of protein conformational entropy. Further ITC and NMR studies were consistent with the Tyr-bound form of ScCM being associated with more water molecules compared to the Trp-bound form and Tyr binding being associated with a less positive solvent entropy change. These studies provide insight into the role of structural dynamics in ScCM function and highlight the importance of solvent entropy changes in allosteric regulation, a historically underappreciated concept.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32154231": "The most common route to produce aromatic chemicals - organic compounds containing at least one benzene ring in their structure - is chemical synthesis. These processes, usually starting from an extracted fossil oil molecule such as benzene, toluene, or xylene, are highly environmentally unfriendly due to the use of non-renewable raw materials, high energy consumption and the usual production of toxic by-products. An alternative way to produce aromatic compounds is extraction from plants. These extractions typically have a low yield and a high purification cost. This motivates the search for alternative platforms to produce aromatic compounds through low-cost and environmentally friendly processes. Microorganisms are able to synthesize aromatic amino acids through the shikimate pathway. The construction of microbial cell factories able to produce the desired molecule from renewable feedstock becomes a promising alternative. This review article focuses on the recent advances in microbial production of aromatic products, with a special emphasis on metabolic engineering strategies, as well as bioprocess optimization. The recent combination of these two techniques has resulted in the development of several alternative processes to produce phenylpropanoids, aromatic alcohols, phenolic aldehydes, and others. Chemical species that were unavailable for human consumption due to the high cost and/or high environmental impact of their production, have now become accessible.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31961458": " Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and it is suspected to affect the intestinal microbiota through inhibition of aromatic amino acid synthesis via the shikimate pathway. In vitro microbiome bioreactors are increasingly used as model systems to investigate effects on intestinal microbiota and consequently methods for the quantitation of glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in microbiome model systems are required. An optimized protocol enables the analysis of both glyphosate and AMPA by simple extraction with methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:3:1) without further enrichment steps. Glyphosate and AMPA are separated by liquid chromatography on an amide column and identified and quantified with a targeted tandem mass spectrometry method using a QTRAP 5500 system (AB Sciex). Our method has a limit of detection (LOD) in extracted water samples of &lt;2 ng/mL for both glyphosate and AMPA. In complex intestinal medium, the LOD is 2 and 5 ng/mL for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively. These LODs allow for measurement at exposure-relevant concentrations. Glyphosate levels in a bioreactor model of porcine colon were determined and consequently it was verified whether AMPA was produced by porcine gut microbiota. The method presented here allows quantitation of glyphosate and AMPA in complex bioreactor fluids and thus enables studies of the impact of glyphosate and its metabolism on intestinal microbiota. In addition, the extraction protocol is compatible with an untargeted metabolomics analysis, thus allowing one to look for other perturbations caused by glyphosate in the same sample.",

Uber-operons represent a rich set of footprints of operon evolution, whose full utilization could lead to new and more powerful tools for elucidation of biological pathways and networks than what operons have provided, and a better understanding of prokaryotic genome structures and evolution. Our prediction algorithm predicts uber-operons through identifying groups of functionally or transcriptionally related operons, whose gene sets are conserved across the target and multiple reference genomes. Using this algorithm, we have predicted uber-operons for each of a group of 91 genomes, using the other 90 genomes as references. In particular, we predicted 158 uber-operons in Escherichia coli K12 covering 1830 genes, and found that many of the uber-operons correspond to parts of known regulons or biological pathways or are involved in highly related biological processes based on their Gene Ontology (GO) assignments. For some of the predicted uber-operons that are not parts of known regulons or pathways, our analyses indicate that their genes are highly likely to work together in the same biological processes, suggesting the possibility of new regulons and pathways. We believe that our uber-operon prediction provides a highly useful capability and a rich information source for elucidation of complex biological processes, such as pathways in microbes. All the prediction results are available at our Uber-Operon Database: http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/uber, the first of its kind."
