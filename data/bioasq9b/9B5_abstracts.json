However, cancer subtypes derived from a single dataset are usually not applicable across multiple datasets from different platforms. Merging different datasets is necessary to determine accurate and applicable cancer subtypes but is still embarrassing due to the batch effect. CrossICC is an R package designed for the unsupervised clustering of gene expression data from multiple datasets/platforms without the requirement of batch effect adjustment. CrossICC utilizes an iterative strategy to derive the optimal gene signature and cluster numbers from a consensus similarity matrix generated by consensus clustering. This package also provides abundant functions to visualize the identified subtypes and evaluate subtyping performance. We expected that CrossICC could be used to discover the robust cancer subtypes with significant translational implications in personalized care for cancer patients.

Finerenone (FIN), a novel, nonsteroidal, potent, and selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, improves endothelial dysfunction through enhancing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreasing superoxide anion levels due to an upregulation in vascular and renal superoxide dismutase activity. We hypothesize that FIN reduces arterial stiffness in this model associated to the reduction in albuminuria and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 activity. Twelve-week-old MWF rats with established albuminuria and age-matched normoalbuminuric Wistar (W) rats were treated with FIN (10 mg/kg/day, once-daily oral gavage) or with vehicle (control, C) for 4 weeks. Arterial stiffness was significantly higher in mesenteric arteries (MA) of MWF-C as compared to W-C. FIN treatment significantly lowered \u03b2-index, a measure of intrinsic stiffness independent of geometry, in MWF (\u03b2MWF-FIN = 7.7 \u00b1 0.4 vs. \u03b2MWF-C = 9.2 \u00b1 0.5, p &lt; 0.05) positively correlating with urinary albumin excretion. Elastin fenestrae area in the internal elastic lamina of MA from MWF-FIN was significantly larger (+377%, p &lt; 0.05). FIN increased plasma pro-MMP-2 and decreased plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, correlating with reductions in \u03b2-index. MA from MWF-FIN exhibited higher NO bioavailability and reduced superoxide anion levels compared to MWF-C. FIN treatment reduces intrinsic arterial stiffness in MA from MWF rats associated with changes in elastin organization, normalization of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, and reduction of oxidative stress. Moreover, reduction of arterial stiffness correlates with reduction in albuminuria.",

Rodent studies have shown that MRAs can prevent adverse metabolic consequences of obesity but an elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms is missing. Here, we investigated metabolic effects of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone (FIN) in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and the signaling pathways activated by MR antagonism at level of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). C57BL/6J male mice were fed a normal diet or a HFD (with60% kcal from fat) containing or not FIN for 3 months. Metabolic parameters, adipose tissue morphology, gene and protein expression analysis were assessed. We also used brown adipocyte cultures (T37i cells) to investigate the effects of FIN-mediated MR antagonism upon lipid and mitochondrial metabolism. HFD + FIN-treated mice showed improved glucose tolerance together with increased multilocularity and higher expression of thermogenic markers at the level of iBAT, without differences in white adipose depots, suggesting an iBAT-specific effect of FIN. Mechanistically, FIN increased activation of AMP-activated protein kinase which, in turn, stimulated adipose triglyceride lipase activation, with subsequent increased expression of uncoupling protein-1 in brown adipocytes.",

However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014. To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD. Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE. Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I\u00b2 = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I\u00b2 = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I\u00b2 = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2, 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I\u00b2 = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I\u00b2 = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I\u00b2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I\u00b2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I\u00b2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I\u00b2 = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists. The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33099609": "This review covers the last 80 years of remarkable progress in the development of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) from synthesis of the first mineralocorticoid to trials of nonsteroidal MRAs. The MR is a nuclear receptor expressed in many tissues/cell types including the kidney, heart, immune cells, and fibroblasts. The MR directly affects target gene expression-primarily fluid, electrolyte and haemodynamic homeostasis, and also, but less appreciated, tissue remodelling. Pathophysiological overactivation of the MR leads to inflammation and fibrosis in cardiorenal disease. We discuss the mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal MRAs and how they differ from steroidal MRAs. Nonsteroidal MRAs have demonstrated important differences in their distribution, binding mode to the MR and subsequent gene expression. For example, the novel nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has a balanced distribution between the heart and kidney compared with spironolactone, which is preferentially concentrated in the kidneys. Compared with eplerenone, equinatriuretic doses of finerenone show more potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects on the kidney in rodent models. Overall, nonsteroidal MRAs appear to demonstrate a better benefit-risk ratio than steroidal MRAs, where risk is measured as the propensity for hyperkalaemia. Among patients with Type 2 diabetes, several Phase II studies of finerenone show promising results, supporting benefits on the heart and kidneys. Furthermore, finerenone significantly reduced the combined primary endpoint (chronic kidney disease progression, kidney failure, or kidney death) vs. placebo when added to the standard of care in a large Phase III trial.",

Increasing evidence suggests that mineralocorticoid receptor activation causes the pathogenesis and progression of chronic kidney disease. Aldosterone-induced MR activation increases inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in the kidney. MR antagonists (MRAs) have demonstrated therapeutic actions in chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetic nephropathy (DN), renal fibrosis, and drug-induced renal injury in preclinical and clinical studies. We have summarized and discussed these studies in this review. The nonsteroidal MRA, esaxerenone, recently received approval for the treatment of hypertension. It has also shown a positive therapeutic effect in phase 3 clinical trials in patients with DN. Other nonsteroidal MRA such as apararenone, finerenone, AZD9977, and LY2623091 are in different clinical trials in patients with hypertension suffering from renal or hepatic fibrotic diseases. Hyperkalemia associated with MRA therapy has frequently led to the discontinuation of the treatment. The new generation nonsteroidal MRAs like esaxerenone are less likely to cause hyperkalemia at therapeutic doses. It appears that the nonsteroidal MRAs can provide optimum therapeutic benefit for patients suffering from kidney diseases.",

We report a 6-step synthesis of (-)-finerenone, which features an enantioselective partial transfer hydrogenation of a naphthyridine using a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst with a Hantzsch ester. The process is complicated by the fact that the naphthyridine exists as a mixture of two atropisomers that react at different rates and with different selectivities. The intrinsic kinetic resolution was converted into a kinetic dynamic resolution at elevated temperature, which enabled us to obtain (-)-finerenone in both high yield and high enantioselectivity.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32910349": " We aim to review the mechanism of action and safety profile of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and discuss the differences between selective and non-selective MRAs. More specifically, finerenone is a new medication that is currently under investigation for its promising cardiovascular and nephrological effects. MRAs are well known for their utility in treating heart failure, refractory hypertension, and diverse nephropathies, namely, diabetic nephropathy. As their name denotes, MRAs inhibit the action of aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor, preventing receptor activation. This prevents remodeling, decreases inflammation, and improves proteinuria. There are not significant differences in outcomes between selective and non-selective MRAs. A new selective MRA named finerenone (originally BAY 94-8862) has shown promising results in several trials (ARTS-HF and ARTS-DN) and smaller studies. Finerenone may have a dose-dependent benefit over older MRAs, decreasing rates of albuminuria and levels of BNP and NT-ProBNP without causing a significant increase in serum potassium levels. This medication is not yet approved as it is still in phase 3 clinical trials (FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD trials). MRAs are beneficial in several disease states. Newer medications, such as finerenone, should be considered in patients with heart failure and diabetic nephropathy who may benefit from a reduction in albuminuria and BNP/NT-ProBNP. Data surrounding finerenone are limited to date. However, results from ongoing clinical trials, as well as new trials to evaluate use in other pathologies, could validate the implementation of this medication in daily practice.",

Affected patients lose ambulation by age 12 and usually die in the second to third decades of life from cardiac and respiratory failure. Symptomatic treatment includes the use of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, which are associated with side effects including weight gain, osteoporosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Novel treatment options include blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, because angiotensin as well as aldosterone contribute to persistent inflammation and fibrosis, and aldosterone blockade represents an efficacious anti-fibrotic approach in cardiac failure. Recent preclinical findings enabled successful clinical testing of a combination of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in DMD boys. The efficacy of MRAs alone on dystrophic skeletal muscle and heart has not been investigated. Here, we tested efficacy of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone as a monotherapy in a preclinical DMD model. The dystrophin-deficient, utrophin haploinsufficient mouse model of DMD was treated with finerenone and compared with untreated dystrophic and wild-type controls. Grip strength, electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, muscle force measurements, histological quantification, and gene expression studies were performed. Finerenone treatment alone resulted in significant improvements in clinically relevant functional parameters in both skeletal muscle and heart. Normalized grip strength in rested dystrophic mice treated with finerenone (40.3 \u00b1 1.0 mN/g) was significantly higher (P = 0.0182) compared with untreated dystrophic mice (35.2 \u00b1 1.5 mN/g). Fatigued finerenone-treated dystrophic mice showed an even greater relative improvement (P = 0.0003) in normalized grip strength (37.5 \u00b1 1.1 mN/g) compared with untreated mice (29.7 \u00b1 1.1 mN/g). Finerenone treatment also led to significantly lower (P = 0.0075) susceptibility to limb muscle damage characteristic of DMD measured during a contraction-induced injury protocol. Normalized limb muscle force after five lengthening contractions resulted in retention of 71 \u00b1 7% of baseline force in finerenone-treated compared with only 51 \u00b1 4% in untreated dystrophic mice. Finerenone treatment also prevented significant reductions in myocardial strain rate (P = 0.0409), the earliest sign of DMD cardiomyopathy. Moreover, treatment with finerenone led to very specific cardiac gene expression changes in clock genes that might modify cardiac pathophysiology in this DMD model. Finerenone administered as a monotherapy is disease modifying for both skeletal muscle and heart in a preclinical DMD model. These findings support further evaluation of finerenone in DMD clinical trials.",

We studied the ability of the non-steroidal MR antagonist finerenone to prevent fibrotic remodeling. In neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts, finerenone prevented aldosterone-induced nuclear MR translocation. Treatment with finerenone decreased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (74 \u00b1 15% of control, p = 0.005) and prevented aldosterone-induced upregulation of CTGF and lysyl oxidase (LOX) completely. Finerenone attenuated the upregulation of transforming growth factor \u00df (TGF-\u00df), which was induced by the Rac1 GTPase activator l-buthionine sulfoximine. Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of Rac1 (RacET) showed increased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic (63.7 \u00b1 8.0 vs. 93.8 \u00b1 25.6 \u00b5l, p = 0.027) and end-systolic (28.0 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 49.5 \u00b1 16.7 \u00b5l, p = 0.014) volumes compared to wild-type FVBN control mice. Treatment of RacET mice with 100 ppm finerenone over 5 months prevented LV dilatation. Systolic and diastolic LV function did not differ between the three groups. RacET mice exhibited overactivation of MR and 11\u00df hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. Both effects were reduced by finerenone (reduction about 36%, p = 0.030, and 40%, p = 0.032, respectively). RacET mice demonstrated overexpression of TGF-\u00df, CTGF, LOX, osteopontin as well as collagen and myocardial fibrosis in the left ventricle. In contrast, expression of these parameters did not differ between finerenone-treated RacET and control mice. Finerenone prevented left atrial dilatation (6.4 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 4.7 \u00b1 1.4 mg, p = 0.004) and left atrial fibrosis (17.8 \u00b1 3.1 vs. 12.8 \u00b1 3.1%, p = 0.046) compared to vehicle-treated RacET mice.

Novel nonsteroidal MRAs are currently developed and need to be pharmacologically characterized in comparison to classical steroidal MRAs. A mouse model of cardiac fibrosis induced by short-term isoproterenol injection was used to compare the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone and the steroidal MRA eplerenone in equi-efficient systemic MR blocking dosages. Molecular mechanisms were studied in MR-expressing H9C2/MR+ cardiomyocytes and in MR transcriptional cofactor binding assays. Both MRAs significantly inhibited an isoproterenol-mediated increase of left ventricular mass. Isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis and macrophage invasion were potently blocked by finerenone, whereas eplerenone had no significant effect. Speckle tracking echocardiography revealed a significant improvement of global longitudinal peak strain by finerenone, an effect less prominent with eplerenone. Antifibrotic actions of finerenone were accompanied by a significant inhibition of profibrotic cardiac <i>TNX</i> (<i>tenascin-X</i>) expression, a regulation absent with eplerenone. Finally, we show a higher potency/efficacy and inverse agonism of finerenone versus eplerenone in MR transcriptional cofactor binding assays indicating differential MR cofactor modulation by steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs. This study demonstrates that the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone potently prevents cardiac fibrosis and improves strain parameters in mice. Cardiac antifibrotic actions of finerenone may result from the inhibition of profibrotic TNX gene expression mediated by differential MR cofactor binding. Selective MR cofactor modulation provides a molecular basis for distinct (pre)-clinical actions of nonsteroidal and steroidal MRAs.",

The pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of finerenone (1.25-10 mg orally or 0.25-1.0 mg intravenously) were evaluated in healthy male volunteers in four crossover studies. Absolute bioavailability was assessed in volunteers receiving finerenone orally and by intravenous infusion (n = 15) and the effects of erythromycin (n = 15), verapamil (n = 13) and gemfibrozil (n = 16) on finerenone pharmacokinetics were investigated. Finerenone was also incubated with cryopreserved human hepatocytes in vitro in the presence of erythromycin, verapamil or gemfibrozil. Finerenone absolute bioavailability was 43.5% due to first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver. The geometric mean AUC<sub>0-\u221e</sub> ratios of finerenone (drug + inhibitor/drug alone) were 3.48, 2.70 and 1.10 with erythromycin, verapamil and gemfibrozil, respectively. The contribution ratio of CYP3A4 to the metabolic clearance of finerenone derived from these values was 0.88-0.89 and was consistent with estimations based on in vitro data, with the remaining metabolic clearance due to CYP2C8 involvement. Finerenone is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the gut wall and liver. Increases in systemic exposure upon concomitant administration of inhibitors of this isoenzyme are predictable and consistent with in vitro data. Inhibition of CYP2C8, the second involved metabolic enzyme, has no relevant effect on finerenone in vivo.",

No clear effects on AUC or C<sub>max</sub> were seen in participants with mild hepatic impairment. Finerenone was safe and well tolerated in all participants. The effects of mild or moderate hepatic impairment on systemic exposure of finerenone are small, consistent with its low hepatic extraction and preponderance of gastrointestinal over hepatic first-pass clearance.

However, the clinical use of available steroidal MR antagonists is restricted because of concomitant hyperkalemia especially in patients with diminished kidney function. We have recently identified a novel nonsteroidal MR antagonist, finerenone, which uniquely combines potency and selectivity toward MR. Here, we investigated the tissue distribution and chronic cardiorenal end-organ protection of finerenone in comparison to the steroidal MR antagonist, eplerenone, in 2 different preclinical rat disease models. Quantitative whole-body autoradiography revealed that [C]-labeled finerenone equally distributes into rat cardiac and renal tissues. Finerenone treatment prevented deoxycorticosterone acetate-/salt-challenged rats from functional as well as structural heart and kidney damage at dosages not reducing systemic blood pressure. Finerenone reduced cardiac hypertrophy, plasma prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, and proteinuria more efficiently than eplerenone when comparing equinatriuretic doses. In rats that developed chronic heart failure after coronary artery ligation, finerenone (1 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d), but not eplerenone (100 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d) improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function and reduced plasma prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide levels.

ARTS-DN Japan was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study. Analysis of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) at day 90 relative to baseline indicated a nominally significant effect of finerenone. The UACR at day 90 relative to baseline for each finerenone treatment group was numerically reduced compared with placebo. No serious adverse events (AEs) or deaths were reported and no patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug. Small mean increases in serum potassium level were observed in the finerenone treatment groups (0.025-0.167mmol/L) compared with the placebo group (-0.075mmol/L); no patients developed hyperkalemia.

We present the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis for efficacy and safety markers based on data from two clinical phase IIb studies: ARTS-DN (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01874431\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01874431</a>) and ARTS-DN Japan (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01968668\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01968668</a>). The pharmacokinetics of finerenone were adequately characterized, with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and body weight as influencing covariates. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve in Japanese patients did not differ from that in the global population, and the investigated pharmacokinetics were dose- and time-linear. In addition, the pharmacokinetic model provided robust individual exposure estimates to study exposure-response. The concentration-effect relationship over time for the efficacy marker urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) was well-characterized by a maximum effect model indicating saturation at high exposures. For the safety markers, a log-linear model and a power model were identified for serum potassium concentration and eGFR, respectively, indicating attenuation of effect gains at high exposures. There was no apparent ethnic effect on the investigated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. The model-predicted times to reach the full (99%) steady-state drug effect on UACR, serum potassium, and eGFR were 138, 20, and 85 days, respectively, while the pharmacokinetic half-life was 2-3 h and steady state was achieved after 2 days, indicating timescale separation. Our dose-exposure-response modeling and simulation indicates effects were largely saturated at finerenone 20 mg and doses of both 10 and 20 mg once daily appear safe and efficacious at reducing albuminuria.",

However, its effects on vascular function remain elusive. The aim of this study was to determine the functional effect of selective MR antagonism by finerenone in vascular cells in vitro and the effect on vascular remodeling following acute vascular injury in vivo. In vitro, finerenone dose-dependently reduced aldosterone-induced smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, as quantified by BrdU incorporation, and prevented aldosterone-induced endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis, as measured with a flow cytometry based caspase 3/7 activity assay. In vivo, oral application of finerenone resulted in an accelerated re-endothelialization 3 days following electric injury of the murine carotid artery. Furthermore, finerenone treatment inhibited intimal and medial cell proliferation following wire-induced injury of the murine femoral artery 10 days following injury and attenuated neointimal lesion formation 21 days following injury. Finerenone significantly reduces apoptosis of ECs and simultaneously attenuates SMC proliferation, resulting in accelerated endothelial healing and reduced neointima formation of the injured vessels. Thus, finerenone appears to provide favorable vascular effects through restoring vascular integrity and preventing adverse vascular remodeling.",

However, conflicting results were reported for its efficacy and safety. The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of finerenone versus spironolactone or eplerenone in patients with chronic heart failure. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to December 2017 for randomized controlled trials assessing finerenone treatment in patients with chronic heart failure. Data concerning the study's design, patients' characteristics, and outcomes were extracted. Risk ratio (RR) and mean differences (MD) were calculated using either fixed or random effects models. Three trials with 1520 CHF patients were included in the systematic review. In terms of anti-ventricular remodeling, we calculated the effective number of cases with a 30% reduction in NT-proBNP. Finerenone was equivalent to the existing steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist (P &lt; .05). However, the efficacy of finerenone appeared to be dose-dependent. At a dose of 10 mg/d finerenone was found to be marginally better than that of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (RR = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 1.57, P &gt; .05). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs) of finerenone at 10 mg/d was significantly lower than 25 to 50 mg/d of steroidal MRAs (RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.66-0.99, P = .04). Moreover, the serum potassium levels in the finerenone 10 mg/d group were lower than those in the 25 to 50 mg/d steroidal MRAs group (MD = -0.14, 95% CI -0.30-0.02, P = .09), whereas the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was higher in finerenone versus steroidal MRAs treated patients (MD = 2.07, 95% CI -0.04-4.17, P = .05). Finerenone reduced NT-proBNP level, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), and other biochemical indicators, in a dose-dependent manner. In terms of anti-ventricular remodeling in patient with chronic heart failure, finerenone at 10 mg/d is as effective as 20 to 50 mg/d of steroidal MRAs. However, finerenone is much safer to patients with chronic kidney disease.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26203193": "Aldosterone regulates sodium homeostasis by activating the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Hyperaldosteronism leads todeleterious effects on the kidney, blood vessels, and heart. Although steroidal antagonists such as spironolactone and eplerenone are clinically useful for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, they are associated with several side effects. Finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal MR antagonist, is presently being evaluated in two clinical phase IIb trials. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of action of finerenone and spironolactone at several key steps of the MR signaling pathway. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis approaches allowed identification of Ser-810 and Ala-773 as key residues for the high MR selectivity of finerenone. Moreover, we showed that, in contrast to spironolactone, which activates the S810L mutant MR responsible for a severe form of early onset hypertension, finerenone displays strict antagonistic properties. Aldosterone-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of MR are inhibited by both finerenone and spironolactone. However, automated quantification of MR subcellular distribution demonstrated that finerenone delays aldosterone-induced nuclear accumulation of MR more efficiently than spironolactone. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that, as opposed to spironolactone, finerenone inhibits MR, steroid receptor coactivator-1, and RNA polymerase II binding at the regulatory sequence of the SCNN1A gene and also remarkably reduces basal MR and steroid receptor coactivator-1 recruitment, unraveling a specific and unrecognized inactivating mechanism on MR signaling. Overall, our data demonstrate that the highly potent and selective MR antagonist finerenone specifically impairs several critical steps of the MR signaling pathway and therefore represents a promising new generation MR antagonist.",

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism has shown to be helpful against renal IR consequences; however, the potential benefit of novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone has to be further explored. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of finerenone to prevent the acute and chronic consequences of ischemic acute kidney injury. For the acute study (24 hours), 18 rats were divided into sham, bilateral renal ischemia of 25 minutes, and rats that received 3 doses of finerenone at 48, 24, and 1 hour before the ischemia. For the chronic study (4 months), 23 rats were divided into sham, rats that underwent 45 minutes of bilateral ischemia, and rats treated with finerenone at days 2 and 1 and 1 hour before IR. We found that after 24 hours of reperfusion, the untreated IR rats presented kidney dysfunction and tubular injury. Kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase associated to lipolacin mRNA levels were increased. In contrast, the rats treated with finerenone displayed normal kidney function and significantly lesser tubular injury and kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase associated to lipolacin levels. After 4 months, the IR rats developed chronic kidney disease, evidenced by kidney dysfunction, increased proteinuria and renal vascular resistance, tubular dilation, extensive tubule-interstitial fibrosis, and an increase in kidney transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and collagen-I mRNA. The transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease was fully prevented by finerenone. Altogether, our data show that in the rat, finerenone is able to prevent acute kidney injury induced by IR and the chronic and progressive deterioration of kidney function and structure.",

The Munich Wistar Fr\u00f6mter (MWF) rat is a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which exhibits endothelial dysfunction associated to low nitric oxide availability. We hypothesize that the new highly selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, finerenone, reverses both endothelial dysfunction and microalbuminuria. Twelve-week-old MWF (MWF-C; MWF-FIN) and aged-matched normoalbuminuric Wistar (W-C; W-FIN) rats were treated with finerenone (FIN, 10 mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle (C) for 4-week. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and albuminuria were determined the last day of treatment. Finerenone lowered albuminuria by &gt;40% and significantly reduced SBP in MWF. Aortic rings of MWF-C showed higher contractions to either noradrenaline (NA) or angiotensin II (Ang II), and lower relaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) than W-C rings. These alterations were reversed by finerenone to W-C control levels due to an upregulation in phosphorylated Akt and eNOS, and an increase in NO availability. Apocynin and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole significantly reduced contractions to NA or Ang II in MWF-C, but not in MWF-FIN rings. Accordingly, a significant increase of Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Cu/Zn-SOD protein levels were observed in rings of MWF-FIN, without differences in p22phox, p47phox or catalase levels. Total SOD activity was increased in kidneys from MWF-FIN rats. In conclusion, finerenone improves endothelial dysfunction through an enhancement in NO bioavailability and a decrease in superoxide anion levels due to an upregulation in SOD activity. This is associated with an increase in renal SOD activity and a reduction of albuminuria.",

Importantly, the coronary reserve assessed by magnetic resonance imaging was preserved (difference in myocardial perfusion before and after induction of vasodilatation, mL mg(-1) min(-1): MI-CTL: 1.1 \u00b1 0.5, nonsignificant; MI-MR(SMKO): 4.6 \u00b1 1.6 [P&lt;0.05]; MI-fine: 3.6 \u00b1 0.7 [P&lt;0.01]).

Such impairment of the coronary endothelial function on MI involved an oxidative stress that was reduced when MR was deleted in VSMCs or by finerenone treatment. Moreover, short-term incubation of coronary arteries isolated from noninfarcted animals with low-dose angiotensin-II (10(-9) mol/L) induced oxidative stress and impaired acetylcholine-induced relaxation in CTL but neither in MR(SMKO) nor in mice pretreated with finerenone. In conclusion, deletion of MR in VSMCs improved left ventricular dysfunction after MI, likely through maintenance of the coronary reserve and improvement of coronary endothelial function. MR blockage by finerenone had similar effects.",

However, their use is limited by the fear of inducing hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Finerenone is a novel nonsteroidal MRA, with higher selectivity toward the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) compared to spironolactone and stronger MR-binding affinity than eplerenone. This paper discusses the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of finerenone. The selectivity and greater binding affinity of finerenone to the MR may reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction and thereby overcome the reluctance to start and uptitrate MRAs in patients with HF and diabetic kidney disease. Studies conducted in patients with HFrEF and moderate chronic kidney disease and diabetic kidney disease, showed promising results.

While traditional steroid-based MR antagonists effectively reduce mortality rates and extend patient survival, their broad application has been limited by significant side effects, most notably hyperkalaemia. Recently, finerenone (BAY 94-8862) has emerged as a next-generation non-steroidal dihydropyridine-based MR antagonist designed to minimize off-target effects while maintaining potent efficacy. In this review, the outcomes of finerenone therapy in several diseases associated with MR activity are explored. The (pre-) clinical efficacy of finerenone is compared with that of traditional steroid-based MR antagonists. Finally, recent and ongoing clinical trials using finerenone to treat chronic HF, CKD, and diabetic nephropathy are discussed. Taken together, pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that finerenone may achieve equivalent organ-protective effects with reduced levels of electrolyte disturbance compared with traditional steroid-based MR antagonists.

The total recovery of the administered radioactivity was 101% in humans, 94.7% in dogs, and 95.2% in rats. In humans, radioactivity was mainly excreted renally (80%); in rats, it was primarily the biliary/fecal route (76%); and in dogs, excretion was more balanced. Finerenone was extensively metabolized in all species by oxidative biotransformation, with minor amounts of unchanged drug in excreta (humans: 1%; dogs, rats: &lt;9%). In vitro studies suggested cytochrome P450 3A4 was the predominant enzyme involved in finerenone metabolism in humans. Primary metabolic transformation involved aromatization of the dihydronaphthyridine moiety of metabolite M1 as a major clearance pathway with a second oxidative pathway leading to M4. These were both prone to further oxidative biotransformation reactions. Naphthyridine metabolites (M1-M3) were the dominant metabolites identified in human plasma, with no on-target pharmacological activity. In dog plasma, finerenone and metabolite M2 constituted the major components; finerenone accounted almost exclusively for drug-related material in rat plasma. For metabolites M1-M3, axial chirality was observed, represented by two atropisomers (e.g., M1a and M1b).

Comparative analyses revealed that XH1056 contains a 52 933 bp region acquired from a global clone 2 (GC2) isolate, but is otherwise closely related to the ST23 A. baumannii XH858. The acquired region in XH1056 also contains a 34 932 bp resistance island that resembles AbGRI3 and contains the armA, msrE-mphE, sul1, blaPER-1, aadA1, cmlA1, aadA2, blaCARB-2 and ere(B) resistance genes. Comparison of the XH1056 chromosome to that of GC2 isolate XH859 revealed that the island in XH1056 is in the same chromosomal region as that in XH859. As this island is not in the standard AbGRI3 position, it was named AbGRI5. XH1056 is a hybrid isolate generated by the acquisition of a chromosomal segment from a GC2 isolate that contains a resistance island in a new location-AbGRI5.

Mice that received <i>C. difficile</i> had decreased survival compared to control mice and mice receiving antibiotics only (<i>p</i> = 0.03). <i>Conclusions:</i> We have developed a novel clinical scoring system, and detailed histological grading system, that enables the objective evaluation of a murine <i>C. difficile</i> colitis model. This model allows the study of this disease in a host that demonstrates clinical and histologic signs comparable to human <i>C. difficile</i> infection.

The present study provides an overview of the biology underlying CRS and how targeted inhibition of interleukin (IL)-6 signaling may improve outcomes and the survival of patients suffering from COVID-19. Preliminary clinical results have indicated that antagonism of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), including with the FDA-approved humanized monoclonal antibody tocilizumab, can improve the outcomes of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 while maintaining a good safety profile.

Previous reports have shown that affected patients usually respond to anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antibody, but not all patients achieve remission. Here, we present a 62-year-old man meeting the criteria of TAFRO syndrome. Serum, plasma and ascites levels of cytokines, including IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor, were markedly elevated. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, and corticosteroids were initially used to treat the increase in acute inflammatory proteins and the anasarca, resulting in decreased cytokine levels. However, the patient showed a rapidly progressive course of anasarca and ascites, and an increase in acute inflammatory proteins and cytokine levels shortly thereafter. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, successfully induced remission of disease symptoms and decreased cytokine levels. The patient was successfully treated with rituximab despite being refractory to tocilizumab and corticosteroids. During our patient's clinical course, monitoring cytokine profiles, especially vascular endothelial growth factor, was useful in tracking the disease activity of TAFRO syndrome.",

This report describes the rapid improvement and stabilization of her ocular disease once tocilizumab was initiated. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor, was initiated at a dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Cystoid macular edema was significantly decreased after just two infusions and nearly resolved after five infusions. Ellipsoid zone and outer retinal integrity also improved on optical coherence tomography. The patient tolerated the medication with limited side effects. Long-term immunosuppression is the cornerstone of treatment for nonparaneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy, although success is highly variable. We report a case treated with tocilizumab with dramatic improvement in refractory macular edema and reconstitution of the ellipsoid zone on optical coherence tomography in a patient with nonparaneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy. This case highlights the potential role of treatment with an IL-6 inhibitor in autoimmune retinopathy though further studies are needed.",

In mice, IL-6 improved beta cell function and glucose homeostasis via upregulation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and IL-6 release from muscle during exercise potentiated this beneficial increase in GLP-1. This study aimed to identify whether exercise-induced IL-6 has a similar effect in humans. In a multicentre, double-blind clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity to intravenous tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor antagonist) 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, oral sitagliptin (a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor) 100 mg daily or double placebos (a placebo saline infusion every 4 weeks and a placebo pill once daily) during a 12 week training intervention. The primary endpoints were the difference in change of active GLP-1 response to an acute exercise bout and change in the AUC for the concentration-time curve of active GLP-1 during mixed meal tolerance tests at baseline and after the training intervention. Nineteen patients were allocated to tocilizumab, 17 to sitagliptin and 16 to placebos. During the acute exercise bout active GLP-1 levels were 26% lower with tocilizumab (multiplicative effect: 0.74 [95% CI 0.56, 0.98], p = 0.034) and 53% higher with sitagliptin (1.53 [1.15, 2.03], p = 0.004) compared with placebo. After the 12 week training intervention, the active GLP-1 AUC with sitagliptin was about twofold that with placebo (2.03 [1.56, 2.62]; p &lt; 0.001), while GLP-1 AUC values showed a small non-significant decrease of 13% at 4 weeks after the last tocilizumab infusion (0.87 [0.67, 1.12]; p = 0.261).

Clinical studies are investigating whether tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor) can help preserve beta cell function in patients recently diagnosed with T1D. However, in some rodent models and isolated human islets, IL-6 has been found to have a protective role for beta cells by reducing oxidative stress. Hence, we systematically investigated local tissue expression of IL-6 in human pancreas from non-diabetic, auto-antibody positive donors and donors with T1D and T2D. IL-6 was constitutively expressed by beta and alpha cells regardless of the disease state. However, expression of IL-6 was highly reduced in insulin-deficient islets of donors with T1D, and the expression was then mostly restricted to alpha cells.

Studies using normal mice and mice expressing human IL-6R suggested that this pH-dependent IL-6R dissociation within the acidic environment of the endosome resulted in lysosomal degradation of the previously bound IL-6R while releasing the free antibody back to the plasma to bind another IL-6R molecule. In cynomolgus monkeys, an antibody with pH-dependent antigen binding, but not an affinity-matured variant, significantly improved the pharmacokinetics and duration of C-reactive protein inhibition.

TNBC cells are known to secrete high levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, which promote angiogenesis and favor the growth and spread of the disease. In the present study, we have shown that the humanized anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab (Actemra) is also a potent inhibitor of IL-8 in TNBC cells. Similar effect was also obtained by specific IL-6 inhibition either by small interfering RNA or by neutralizing antibody. Likewise, neutralizing IL-8 with specific antibody downregulated IL-8 and inhibited the IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB pathways. Interestingly, simultaneous co-inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8 did not increase the effects of the single inhibitors. Additionally, we present clear evidence that tocilizumab has potent antiangiogenic effect. Indeed, tocilizumab abolished the ability of TNBC cells to induce the differentiation of endothelial cells into network-like tubular structures in vitro and impaired neovascularization in humanized breast orthotopic tumor xenografts. This was associated with tocilizumab-dependent downregulation of the main proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor A and its coactivator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, tocilizumab could be of great therapeutic value for TNBC patients through targeting angiogenesis.",

Inflammatory gene activation is inhibited in vitro by tocilizumab, a humanized antibody to IL6 receptor (IL6R). Tocilizumab inhibits global interleukin-6 (IL6) signaling, a key mechanism in chronic rheumatoid disorders. Here we studied in vivo baseline inflammatory gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 10 sALS patients, and the effects of tocilizumab (Actemra(R)) infusions. At baseline, one half of ALS subjects had strong inflammatory activation (Group 1) (8 genes up regulated &gt;4-fold, P&lt;0.05 vs. controls) and the other half (Group 2) had weak activation. All patients showed greater than four-fold up regulation of MMP1, CCL7, CCL13 and CCL24.

ELISA assay demonstrated that tocilizumab bound to sIL-6R and inhibited IL-6 binding to sIL-6R in a dose-dependent manner. The dissociation constant (Kd value) for IL-6R was determined to be 2.54+/-0.12 nmol/L by Scatchard analysis. In addition, tocilizumab had the ability to dissociate IL-6 and sIL-6R from their preformed complex. The immune complex of tocilizumab and sIL-6R did not transmit signaling. Moreover, tocilizumab suppressed the IL-6/sIL-6R complex-induced proliferation of human gp130-transfected cell, BAF-h130. In addition, tocilizumab had the ability to bind to human IL-6R expressing COS-7 cells and to suppress the growth of the IL-6-dependent myeloma cell line, KPMM2. Finally, to analyze the specificity of this antibody, the effects on signal transduction of IL-6 family cytokines such as interleukin-11 (IL-11), oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were examined using murine transfectant cell lines (BaF/IL-6R, BaF/IL-11R, BaF/OSMR, BaF/LIFR and BaF/CNTFR) that proliferate depending on IL-6, IL-11, OSM, LIF and human CNTF, respectively. Tocilizumab inhibited the proliferation of BaF/IL-6R induced by IL-6, but did not inhibit the proliferation of BaF/IL-11R, BaF/OSMR, BaF/LIFR and BaF/CNTFR cells induced by their corresponding cytokines.

The DNA-organizing mechanism of condensin depends on the energy of ATP hydrolysis but how this activity specifically promotes proper compaction and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis remains poorly understood. Purification of budding yeast condensin reveals that it occurs not only in the classical heteropentameric \"monomer\" form, but that it also adopts much larger configurations consistent with oligomerization. We use a single-DNA magnetic tweezers assay to study compaction of DNA by yeast condensin, with the result that only the multimer shows ATP-enhanced DNA-compaction. The compaction reaction involves step-like events of 200 nm (600 bp) size and is strongly suppressed by forces above 1 pN, consistent with a loop-capture mechanism for initial binding and compaction. The compaction reactions are largely insensitive to DNA torsional stress.

In most cells where cohesin loads without conferring cohesion, it does so by entrapment of individual DNAs. However, cohesin with a hinge domain whose positively charged lumen is neutralized loads and moves along chromatin despite failing to entrap DNAs. Thus, cohesin engages chromatin in non-topological, as well as topological, manners. Since hinge mutations, but not Smc-kleisin fusions, abolish entrapment, DNAs may enter cohesin rings through hinge opening. Mutation of three highly conserved lysine residues inside the Smc1 moiety of Smc1/3 hinges abolishes all loading without affecting cohesin's recruitment to CEN loading sites or its ability to hydrolyze ATP.

Stripe anchors represent major hotspots for topoisomerase-mediated lesions, which promote chromosomal translocations and cancer. In plasmacytomas, stripes can deregulate Igh-translocated oncogenes. We propose that higher organisms have coopted cohesin extrusion to enhance transcription and recombination, with implications for tumor development.",

Here, we propose that loop extrusion underlies TAD formation. In this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins, form progressively larger loops but stall at TAD boundaries due to interactions with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer simulations, we show that this model produces TADs and finer-scale features of Hi-C data. Each TAD emerges from multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to typical illustrations of single static loops. Loop extrusion both explains diverse experimental observations-including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments-and makes specific predictions for the depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. Finally, loop extrusion has potentially far-ranging consequences for processes such as enhancer-promoter interactions, orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and compaction of mitotic chromosomes.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29300120": "Chromatin loop extrusion is a popular model for the formation of CTCF loops and topological domains. Recent HiC data have revealed a strong bias in favour of a particular arrangement of the CTCF binding motifs that stabilize loops, and extrusion is the only model to date which can explain this. However, the model requires a motor to generate the loops, and although cohesin is a strong candidate for the extruding factor, a suitable motor protein (or a motor activity in cohesin itself) has yet to be found. Here we explore a new hypothesis: that there is no motor, and thermal motion within the nucleus drives extrusion. Using theoretical modelling and computer simulations we ask whether such diffusive extrusion could feasibly generate loops. Our simulations uncover an interesting ratchet effect (where an osmotic pressure promotes loop growth), and suggest, by comparison to recent in vitro and in vivo measurements, that diffusive extrusion can in principle generate loops of the size observed in the data.

We directly visualized the formation and processive extension of DNA loops by yeast condensin in real time. Our findings constitute unambiguous evidence for loop extrusion. We observed that a single condensin complex is able to extrude tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. Condensin-induced loop extrusion was strictly asymmetric, which demonstrates that condensin anchors onto DNA and reels it in from only one side. Active DNA loop extrusion by SMC complexes may provide the universal unifying principle for genome organization.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29140466": "Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show here that growing plectonemes resulting from transcription-induced supercoiling have the ability to actively push cohesin rings along chromatin fibres. The pushing direction is such that within each topologically associating domain (TAD) cohesin rings forming handcuffs move from the source of supercoiling, constituted by RNA polymerase with associated DNA topoisomerase TOP1, towards borders of TADs, where supercoiling is released by topoisomerase TOPIIB. Cohesin handcuffs are pushed by continuous flux of supercoiling that is generated by transcription and is then progressively released by action of TOPIIB located at TADs borders. Our model explains what can be the driving force of chromatin loop extrusion and how it can be ensured that loops grow quickly and in a good direction. In addition, the supercoiling-driven loop extrusion mechanism is consistent with earlier explanations proposing why TADs flanked by convergent CTCF binding sites form more stable chromatin loops than TADs flanked by divergent CTCF binding sites. We discuss the role of supercoiling in stimulating enhancer promoter contacts and propose that transcription of eRNA sends the first wave of supercoiling that can activate mRNA transcription in a given TAD.",

After loading onto chromosomes, it generates loops to regulate chromosome functions. It has been suggested that cohesin organizes the genome through loop extrusion, but direct evidence is lacking. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that the recombinant human cohesin-NIPBL complex compacts both naked and nucleosome-bound DNA by extruding DNA loops. DNA compaction by cohesin requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and is force sensitive. This compaction is processive over tens of kilobases at an average rate of 0.5 kilobases per second. Compaction of double-tethered DNA suggests that a cohesin dimer extrudes DNA loops bidirectionally. Our results establish cohesin-NIPBL as an ATP-driven molecular machine capable of loop extrusion.",

The motor function is accomplished by amino-acid motifs typical for superfamily 2 helicases, although DNA unwinding is not observed. Using a combination of extensive single-molecule magnetic tweezers and stopped-flow bulk measurements, we fully characterized the (re)initiation of DNA translocation by EcoR124I. We found that the methyltransferase core unit of the enzyme loads the motor subunits onto adjacent DNA by allowing them to bind and initiate translocation. Termination of translocation occurs owing to dissociation of the motors from the core unit. Reinitiation of translocation requires binding of new motors from solution. The identification and quantification of further initiation steps--ATP binding and extrusion of an initial DNA loop--allowed us to deduce a complete kinetic reinitiation scheme. The dissociation/reassociation of motors during translocation allows dynamic control of the restriction process by the availability of motors. Direct evidence that this control mechanism is relevant in vivo is provided.",

Recent studies in bacteria and eukaryotes have led to a unifying model in which these ring-shaped ATPases act along contiguous DNA segments, processively enlarging DNA loops. In support of this model, single-molecule imaging experiments indicate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae condensin complexes can extrude DNA loops in an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner in vitro. Here, using time-resolved high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), we investigate the interplay between ATPase activity of the Bacillus subtilis SMC complex and loop formation in vivo.

These structures depend on cohesin, a ring-shaped DNA-entrapping adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) complex that has been proposed to form loops by extrusion. Such an activity has been observed for condensin, which forms loops in mitosis, but not for cohesin. Using biochemical reconstitution, we found that single human cohesin complexes form DNA loops symmetrically at rates up to 2.1 kilo-base pairs per second. Loop formation and maintenance depend on cohesin's ATPase activity and on NIPBL-MAU2, but not on topological entrapment of DNA by cohesin. During loop formation, cohesin and NIPBL-MAU2 reside at the base of loops, which indicates that they generate loops by extrusion. Our results show that cohesin and NIPBL-MAU2 form an active holoenzyme that interacts with DNA either pseudo-topologically or non-topologically to extrude genomic interphase DNA into loops.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26574187": "Hypercapnia is clinically defined as an arterial blood partial pressure of CO2 of above 40 mmHg and is a feature of chronic lung disease. In previous studies we have demonstrated that hypercapnia modulates agonist-stimulated cAMP levels through effects on transmembrane adenylyl cyclase activity. In the airways, cAMP is known to regulate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated anion and fluid secretion, which contributes to airway surface liquid homeostasis. The aim of the current work was to investigate if hypercapnia could modulate cAMP-regulated ion and fluid transport in human airway epithelial cells. We found that acute exposure to hypercapnia significantly reduced forskolin-stimulated elevations in intracellular cAMP as well as both adenosine- and forskolin-stimulated increases in CFTR-dependent transepithelial short-circuit current, in polarised cultures of Calu-3 human airway cells. This CO2 -induced reduction in anion secretion was not due to a decrease in HCO3 (-) transport given that neither a change in CFTR-dependent HCO3 (-) efflux nor Na(+) /HCO3 (-) cotransporter-dependent HCO3 (-) influx were CO2 -sensitive. Hypercapnia also reduced the volume of forskolin-stimulated fluid secretion over 24 h, yet had no effect on the HCO3 (-) content of the secreted fluid. Our data reveal that hypercapnia reduces CFTR-dependent, electrogenic Cl(-) and fluid secretion, but not CFTR-dependent HCO3 (-) secretion, which highlights a differential sensitivity of Cl(-) and HCO3 (-) transporters to raised CO2 in Calu-3 cells. Hypercapnia also reduced forskolin-stimulated CFTR-dependent anion secretion in primary human airway epithelia. Based on current models of airways biology, a reduction in fluid secretion, associated with hypercapnia, would be predicted to have important consequences for airways hydration and the innate defence mechanisms of the lungs.",

Recent studies have shown that hypercapnia adversely affects innate immunity, host defense, lung edema clearance and cell proliferation. Airway epithelial dysfunction is a feature of advanced lung disease, but the effect of hypercapnia on airway epithelium is unknown. Thus, in the current study we examined the effect of normoxic hypercapnia (20% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 h) vs normocapnia (5% CO<sub>2</sub>), on global gene expression in differentiated normal human airway epithelial cells. Gene expression was assessed on Affymetrix microarrays, and subjected to gene ontology analysis for biological process and cluster-network representation. We found that hypercapnia downregulated the expression of 183 genes and upregulated 126. Among these, major gene clusters linked to immune responses and nucleosome assembly were largely downregulated, while lipid metabolism genes were largely upregulated. The overwhelming majority of these genes were not previously known to be regulated by CO<sub>2</sub>. These changes in gene expression indicate the potential for hypercapnia to impact bronchial epithelial cell function in ways that may contribute to poor clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute or advanced chronic lung diseases.",

We previously reported that hypercapnia inhibits the expression of TNF and IL-6 and phagocytosis in macrophages in vitro. In the present study, we determined the effects of normoxic hypercapnia (10% CO2, 21% O2, and 69% N2) on outcomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in BALB/c mice and on pulmonary neutrophil function. We found that the mortality of P. aeruginosa pneumonia was increased in 10% CO2-exposed compared with air-exposed mice. Hypercapnia increased pneumonia mortality similarly in mice with acute and chronic respiratory acidosis, indicating an effect unrelated to the degree of acidosis. Exposure to 10% CO2 increased the burden of P. aeruginosa in the lungs, spleen, and liver, but did not alter lung injury attributable to pneumonia. Hypercapnia did not reduce pulmonary neutrophil recruitment during infection, but alveolar neutrophils from 10% CO2-exposed mice phagocytosed fewer bacteria and produced less H2O2 than neutrophils from air-exposed mice. Secretion of IL-6 and TNF in the lungs of 10% CO2-exposed mice was decreased 7 hours, but not 15 hours, after the onset of pneumonia, indicating that hypercapnia inhibited the early cytokine response to infection. The increase in pneumonia mortality caused by elevated CO2 was reversible when hypercapnic mice were returned to breathing air before or immediately after infection. These results suggest that hypercapnia may increase the susceptibility to and/or worsen the outcome of lung infections in patients with severe lung disease.",

We previously reported that hypercapnia alters expression of host defense genes, inhibits phagocytosis, and increases the mortality of Pseudomonas pneumonia in mice. However, the effect of hypercapnia on autophagy, a conserved process by which cells sequester and degrade proteins and damaged organelles that also plays a key role in antimicrobial host defense and pathogen clearance, has not previously been examined. In the present study we show that hypercapnia inhibits autophagy induced by starvation, rapamycin, LPS, heat-killed bacteria, and live bacteria in the human macrophage. Inhibition of autophagy by elevated CO2 was not attributable to acidosis. Hypercapnia also reduced macrophage killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, elevated CO2 induced the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, antiapoptotic factors that negatively regulate autophagy by blocking Beclin 1, an essential component of the autophagy initiation complex. Furthermore, small interfering RNA targeting Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and the small molecule Z36, which blocks Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL binding to Beclin 1, prevented hypercapnic inhibition of autophagy and bacterial killing. These results suggest that targeting the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-Beclin 1 interaction may hold promise for ameliorating hypercapnia-induced immunosuppression and improving resistance to infection in patients with advanced lung disease and hypercapnia.",

Often, such accidents occur due to elevated inspired carbon dioxide. For instance, in cases of CO\u2082 elimination system failures during rebreather dives, elevated inspired partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO\u2082) can rapidly lead to dangerous levels of hypercapnia. Elevations in PaCO\u2082 (arterial pressure of PCO\u2082) can also occur in divers without a change in inspired PCO\u2082. In such cases, hypercapnia occurs due to alveolar hypoventilation. Several factors of the dive environment contribute to this effect through changes in minute ventilation and dead space. Predominantly, minute ventilation is reduced in diving due to changes in respiratory load and associated changes in respiratory control. Minute ventilation is further reduced by hyperoxic attenuation of chemosensitivity. Physiologic dead space is also increased due to elevated breathing gas density and to hyperoxia. The Haldane effect, a reduction in CO\u2082 solubility in blood due to hyperoxia, may contribute indirectly to hypercapnia through an increase in mixed venous PCO\u2082. In some individuals, low ventilatory response to hypercapnia may also contribute to carbon dioxide retention. This review outlines what is currently known about hypercapnia in diving, including its measurement, cause, mental and physical effects, and areas for future study.",

Hypoxia (low oxygen) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide) are co-incidental features of the tissue microenvironment in a range of pathophysiologic states, including acute and chronic respiratory diseases. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the master regulator of the transcriptional response to hypoxia; however, little is known about the impact of hypercapnia on gene transcription. Because of the relationship between hypoxia and hypercapnia, we investigated the effect of hypercapnia on the HIF pathway. Hypercapnia suppressed HIF-\u03b1 protein stability and HIF target gene expression both in mice and cultured cells in a manner that was at least in part independent of the canonical O2-dependent HIF degradation pathway. The suppressive effects of hypercapnia on HIF-\u03b1 protein stability could be mimicked by reducing intracellular pH at a constant level of partial pressure of CO2 Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase that blocks lysosomal degradation, prevented the hypercapnic suppression of HIF-\u03b1 protein. Based on these results, we hypothesize that hypercapnia counter-regulates activation of the HIF pathway by reducing intracellular pH and promoting lysosomal degradation of HIF-\u03b1 subunits. Therefore, hypercapnia may play a key role in the pathophysiology of diseases where HIF is implicated.",

Patients with hypercapnia often develop lung infections and have an increased risk of death following pneumonia. To explore whether hypercapnia interferes with host defense, we studied the effects of elevated P(CO2) on macrophage innate immune responses. In differentiated human THP-1 macrophages and human and mouse alveolar macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor ligands, hypercapnia inhibited expression of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent cytokines critical for antimicrobial host defense. Inhibition of IL-6 expression by hypercapnia was concentration dependent, rapid, reversible, and independent of extracellular and intracellular acidosis. In contrast, hypercapnia did not down-regulate IL-10 or interferon-beta, which do not require NF-kappaB. Notably, hypercapnia did not affect LPS-induced degradation of IkappaB alpha, nuclear translocation of RelA/p65, or activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, but it did block IL-6 promoter-driven luciferase activity in mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages. Elevated P(CO2) also decreased phagocytosis of opsonized polystyrene beads and heat-killed bacteria in THP-1 and human alveolar macrophages. By interfering with essential innate immune functions in the macrophage, hypercapnia may cause a previously unrecognized defect in resistance to pulmonary infection in patients with advanced lung disease.",

However, relatively little is known of the effect of hypercapnia on the electrical brain processes that underlie the BOLD response. Here, we investigate the effect of hypercapnia on resting and stimulus induced changes in neural oscillations using a feed-forward low gas flow system to deliver a reliable and repeatable level of hypercapnia. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is used in conjunction with beamformer source localisation algorithms to non-invasively image changes in oscillatory amplitude. At rest, we find robust oscillatory power loss in the alpha (8Hz-13Hz), beta (13Hz-30Hz) and low gamma (30Hz-50Hz) frequency bands in response to hypercapnia. Further, we show that the spatial signature of this power loss differs across frequency bands, with the largest effect being observed for the beta band in sensorimotor cortices. We also measure changes in oscillatory activity induced by visual and motor events, and the effect of hypercapnia on these changes; whilst the percentage change in oscillatory activity on activation was largely unaffected by hypercapnia, the absolute change in oscillatory amplitude differed between normocapnia and hypercapnia.

This gradient represents a convolution of multiple spatially separated nuclear domains including two types of transcription \"hot zones.\" Transcription hot zones protruding furthest into the nuclear interior and positioning deterministically very close to nuclear speckles have higher numbers of total genes, the most highly expressed genes, housekeeping genes, genes with low transcriptional pausing, and super-enhancers.

Patients who attended genetic clinics for testing were offered the opportunity to undergo the more extensive whole genome sequencing (WGS) if they agreed to take part in the 100 kG P. Once people had agreed, a specific additional appointment was organised for them. Taking part in the project therefore involved additional travel and appointments ('clinical labour'). We found that interviewees' decisions to participate in 100 kG P were based on interpersonal and institutional trust in the NHS, and on an investment in improving care for the future. Interviewees relied upon receiving good ongoing NHS care for managing their own or their child's rare disease, but they worried about what their relationships with NHS healthcare professionals would be like in future. A few participants worried about whether Genomics England's biorepository would remain protected and an asset of the NHS.

Although attempts at finding a nonsurgical cure date back to centuries, it is only around the middle of the last century that serious attempts at a medical treatment were carried out. Initially, both progestins and estrogen-progestin combinations have been utilized, although proof of their usefulness is lacking. A major step forward was achieved when peptide analogs of the GnRH were introduced, first those with superagonist properties and subsequently those acting as antagonists. Initially, the latter produced side effects preventing their routine utilization; eventually, this problem was overcome following the synthesis of cetrorelix. Because both types of analogs produce hypoestrogenism, their use is limited to a maximum of 6 months and, for this reason, today they are utilized as an adjuvant treatment before surgery with overall good results. Over the last decade, new, nonpeptidic, orally active GnRH-receptor blockers have also been synthesized. One of them, Elagolix, is in the early stages of testing in women with fibroids. Another fundamental development has been the utilization of the so-called selective progesterone receptor modulators, sometimes referred to as \"antiprogestins\". The first such compound to be applied to the long-term treatment of fibroids was Mifepristone; today, this compound is mostly used outside of Western Countries, where the substance of choice is Ulipristal acetate. Large clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of Ulipristal in the long-term medical therapy of fibroids, although some caution must be exercised because of the rare occurrence of liver complications. All selective progesterone receptor modulators produce unique endometrial changes that are today considered benign, reversible, and without negative consequences. In conclusion, long-term medical treatment of fibroids seems possible today, especially in premenopausal women.",

Even though often asymptomatic, UFs can worsen women's health and their quality of life, causing heavy bleeding and anaemia, pelvic discomfort and reduced fertility. Surgical treatment of UFs could be limited by its invasiveness and the desire to preserve fertility. Thus, effective medical therapies for the management of this condition are needed. Common drugs used to control bleeding, such us hormonal contraceptive or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, have no effect on fibroids volume. Among other more efficient treatments, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or the selective progesterone-receptor modulators have a non-neutral safety profile; thus, they are used for limited periods or for cyclic treatments. Elagolix is a potent, orally bioavailable, non-peptide GnRH antagonist that acts by a competitive block of the GnRH receptor. The biological effect is a dose-dependent inhibition of gonadal axis, without a total suppression of estradiol concentrations. For this reason, even though comparative studies between elagolix and GnRH agonists have not been performed, elagolix has been associated with a better profile of adverse events. Recently, elagolix received US FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe pain caused by endometriosis. Several clinical trials assessed the efficacy of elagolix for the treatment of heavy bleeding caused by UFs and the definitive results of Phase III studies are expected. Available data on elagolix and UFs showed that the drug, with or without low-dose hormone add-back therapy, is able to significantly reduce menstrual blood loss, lead to amenorrhea and improve haemoglobin concentrations in the majority of participants in comparison with placebo. The safety and tolerability profile appeared generally acceptable.

A wide range of baseline uterine and fibroid volumes and menstrual blood loss were also represented in the overall pooled study population. In all subgroups, the proportion of responders to the primary endpoint, mean change in menstrual blood loss, amenorrhea, reduction in symptom severity, and improvement in health-related quality of life were clinically meaningfully greater for women who received elagolix with add-back therapy than those who received placebo and consistent with the overall pooled study population for the primary endpoint (72.2% vs 9.3%), mean change in menstrual blood loss (-172.5 mL vs -0.8 mL), amenorrhea (50.4% vs 4.5%), symptom severity (-37.1 vs -9.2), and health-related quality of life score (39.9 vs 8.9). Adverse events by subgroup were consistent with the overall pooled study population. Elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy was effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids independent of age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume.",

The objective was to evaluate the effects of elagolix on ovulation and ovarian sex hormones. This was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Participants were healthy ovulatory women aged 18 to 40 years. Elagolix was administered orally for 3 continuous 28-day dosing intervals at 100 to 200 mg once daily (QD), 100 to 300 mg twice daily (BID), and 300 mg BID plus estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) 1/0.5 mg QD. The main outcomes measures were ovulation rates measured by transvaginal ultrasound, progesterone concentrations, and hormone suppression. Elagolix suppressed ovulation in a dose-dependent manner. The percentage of women who ovulated was highest at 100 mg QD (78%), intermediate at 150 and 200 mg QD and 100 mg BID (47%-57%), and lowest at 200 and 300 mg BID (32% and 27%, respectively). Addition of E2/NETA to elagolix 300 mg BID further suppressed the ovulation rate to 10%. Elagolix also suppressed luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in a dose-dependent manner, leading to dose-dependent suppression of estradiol and progesterone. Elagolix had no effect on serum biomarker of ovarian reserve, and reduced endometrial thickness compared to the screening cycle. Women being treated with elagolix may ovulate and should use effective methods of contraception. The rate of ovulation was lowest with elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA 1/0.5 mg QD.",

Based on the in vitro profile of elagolix metabolism and disposition, 9 drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies evaluating the victim and perpetrator characteristics of elagolix were conducted in 144 healthy volunteers. As a victim of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and transporter-mediated DDIs, elagolix area under the curve (AUC) increased by \u223c2-fold following coadministration with ketoconazole and by \u223c5- and \u223c2-fold with single and multiple doses of rifampin, respectively. As a perpetrator, elagolix decreased midazolam AUC (90% confidence interval) by 54% (50%-59%) and increased digoxin AUC by 32% (23%-41%). Elagolix decreased rosuvastatin AUC by 40% (29%-50%). No clinically significant changes in exposure on coadministration with sertraline or fluconazole occurred. A elagolix 150-mg once-daily regimen should be limited to 6 months with strong CYP3A inhibitors and rifampin because of the potential increase in bone mineral density loss, as described in the drug label. A 200-mg twice-daily regimen is recommended for no more than 1 month with strong CYP3A inhibitors and not recommended with rifampin.

Previous studies have shown that mitochondria play key roles in apoptosis, but the role of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) copy number in the pathogenesis of hair cell apoptosis remains largely unknown. We used mouse cochlear hair cells and House Ear Institute\u2011Organ of Corti 1 (HEI\u2011OC1) cells to explore the relationship between mtDNA copy number and cell apoptosis. We found that the mtDNA copy number of hair cells was reduced relative to mitochondrial mass and hypothesized that increasing it might have a protective effect. We then increased the mtDNA copy number of the hair and HEI\u2011OC1 cells by transfecting them with an adeno\u2011associated virus (AAV) vector containing mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). We found that the apoptosis rates decreased upon inducing apoptosis with neomycin or cisplatin (DDP). To elucidate the mechanisms, we analyzed the mitochondrial\u2011membrane permeability and mitochondrial function of HEI\u2011OC1 cells. Our results suggested that the increase in mtDNA copy number could protect hair cells and HEI\u2011OC1 cells against drug\u2011induced apoptosis by stabilizing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and mitochondrial function.",

Three detailed finite element (FE) models of the cochlear short section (CSS) are studied. In model 1, the CSS is without fluids; model 2 includes the OoC fluid, but not the exterior scalae fluids; and model 3 is the CSS with both scalae and OoC fluids. We find that: (1) the fundamental mode shape of models 1 or 3 is similar to the classical basilar membrane (BM) bending mode that includes pivoting of the arch of corti, and hence determines the low frequency vibrational mode shape of the cochlea in the presence of the cochlear wave. (2) The fundamental mode shape of model 2 is characterized by a cross-sectional shape change similar to the passive response of the cochlea. This mode shape includes a tilting motion of the inner hair cell (IHC) region, a fluid motion within the tunnel of corti (ToC) in the radial direction and along the OoC, and a bulging motion of the reticular lamina (RL) above the outer hair cell (OHC). Each of these motions provides a plausible mode of excitation of the sensory hair cells. (3) The higher vibrational modes of model 1 are similar to the electrically evoked response within the OoC and suggests that the higher vibrational modes are responsible for the active response of the cochlea. We also observed that the fluid flow through the OoC interstitial space is significant, and the model comparison suggests that the OoC fluid contributes to the biphasic BM motion seen in electrical stimulation experiments. The effect of fluid viscosity on cilium deflection was assessed by performing a transient analysis to calculate the cilium shearing gain. The gain values are found to be within the range of experimentally measured values reported by Dallos et al. (1996, The Cochlea, Springer-Verlag, New York).",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579963": "High sensitivity and selectivity of hearing require an active cochlea. The cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, vibrates because of external and internal excitations. The external stimulation is acoustic pressures mediated by the scala fluids, whereas the internal excitation is generated by a type of sensory receptor cells (the outer hair cells) in response to the acoustic vibrations. The outer hair cells are cellular actuators that are responsible for cochlear amplification. The organ of Corti is highly structured for transmitting vibrations originating from acoustic pressure and active outer hair cell force to the inner hair cells that synapse on afferent nerves. Understanding how the organ of Corti vibrates because of acoustic pressure and outer hair cell force is critical for explaining cochlear function. In this study, cochleae were freshly isolated from young gerbils. The organ of Corti in the excised cochlea was subjected to mechanical and electrical stimulation that are analogous to acoustic and cellular stimulation in the natural cochlea. Organ of Corti vibrations, including those of individual outer hair cells, were measured using optical coherence tomography. Respective vibration patterns due to mechanical and electrical stimulation were characterized. Interactions between the two vibration patterns were investigated by applying the two forms of stimulation simultaneously. Our results show that the interactions could be either constructive or destructive, which implies that the outer hair cells can either amplify or reduce vibrations in the organ of Corti. We discuss a potential consequence of the two interaction modes for cochlear frequency tuning.",

Seventy-seven patients were included, of which 65 (85.5%) were identified by routine screening. Median age at the end of the follow-up was 10 years (minimum 2, maximum 25). Retinochoroiditis was present in 55 patients (71.4%). New retinochoroidal lesions developed after the first year of life in 77.8% of the patients who began treatment after the fourth month of life, compared with 35.2% among those treated before 4 months of life (relative risk = 0.45, 95% confidence intervals: 0.27-0.75, P = 0.02) and 33.3% among those treated before 2 months of life (relative risk = 0.42, 95% confidence intervals: 0.25-0.72, P = 0.01). There was a peak incidence of new retinochoroidal lesions between 4 and 5 years and another peak between 9 and 14 years, the latter only among girls. Thirty-four patients with retinochoroiditis were followed up for 10 years or more, and the school performance was appropriate in 28 (82.4%). The high incidence of new retinochoroidal lesions during the follow-up period indicates the importance of long-term follow-up of patients with congenital toxoplasmosis. Initiating treatment within the first 4 months of life, especially within the first 2 months, was a protective factor against the later development of retinochoroiditis.

Four hundred and thirty consecutive children with serologically confirmed congenital toxoplasmosis were included in this study. Data were prospectively collected using standardized ophthalmological assessment forms. The presence of retinochoroiditis and of associated pathologies was ascertained, and their impact on visual function was assessed. After a median follow-up of 12 years [range 0.6-26 years], 130 children manifested retinochoroiditis. We detected 22 foci of retinochoroiditis at birth and 264 additional ones during the follow-up period. Of these, 48 (17%) were active when first diagnosed. Twenty-five of the 130 children (19%) had other associated ocular pathologies. Of these, 21 (16%) had a strabismus, which was due to macular lesions in 86% of the cases; 7 (5.4%) presented with unilateral microphthalmia, and 4 (3%) with cataracts. Most of these events were detected after the onset of retinochoroiditis. None of the children presented with ocular involvement in the absence of chorioretinal lesions.

Associated eye pathologies were manifested less frequently than anticipated. They may occur later in life and are an indirect marker of the severity of congenital toxoplasmosis, but they do not have a direct impact on visual acuity.

Recent work in nematodes has demonstrated that the identity of genes within operons is highly conserved among species and that the unifying feature of genes within operons is that they are expressed in germline tissue. However, it is generally unknown what processes are responsible for generating the distribution of operon sizes across the genome, which are composed of up to eight genes per operon. Here we investigate several models for operon evolution to better understand their abundance, distribution of sizes, and evolutionary dynamics over time. We find that birth-death models of operon evolution reasonably describe the relative abundance of operons of different sizes in the C. elegans and Ciona genomes and generate predictions about the number of monocistronic, nonoperon genes that likely participate in the birth-death process. This theory, and applications to C. elegans and Ciona, motivates several new and testable hypotheses about eukaryote operon evolution.",

Operons are present in the class Chromadorea, one of the two main nematode classes, but their distribution in the other class, the Enoplea, is not known. We have surveyed the genomes of Trichinella spiralis, Trichuris muris, and Romanomermis culicivorax and identified the first putative operons in members of the Enoplea. Consistent with the mechanism of polycistronic RNA resolution in other nematodes, the mRNAs produced by genes downstream of the first gene in the T. spiralis and T. muris operons are trans-spliced to spliced leader RNAs, and we are able to detect polycistronic RNAs derived from these operons. Importantly, a putative intercistronic region from one of these potential enoplean operons confers polycistronic processing activity when expressed as part of a chimeric operon in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that T. spiralis genes located in operons have an increased likelihood of having operonic C. elegans homologs. However, operon structure in terms of synteny and gene content is not tightly conserved between the two taxa, consistent with models of operon evolution. We have nevertheless identified putative operons conserved between Enoplea and Chromadorea. Our data suggest that operons and \"spliced leader\" (SL) trans-splicing predate the radiation of the nematode phylum, an inference which is supported by the phylogenetic profile of proteins known to be involved in nematode SL trans-splicing.",

A mode of genetic regulation that involves insulators and insulator binding proteins to establish independent transcriptional units is currently not known in nematodes including Caenorhabditis elegans. We therefore searched in nematodes for orthologs of proteins that are involved in chromatin insulation. While orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all 35 analysed nematode species, we find orthologs of CTCF in a subset of nematodes. As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans and other derived nematodes does so. Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes, seemingly adopted their function.",

It is unclear how operons have become abundant in nematode genomes. The \"one-way street\" hypothesis asserts that once formed by chance, operons are very difficult to break, because the breakage would leave downstream genes in an operon without a promoter, and hence, unexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C. elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as outgroups, and identified numerous operon gains and losses. Coupled with experimental examination of trans-splicing patterns, our comparative genomic analysis revealed diverse molecular mechanisms of operon losses, including inversion, insertion, and relocation, but the presence of internal promoters was not found to facilitate operon losses. In several cases, the data allowed inference of mechanisms by which downstream genes are expressed after operon breakage. We found that the rate of operon gain is approximately 3.3 times that of operon loss. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of nematode operons is better described as \"easy come, slow go,\" rather than a \"one-way street.\" Based on a mathematic model of operon gains and losses and additional assumptions, we projected that the number of operons in C. elegans will continue to rise by 6%-18% in future evolution before reaching equilibrium between operon gains and losses.",

By using a combination of RT-PCR and ChIP analysis we found that pol II generally transcribes up to 1 kb past the poly(A) sites into the 3' flanking regions of the nematode genes before it terminates. We also show that pol II does not terminate after transcription of internal poly(A) sites in operons.

Experimental techniques suitable for characterizing PPIs (X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, among others) are usually laborious, time-consuming and often difficult to apply to membrane proteins, and therefore require accurate prediction of the candidate interacting partners. High-throughput experimental methods (yeast two-hybrid and affinity purification) succumb to the same shortcomings, and can also lead to high rates of false positive and negative results. Therefore, reliable tools for predicting PPIs are needed. The use of the operon structure in the eukaryote Caenorhabditis elegans genome is a valuable, though underserved, tool for identifying physically or functionally interacting proteins. Based on the concept that genes organized in the same operon may encode physically or functionally related proteins, this algorithm is easy to be applied and, importantly, gives a limited number of candidate partners of a given protein, allowing for focused experimental verification.

We have produced transgenic strains carrying fusions between gfp and a number of genes from the operon. These constructs show complex differential expression patterns that suggest the presence of internal promoters and regulatory sequences in the operon. This organization would permit both coordinated expression and differential expression of the components of the CEOP2232 operon. The heterogeneity of the genes, and their complex expression patterns, suggests that the clustering of CEOP2232 is not due to a need for synchronized expression of genes involved in the same physiological pathway.",

However, new research indicates that operons are found in higher organisms as well. There are instances of operons found in C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and other eukaryotic species. We developed a prototype using positional, structural and gene expression information to identify candidate operons. We focused our efforts on \"trans-spliced\" operons in which the pre-mRNA is trans-spliced into individual transcripts and subsequently translated, as widely observed in C. elegans and some instances in Drosophila. We identify several candidate operons in Drosophila melanogaster of which two have been subsequently molecularly validated.",

Operons are regulated multigene transcription units, in which polycistronic pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA coding for multiple peptides) is processed to monocistronic mRNAs. This occurs by 3' end formation and trans-splicing using the specialized SL2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle for downstream mRNAs. Previously, the correlation between downstream location in an operon and SL2 trans-splicing has been strong, but anecdotal. Although only 28 operons have been reported, the complete sequence of the C. elegans genome reveals numerous gene clusters. To determine how many of these clusters represent operons, we probed full-genome microarrays for SL2-containing mRNAs. We found significant enrichment for about 1,200 genes, including most of a group of several hundred genes represented by complementary DNAs that contain SL2 sequence. Analysis of their genomic arrangements indicates that &gt;90% are downstream genes, falling in 790 distinct operons. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes. Numerous examples of co-transcription of genes encoding functionally related proteins are evident. Inspection of the operon list should reveal previously unknown functional relationships.",

Accurate detection of TSSs enhances identification and discovery of core promoters. In addition, active enhancers can be detected through signatures of bidirectional transcription initiation. Described here is a protocol for performing super-low input carrier-CAGE (SLIC-CAGE). This SLIC adaptation of the CAGE protocol minimizes RNA losses by artificially increasing the RNA amount through use of an in vitro transcribed RNA carrier mix that is added to the sample of interest, thus enabling library preparation from nanogram-amounts of total RNA (i.e., thousands of cells). The carrier mimics the expected DNA library fragment length distribution, thereby eliminating biases that could be caused by the abundance of a homogenous carrier. In the last stages of the protocol, the carrier is removed through degradation with homing endonucleases and the target library is amplified. The target sample library is protected from degradation, as the homing endonuclease recognition sites are long (between 18 and 27 bp), making the probability of their existence in the eukaryotic genomes very low. The end result is a DNA library ready for next-generation sequencing. All steps in the protocol, up to sequencing, can be completed within 6 days. The carrier preparation requires a full working day; however, it can be prepared in large quantities and kept frozen at -80 \u00b0C. Once sequenced, the reads can be processed to obtain genome-wide single-nucleotide resolution TSSs. TSSs can be used for core promoter or enhancer discovery, providing insight into gene regulation. Once aggregated to promoters, the data can also be used for 5'-centric expression profiling.",

The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 \u00b5g), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. We demonstrate the ability of SLIC-CAGE to generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods, by generating a complex, high-quality library from mouse embryonic day 11.5 primordial germ cells.",

Hypofractionated RT and re-irradiation at first progression have gained popularity in improving the quality of life of such patients. We performed a retrospective review of children with DIPG treated at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center from 2000 to 2018. A total of 24 cases were reviewed. Median age at diagnosis was 6.3 years (1.6-14.0). Twenty patients received RT only once. Thirteen patients received conventionally fractionated RT, and seven patients received hypofractionated RT as up-front RT. Severe toxicities were not observed in patients who received hypofractionated RT. Median OS and time to progression were similar between conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated RT groups.(9.7 [95% confidence interval(CI): 7.1-11.2] versus 11.0[95% CI: 5.2-13.6] months, P = 0.60; 4.2[95% CI: 1.8-8.3] versus 7.1 [95% CI:4.5-8.7] months, P = 0.38).

No other treatment was applied concomitantly. Fourteen of the 22 patients received the prescribed dose of 45 Gy in 15 fractions of 3 Gy, and 2 patients received a total dose of 60 and 45 Gy with a combination of two different beams (photons and neutrons). In five cases the daily fraction was modified to 2 Gy due to intolerance, and one patient died due to serious intracranial hypertension after two fractions of 3 Gy and one of 2 Gy.

No treatment interruption was needed. In six patients, steroids could be discontinued within 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. Median time to progression and median overall survival were 5.7 months and 7.6 months, respectively. External radiotherapy with a radical hypofractionated regimen is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.

Therefore it has been assumed that STARD10 may function in the secretion of phospholipids into the bile. To help elucidate the physiological role of STARD10, we produced Stard10 knockout mice (Stard10(-/-)) and studied their phenotype. Neither liver content nor biliary secretion of phosphatidylcholine was altered in Stard10(-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, the biliary secretion of bile acids from the liver and the level of taurine-conjugated bile acids in the bile were significantly higher in Stard10(-/-) mice than wild type (WT) mice. In contrast, the levels of the secondary bile acids were lower in the liver of Stard10(-/-) mice, suggesting that the enterohepatic cycling is impaired. STARD10 was also expressed in the gallbladder and small intestine where the expression level of apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) turned out to be markedly lower in Stard10(-/-) mice than in WT mice when measured under fed condition. Consistent with the above results, the fecal excretion of bile acids was significantly increased in Stard10(-/-) mice. Interestingly, PPAR\u03b1-dependent genes responsible for the regulation of bile acid metabolism were down-regulated in the liver of Stard10(-/-) mice. The loss of STARD10 impaired the PPAR\u03b1 activity and the expression of a PPAR\u03b1-target gene such as Cyp8b1 in mouse hepatoma cells. These results indicate that STARD10 is involved in regulating bile acid metabolism through the modulation of PPAR\u03b1-mediated mechanism.",

We now provide evidence that StarD10 interacts with phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by electron spin resonance measurement. Interaction with these phospholipids was verified in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay with 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-labeled lipids. Binding was not restricted to lipid analogs since StarD10 selectively extracted PC and PE from small unilamellar vesicles prepared with endogenous radiolabeled lipids from Vero monkey kidney cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that StarD10 preferentially selects lipid species containing a palmitoyl or stearoyl chain on the sn-1 and an unsaturated fatty acyl chain (18:1 or 18:2) on the sn-2 position. StarD10 was further shown to bind lipids in vivo by cross-linking of protein expressed in transfected HEK-293T cells with photoactivable phosphatidylcholine. In addition to a lipid binding function, StarD10 transferred PC and PE between membranes.

Recent studies show that the C-terminal end of the domain plays a fundamental role, forming a lid over a deep lipid-binding pocket that shields the ligand from the external environment. The START domain can be regarded as a lipid-exchange and/or a lipid-sensing domain. Mammalian START proteins have diverse expression patterns and can be found free in the cytoplasm, attached to membranes or in the nucleus. They appear to function in a variety of distinct physiological processes, such as lipid transfer between intracellular compartments, lipid metabolism and modulation of signaling events.

The disease firstly involves premature aging and then death from complications of atherosclerosis such as myocardial infarction, stroke, atherosclerosis, or heart failure. The lifespan of the patient is normally up to teen age or early twenties. It is usually not inherited because a patient normally dies before the age of reproduction. The most important genetic linkage between progeria and aging is shortening of telomere ends with each replication cycle. The patients are normally observed to have extremely short telomeres. Currently, 90% of the patients are said to have de novo point mutations in the LMNA gene that substitute cytosine with thymine and have been found in individuals with HGPS. Lmna encodes lamins A and C, and the A-type lamins have important structural function in the nuclear envelope. The most common type of HGPS mutation is located at codon 608 (G608G).

Cardiovascular compromise leads to early demise. Cognitive development is normal. Data on 10 of our own cases and 132 cases from literature are presented. The incidence in the last century in the Netherlands was 1:4,000,000. Sex ratio was 1.2:1. Main first symptoms were failure to thrive (55%), hair loss (40%), skin problems (28%), and lipodystrophy (20%). Mean age at diagnosis was 2.9 years. Growth in weight was more disturbed than growth in height, and growth delay started already prenatally. Mean height &gt; 13 years was 109.0 cm, mean weight was 14.5 kg. Osteolysis was wide-spread but not expressed, except in the viscerocranium, and remained limited to membranous formed bone. Lipodystrophy is generalized, only intra-abdominal fat depositions remain present. Cardiovascular problems are extremely variable, both in age of onset and nature. Stroke and coronary dysfunctioning are most frequent. Pathologic findings in coronaries and aorta resemble sometimes the findings in elderly persons, but can also be much more limited. Loss of smooth muscle cells seems the most important finding. Mean age of demise was 12.6 years. Patients can be subdivided in patients with classical HGPS, which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, (almost) all cases representing spontaneous mutations, and in non-classical progeria, in whom growth can be less retarded, scalp hair remains present for a longer time, lipodystrophy is more slowly progressive, osteolysis is more expressed except in the face, and survival well into adulthood is not uncommon. Pattern of inheritance of non-classical progeria is most probably autosomal recessive. The cause of HGPS is an abnormally formed Lamin A, either directly by a mutated LMNA gene, or through abnormal posttranslational processing (ZMPSTE24 gene mutations). Of 34 LMNA mutations found in progeria patients, there were 26 classical p.G608G mutations (76%). Pathogenesis is most likely to follow several different pathways.

However, these nuclear abnormalities in APS patients could not be rescued with 48 h treatment with farnesyl transferase inhibitors, geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors or trichostatin-A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Immunoblots of cell lysates from fibroblasts did not reveal prelamin A accumulation in any of these patients. APS patients have a few overlapping but some distinct clinical features as compared with HGPS and mandibuloacral dysplasia. The pathogenesis of clinical manifestations in APS patients seems not to be related to accumulation of mutant farnesylated prelamin A.",

The G608G mutation generates a more accessible splicing donor site than does WT and produces an alternatively spliced product of LMNA called progerin, which is also expressed in normal aged cells. In this study, we determined that progerin binds directly to lamin A/C and induces profound nuclear aberrations. Given this observation, we performed a random screening of a chemical library and identified 3 compounds (JH1, JH4, and JH13) that efficiently block progerin-lamin A/C binding. These 3 chemicals, particularly JH4, alleviated nuclear deformation and reversed senescence markers characteristic of HGPS cells, including growth arrest and senescence-associated \u03b2-gal (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity. We then used microarray-based analysis to demonstrate that JH4 is able to rescue defects of cell-cycle progression in both HGPS and aged cells. Furthermore, administration of JH4 to LmnaG609G/G609G-mutant mice, which phenocopy human HGPS, resulted in a marked improvement of several progeria phenotypes and an extended lifespan. Together, these findings indicate that specific inhibitors with the ability to block pathological progerin-lamin A/C binding may represent a promising strategy for improving lifespan and health in both HGPS and normal aging.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22540283": " The pharmacokinetic models that are applied to describe the disposition of therapeutic antibodies assume that the interaction between an antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. However, an increasing number of therapeutic antibodies are directed towards soluble/mobile targets. A flawed conclusion can be reached if the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis assumes that the interaction between the therapeutic antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. The objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of local versus systemic interactions between adalimumab and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), identify localization of the site of adalimumab action and assess the efficacy of local (intra-articular) versus systemic adalimumab administration for treatment of RA. The clinical and preclinical data on adalimumab and TNF\u03b1 disposition were analysed using a pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation approach. The disposition of adalimumab and TNF\u03b1 and the interaction between them at the individual compartments (the synovial fluid of the affected joints, central and peripheral compartments) following different routes of adalimumab administration were studied. Outcomes of modelling and simulation using the pharmacokinetic model developed indicate that adalimumab can efficiently permeate from the diseased joints to the central circulation in RA patients. Permeability of TNF\u03b1, which is excessively secreted in the joints, is even higher than that of adalimumab. As a result, subcutaneous, intravenous and intra-articular administration of the clinically used dose of adalimumab (40 mg) exert similar effects on the time course of TNF\u03b1 concentrations at different locations in the body and efficiently deplete the TNF\u03b1 in all of the compartments for a prolonged period of time (8-10 weeks). At this dose, adalimumab exhibits predominantly systemic anti-TNF\u03b1 effects at the central and peripheral compartments (\u223c93% of the overall effect) and the contribution of the local effects in the rheumatic joints is \u223c7% for all of the studied routes, including the local intra-articular injections. The major pathway of TNF\u03b1 elimination from the synovial fluid (\u223c77% for subcutaneous administration, and \u223c72% for intravenous and intra-articular administration of adalimumab 40 mg) is interaction with adalimumab, which reaches the joints following local or systemic administration. The kinetics of adalimumab permeation to the synovial fluid (0.00422 L/h clearance of permeation) versus the rate of TNF\u03b1 turnover in the affected joints (1.84 pmol/h synthesis rate and 0.877 h(-1) degradation rate constant) are apparently the major parameters that determine the time course of TNF\u03b1 concentrations in the synovial fluid and the TNF\u03b1-neutralizing effects of adalimumab in RA patients. Outcomes of this study suggest that intra-articular administration of adalimumab is not preferable to subcutaneous or intravenous treatment. Local and systemic permeability, turnover and interactions between the drug and the target should be taken into account for optimization of the use of drugs acting on soluble targets (growth factors, interferons, interleukins, immunoglobulins, etc.).",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24774505": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). TNF inhibition results in down-regulation of abnormal and progressive inflammatory processes, resulting in rapid and sustained clinical remission, improved quality of life and prevention of target organ damage. Adalimumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against TNF. In this article, we review the role and cost effectiveness of adalimumab in the treatment of IMIDs in adults and children. The efficacy and tolerability of adalimumab has been demonstrated in patients with a wide range of inflammatory conditions, leading to regulatory approval in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), plaque psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, paediatric Crohn's disease, and intestinal Beh\u00e7et's disease), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The major tolerability issues with adalimumab are class effects, such as injection site reactions and increased risk of infection and lymphoma. As with all anti-TNF agents, adalimumab is immunogenic, although less than infliximab, and some patients receiving long-term adalimumab will develop anti-drug antibodies, causing a loss of response. Comparisons of its clinical utility and cost effectiveness have shown it to be a valid treatment choice in a wide range of patients. Recent data from Italian economic studies show the cost effectiveness of adalimumab to be below the threshold value for health care interventions for most indications. In addition, analysis of indirect costs shows that adalimumab significantly reduces social costs associated with RA, PsA, AS, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. The fact that adalimumab has the widest range of approved indications, many often presenting together in the same patient due to the common pathogenesis, may further improve the utility of adalimumab. Current clinical evidence shows adalimumab to be a valuable resource in the management of IMIDs. Further research, designed to identify patients who may benefit most from this drug, will better highlight the role and cost-effectiveness of this versatile TNF inhibitor.",

By interrogating 2 Italian registries, LORHEN and GISEA, we analysed the efficacy of ADA in first- or second-line in a total of 2262 RA patients. Patients in 1st line were significantly older, with lower disease activity and HAQ scores compared to 2nd line. In 1st line, rates of DAS28-remission (DAS28rem) at 2 years were 34.4% while 26.5% in 2nd line (p=0.038). A normal HAQ score (HAQ\u22640.5) was achieved in 53.5% after 2 years in 1st line versus 30.1% in 2nd (p&lt;0.0001).

We aimed to analyse changes in the skin inflammatory transcriptomic profile in psoriatic patients during adalimumab therapy. In addition, the circulating cytokine profile was analysed to define systemic inflammation. Eighteen patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were treated with adalimumab. After four and 16 weeks, clinical efficacy was assessed using PASI and DLQI, and skin mRNA profiles were determined and circulating cytokines quantified. We identified a rapid effect of adalimumab therapy on a large array of Th17 cytokines of the skin, which may account for the modification of keratinocyte expression profile and clinical response. In contrast, analysis of serum cytokine concentrations was uninformative, confirming the need for characterization of local cytokines in skin lesions. Finally, in non-responders, local cytokine expression was shown to be unchanged.

Both mAbs and the soluble TNF receptor demonstrated low-level binding to the activating receptors FcgammaRI, FcgammaRIIa, and FcgammaRIIIa, and the inhibitory receptor FcgammaRIIb, in the absence of exogenous TNF. However, upon addition of TNF, the mAbs, but not etanercept, showed significantly increased binding, in particular to the FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII receptors. Infliximab and adalimumab induced ADCC much more potently than etanercept. In the presence of TNF, both mAbs bound C1q in in vitro assays, but etanercept did not bind C1q under any conditions.

These include studies comparing CAR T-cell therapy to autologous stem cell transplantation or investigating their use at earlier stages of disease, novel combinations, and novel constructs. Here we provide a thorough review on the use of the anti-CD19 CAR T-cell products axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel in patients with indolent or aggressive B-cell lymphoma or with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and present novel CAR T cell-based approaches currently under investigation in these disease settings.",

The aim of this review is to give an overview of the pivotal phase I/II trials, emerging real-world evidence and ongoing trials. For decades, attempts at improvement of the poor prognosis of patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma with new treatment regimens have been disappointing. Since the first report of CD19-directed CAR-T-cell therapy in 2010, three constructs have been tested in large phase I/II trials and resulted in 30-40% durable responses. This has led to Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approval for axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel and filing of the biologics license application for lisocabtagene maraleucel. Emerging real-world evidence seems to confirm the promising results. However, considerable toxicity, mainly cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity limits their general applicability and not all patients intended to be treated can be bridged during the manufacturing period due to kinetics of the disease. Randomized phase III clinical trials are being conducted to test anti-CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy in the second-line and several phase II trials are aiming to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity. CD19-directed CAR-T-cell therapy has become standard of care for aggressive R/R diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL), but challenges still remain.",

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas. We did a seamless design study at 14 cancer centres in the USA. We enrolled adult patients (aged \u226518 years) with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas. Eligible histological subgroups included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangements of MYC and either BCL2, BCL6, or both (double-hit or triple-hit lymphoma), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma transformed from any indolent lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B. Patients were assigned to one of three target dose levels of liso-cel as they were sequentially tested in the trial (50 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells [one or two doses], 100 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells, and 150 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells), which were administered as a sequential infusion of two components (CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells) at equal target doses. Primary endpoints were adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, and the objective response rate (assessed per Lugano criteria); endpoints were assessed by an independent review committee in the efficacy-evaluable set (comprising all patients who had confirmed PET-positive disease and received at least one dose of liso-cel). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02631044\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02631044</a>. Between Jan 11, 2016, and July 5, 2019, 344 patients underwent leukapheresis for manufacture of CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells (liso-cel), of whom 269 patients received at least one dose of liso-cel. Patients had received a median of three (range 1-8) previous lines of systemic treatment, with 260 (97%) patients having had at least two lines. 112 (42%) patients were aged 65 years or older, 181 (67%) had chemotherapy-refractory disease, and seven (3%) had secondary CNS involvement. Median follow-up for overall survival for all 344 patients who had leukapheresis was 18\u00b78 months (95% CI 15\u00b70-19\u00b73). Overall safety and activity of liso-cel did not differ by dose level. The recommended target dose was 100 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells (50 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> and 50 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells). Of 256 patients included in the efficacy-evaluable set, an objective response was achieved by 186 (73%, 95% CI 66\u00b78-78\u00b70) patients and a complete response by 136 (53%, 46\u00b78-59\u00b74). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia in 161 (60%) patients, anaemia in 101 (37%), and thrombocytopenia in 72 (27%). Cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in 113 (42%) and 80 (30%) patients, respectively; grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in six (2%) and 27 (10%) patients, respectively. Nine (6%) patients had a dose-limiting toxicity, including one patient who died from diffuse alveolar damage following a dose of 50 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells. Use of liso-cel resulted in a high objective response rate, with a low incidence of grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome and neurological events in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas, including those with diverse histological subtypes and high-risk features.

Differences among these products include the specific CAR constructs, costimulatory domains, manufacturing process, dose, and eligibility criteria for their pivotal trials. Notable toxicities include cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, which are usually treatable and reversible, as well as cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia. Incidences of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity differ across CAR T-cell products, related in part to the type of costimulatory domain. Potential mechanisms of resistance include CAR T-cell exhaustion and immune evasion, CD19 antigen loss, and a lack of persistence. Rational combination strategies with CAR T cells are under evaluation, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulators, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Novel cell products are also being developed and include CAR T cells that target multiple tumor antigens, cytokine-secreting CAR T cells, and gene-edited CAR T cells, among others.",

However, whether combining acupotomy with ASCs will reverse cartilage degeneration by promoting chondrocyte proliferation in KOA rabbits is unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of combination therapy of acupotomy and ASCs on chondrocyte proliferation and to determine the underlying mechanism in rabbits with KOA induced by knee joint immobilization for 6 weeks. After KOA modeling, five groups of rabbits (acupotomy, ASCs, acupotomy + ASCs, model and control groups) received the indicated intervention for 4 weeks. The combination therapy significantly restored the KOA-induced decrease in passive range of motion (PROM) in the knee joint and reduced the elevated serum level of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a marker for cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the combination therapy inhibited cartilage injury. The combination therapy also significantly blocked increases in the mRNA and protein expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and decreases in the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1/CDK4 and cyclin D1/CDK6 in cartilage. These findings indicated that the combination therapy mitigated knee joint immobility, promoted chondrocyte proliferation and alleviated cartilage degeneration in KOA rabbits, and these effects may be mediated by specifically regulating the GSK3\u03b2-cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 pathway.",

Male Sprague Dawley rats (<i>n</i> = 32) were randomly divided into four groups: control, TrP, acupotomy, and lidocaine injection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure AChE, and free sarcoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were determined by fluorescent staining with Fura-2 AM; high-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure ATP and AMP, and SP and CGRP were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Compared with the control group, free sarcoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, AMP, SP, and CGRP were higher in the model group, while MPT, AChE, and ATP were lower. Treatment with acupotomy or lidocaine injection reduced free sarcoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, SP, and CGRP and increased MPTs and AChE levels compared with the model group. However, only acupotomy also led to decreased AMP and increased ATP levels relative to the model group. We conclude that acupotomy can alleviate energy crises at TrPs.",

All except the normal group were comprised of animal models of third lumbar vertebral transverse foramen syndrome prepared by embedding sponge in the left third lumbar transverse process. The rabbits in the acupotomy and EA groups underwent bilateral acupotomylysis intervention; those in the acupotomy-EA group underwent acupotomylysis and EA interventions. On the 28th day after modeling, the double-antibody ELISA was used to detect b-FGF and CD34 levels in the serum and homogenates of a muscle tissue sample from the left side of the third lumbar transverse process. The b-FGF levels in local muscle homogenates were significantly higher in the modeled rabbits than in the normal rabbits (P &lt; 0.01), and the CD34 levels in the modeled group were significantly lower than in the normal group (P &lt; 0.01).

The observation group was made up of 70 patients, including 30 males and 40 females; the mean age was (59.2\u00b111.5) years old; the mean duration of disease was (6.76\u00b14.14) months; the observed patients were treated with acupotomy-injection technique with targeted three-point. There were also 70 patients in the control group, made up of 29 males and 41 females; the mean age was (58.9\u00b111.8) years old; the mean duration of disease was (6.65\u00b13.98) months; the control group was treated with the small needle knife therapy. Before treatment and one month after the treatment, the pain levels of both groups were assessed using the short-form McGill pain questionnaire, and the shoulder function was evaluated using the Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome Scoring. The clinical efficacy of between groups was compared after treatment, and finally, the improvement rate of pain degree was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the patients. The PRI, VAS, PPI and total pain scores of frozen shoulder patients in both groups decreased significantly one month after the treatment compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Compared with the control group, the observation group exhibited a more significant decrease in pain scores (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the shoulder pain, muscle strength, ADL, ROM and total function scores of frozen shoulder patients in the two groups were significantly improved one month after the treatment compared with those before treatment(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The inter-group comparison indicated that the pain, ADL, ROM and total function scores were improved obviously in the observation group when compared to those in the control group(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), but no remarkable difference was found between muscle strength score and the control group(<i>P</i>&gt;0.05).

We have combined biochemical purification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator from chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal Mediator occupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically with Mediator on the chromatin template. Tandem mass spectrometry of proteins in immunoprecipitates of mediator complexes revealed specific interactions between Mediator and the RSC, Arp2/Arp3, CPF, CF 1A and Lsm complexes in chromatin. These factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly, mRNA 3'-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been shown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we have found that Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries, such as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4. This suggests that Mediator plays a significant role in higher-order genome organization.",

It mediates sister chromatid cohesion, which is essential for chromosome segregation and homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair. Together with architectural proteins and transcriptional regulators, such as CTCF and Mediator, respectively, it contributes to genome organization at different scales and thereby affects transcription, DNA replication, and locus rearrangement. Although cohesin is essential for cell viability, partial loss of function can affect these processes differently in distinct cell types. Mutations in genes encoding cohesin subunits and regulators of the complex have been identified in several cancers. Understanding the functional significance of these alterations may have relevant implications for patient classification, risk prediction, and choice of treatment.

Conditional inactivation and ectopic tethering experiments support a direct role for the TFs Gcn4 and Nup2 in mediating interaction with the NPC but suggest an indirect role for factors involved in mRNA export or transcription. A conserved \"positioning domain\" within Gcn4 controls interaction with the NPC and inter-chromosomal clustering and promotes transcription of target genes. Such a function may be quite common; a comprehensive screen reveals that tethering of most yeast TFs is sufficient to promote targeting to the NPC. While some TFs require Nup100, others do not, suggesting two distinct targeting mechanisms. These results highlight an important and underappreciated function of TFs in controlling the spatial organization of the yeast genome through interaction with the NPC.",

Mediator functions as an integrator of transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors and with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to both activate and repress gene expression. Mediator has been shown to affect multiple steps in transcription, including chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters, pre-initiation complex formation, transcriptional elongation, and mRNA splicing. Individual Mediator subunits participate in regulation of gene expression by the estrogen and androgen receptors and are altered in a number of endocrine cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. In addition to its role in genomic signaling, MED12 has been implicated in non-genomic signaling by interacting with and activating TGF-beta receptor 2 in the cytoplasm. Recent structural studies have revealed extensive inter-domain interactions and complex architecture of the Mediator-Pol II complex, suggesting that Mediator is capable of reorganizing its conformation and composition to fit cellular needs. We propose that alterations in Mediator subunit expression that occur in various cancers could impact the organization and function of Mediator, resulting in changes in gene expression that promote malignancy. A better understanding of the role of Mediator in cancer could reveal new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of Mediator-dependent endocrine cancers, especially in settings of therapy resistance.",

In this work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive med17 mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation complex (PIC) formation in vivo at the genome level after a transfer to a non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes. The effect of a yeast mutation proposed to be equivalent to the human Med17-L371P responsible for infantile cerebral atrophy was also analyzed. The ChIP-seq results demonstrate that med17 mutations differentially affected the global presence of several PIC components including Mediator, TBP, TFIIH modules and Pol II. Our data show that Mediator stabilizes TFIIK kinase and TFIIH core modules independently, suggesting that the recruitment or the stability of TFIIH modules is regulated independently on yeast genome. We demonstrate that Mediator selectively contributes to TBP recruitment or stabilization to chromatin. This study provides an extensive genome-wide view of Mediator's role in PIC formation, suggesting that Mediator coordinates multiple steps of a PIC assembly pathway.",

Here, we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains.

Here, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Mediator subunits in wild-type and mutant yeast cells in which RNA polymerase II promoter escape is blocked, allowing detection of transient Mediator forms. We found that although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless interacts with core promoters.

Novel roles of Mediator in the control of gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear space.

We developed LowMACA (Low frequency Mutations Analysis via Consensus Alignment), a method that combines the mutations of various proteins sharing the same functional domains to identify conserved residues that harbor clustered mutations in multiple sequence alignments. LowMACA is designed to visualize and statistically assess potential driver genes through the identification of their mutational hotspots. We analyzed the Ras superfamily exploiting the known driver mutations of the trio K-N-HRAS, identifying new putative driver mutations and genes belonging to less known members of the Rho, Rab and Rheb subfamilies. Furthermore, we applied the same concept to a list of known and candidate driver genes, and observed that low confidence genes show similar patterns of mutation compared to high confidence genes of the same protein family. LowMACA is a software for the identification of gain-of-function mutations in putative oncogenic families, increasing the amount of information on functional domains and their possible role in cancer.

In the pooled trials, the percentage of patients with disability worsening confirmed at 3 months was 10.9% with ofatumumab and 15.0% with teriflunomide (hazard ratio, 0.66; P = 0.002); the percentage with disability worsening confirmed at 6 months was 8.1% and 12.0%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.68; P = 0.01); and the percentage with disability improvement confirmed at 6 months was 11.0% and 8.1% (hazard ratio, 1.35; P = 0.09). The number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted MRI scan, the annualized rate of lesions on T2-weighted MRI, and serum neurofilament light chain levels, but not the change in brain volume, were in the same direction as the primary end point. Injection-related reactions occurred in 20.2% in the ofatumumab group and in 15.0% in the teriflunomide group (placebo injections). Serious infections occurred in 2.5% and 1.8% of the patients in the respective groups.

This study aims to evaluate the associations between circulating antioxidant minerals and clinical biomarkers of vascular calcification in HD patients. Blood biochemical parameters, antioxidant minerals (selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg)), and several promoters and inhibitors of calcification (matrix Gla protein (MGP), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and -2)) were determined in HD patients (n = 62) and age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n = 30). Compared with healthy subjects, HD patients had significantly lower plasma concentrations of Se and Zn, increased Cu and Mg, and higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (Cu/Zn ratios, malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and C-reactive protein (CRP)). We observed that HD patients had significantly lower concentrations of MGP and higher levels of FGF-23, MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1 and -2, and MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios. We also observed significant relationships between the concentrations of these minerals and calcification biomarkers in HD patients. These results suggest that changes in the homeostasis of antioxidant minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg) may contribute to the effects of oxidative stress and inflammatory status, thereby participating in the mechanism for accelerated vascular calcification in patients undergoing long-term HD.",

It is characterized by ectopic brain calcification, mostly affecting basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. PFBC patients can present a wide spectrum of symptoms including cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor alterations. However, it is well established that PFBC individuals also present high clinical heterogeneity, though the genetic cause of this phenotypic is not understood. Recently, Wang et al. (Front Cell Neurosci. https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2019.00250, 2019) reported on the role of MEA6 gene in cerebellar development and motor performance, also citing that MEA6 might be linked to PFBC. A MEA6 variant was described in 2007 as a PFBC candidate gene in an American family. However, this family was later linked to the SLC20A2 gene discarding the MEA6 as a PFBC-gene and also some members were confirmed as phenocopy. Additionally, five independent studies have been shown that variants in a second gene, not related to PFBC, were identified in PFBC patients, promoting a complex and heterogeneous phenotype. Thus, further investigation is required to explain whether and how MEA6 contributes to the clinical presentation in this American family. Finally, this letter highlights the possible digenic influence on clinical heterogeneity of PFBC patients, and such a possibility might advance our understanding of PFBC phenotypes.",

Whether RA controls ectopic calcification in humans is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that RA regulates osteogenic differentiation of human arterial smooth muscle cells and aortic valvular interstitial cells that participate in atherosclerosis and heart valve disease, respectively. Approach and Results: Human cardiovascular tissue contains immunoreactive RAR (RA receptor)-a retinoid-activated nuclear receptor directing multiple transcriptional programs. RA stimulation suppressed primary human cardiovascular cell calcification while treatment with the RAR inhibitor AGN 193109 or <i>RAR\u03b1</i> siRNA increased calcification. RA attenuated calcification in a coordinated manner, increasing levels of the calcification inhibitor MGP (matrix Gla protein) while decreasing calcification-promoting TNAP (tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase) activity. Given that nuclear receptor action varies as a function of distinct ligand structures, we compared calcification responses to cyclic retinoids and the acyclic retinoid peretinoin. Peretinoin suppressed human cardiovascular cell calcification without inducing either secretion of APOC3 (apolipoprotein-CIII), which promotes atherogenesis, or reducing CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1) expression, which occurred with cyclic retinoids all-<i>trans</i> RA, 9-<i>cis</i> RA, and 13-<i>cis</i> RA. Additionally, peretinoin did not suppress human femur osteoblast mineralization, whereas all-<i>trans</i> RA inhibited osteoblast mineralization. These results establish retinoid regulation of human cardiovascular calcification, provide new insight into mechanisms involved in these responses, and suggest selective retinoid modulators, like acyclic retinoids may allow for treating cardiovascular calcification without the adverse effects associated with cyclic retinoids.",

Novel anti-migraine drugs target CGRP signaling through either stimulation of 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptors on trigeminovascular nerves (resulting in inhibition of CGRP release) or direct blockade of CGRP or its receptor. Lasmiditan is a highly selective 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonist and, unlike the triptans, is devoid of vasoconstrictive properties, allowing its use in patients with cardiovascular risk. Since lasmiditan can actively penetrate the blood-brain barrier, central therapeutic as well as side effects mediated by 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor activation should be further investigated. Other novel anti-migraine drugs target CGRP signaling directly. This neuropeptide can be targeted by the monoclonal antibodies eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab, or by CGRP-neutralizing L-aptamers called Spiegelmers. The CGRP receptor can be targeted by the monoclonal antibody erenumab, or by small-molecule antagonists called gepants. Currently, rimegepant and ubrogepant have been developed for acute migraine treatment, while atogepant is studied for migraine prophylaxis.

It is characterized by episodic, often disabling headache, photophobia and phonophobia, autonomic symptoms (nausea and vomiting), and in a subgroup an aura in the beginning of the attack. Although still debated, many researchers consider migraine to be a disorder in which CNS dysfunction plays a pivotal role while various parts of the trigeminal system are necessary for the expression of associated symptoms.Treatment of migraine has in recent years seen the development of drugs that target the trigeminal sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor. Several of these drugs are now approved for use in frequent episodic and in chronic migraine. CGRP-related therapies offer considerable improvements over existing drugs, as they are the first to be designed specifically to act on the trigeminal pain system: they are more specific and have little or no adverse effects. Small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, gepants, are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (Eptinezumab, Fremanezumab, and Galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (Erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks.

Thus, new acutely acting antimigraine drugs are currently being developed, among which the small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, gepants, and the 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonist lasmiditan. Whether treatment with these drugs carries the same risk for developing MOH is currently unknown. Pathophysiological studies on MOH in animal models have suggested that decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) levels, increased calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) expression and changes in 5-HT receptor expression (lower 5-HT<sub>1B/D</sub> and higher 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> expression) may be involved in MOH. The decreased 5-HT may increase cortical spreading depression frequency and induce central sensitization in the cerebral cortex and caudal nucleus of the trigeminal tract. Additionally, low concentrations of 5-HT, a feature often observed in MOH patients, could increase CGRP expression. This provides a possible link between the pathways of 5-HT and CGRP, targets of lasmiditan and gepants, respectively. Since lasmiditan is a 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonist and gepants are CGRP receptor antagonists, they could have different risks for developing MOH because of the different (over) compensation mechanisms following prolonged agonist versus antagonist treatment. The acute treatment of migraine will certainly improve with the advent of two novel classes of drugs, i.e., the 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists (lasmiditan) and the small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants).

The development of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (CGRP-RAs) that showed clinical antimigraine efficacy acutely and prophylactically in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials subsequently gave definitive pharmacological proof of the importance of CGRP in migraine. More recently, CGRP target engagement imaging studies using a CGRP receptor PET ligand [<sup>11</sup> C]MK-4232 demonstrated that there was no brain CGRP receptor occupancy at clinically effective antimigraine doses of telcagepant, a prototypic CGRP-RA. Taken together, these data indicated that (1) the therapeutic site of action of the CGRP-RAs was peripheral not central; (2) that IV CGRP had most likely evoked migraine through an action at sites outside the blood-brain barrier; and (3) that migraine pain was therefore, at least in part, peripheral in origin. The evolution of CGRP migraine science gave impetus to the development of peripherally acting drugs that could modulate CGRP chronically to prevent frequent episodic and chronic migraine.

We demonstrate that duplicated genes can maintain substantial redundancy for extensive periods of time following duplication ( approximately 100 million years). We find high levels of redundancy among genes duplicated both via the whole genome duplication and via smaller scale duplications.

With reduced functional constraints or through positive selection, these duplicated genes may experience accelerated evolution. Under the model of subfunctionalization, loss of subfunctions leads to complementary acceleration at sites with two copies, and the difference in average rate between the sequences may not be obvious. On the other hand, the classical model of neofunctionalization predicts that the evolutionary rate in one of the two duplicates is accelerated. However, the classical model does not tell which of the duplicates experiences the acceleration in evolutionary rate. Here, we present evidence from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome that a duplicate located in a genomic region with a low-recombination rate is likely to evolve faster than a duplicate in an area of high recombination. This observation is consistent with population genetics theory that predicts that purifying selection is less effective in genomic regions of low recombination (Hill-Robertson effect). Together with previous studies, our results suggest the genomic background (e.g., local recombination rate) as a potential force to drive the divergence between nontandemly duplicated genes.

On the basis of the inferred phylogeny of each set of genes, we were able to deduce whether the gene duplicated and/or specialized before or after the divergence of two yeast lineages. Here we show that the gene duplications might have occurred as a single event, and that it probably took place before the Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces lineages diverged from each other.

We perform an exhaustive analysis of the transcriptional alterations of duplicated genes in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae when challenged with five different environmental stresses. Analysis of the transcriptomes of yeast shows that gene duplication increases the transcriptional response to environmental changes, with duplicated genes exhibiting signatures of adaptive transcriptional patterns in response to stress. The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome duplicates being more transcriptionally altered than small-scale duplicates. The predominant transcriptional pattern follows the classic theory of evolution by gene duplication; with one gene copy remaining unaltered under stress, while its sister copy presents large transcriptional plasticity and a prominent role in adaptation. Moreover, we find additional transcriptional profiles that are suggestive of neo- and subfunctionalization of duplicate gene copies. These patterns are strongly correlated with the functional dependencies and sequence divergence profiles of gene copies. We show that, unlike singletons, duplicates respond more specifically to stress, supporting the role of natural selection in the transcriptional plasticity of duplicates.

The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome duplicates exhibiting different preservation trends compared to small-scale duplicates. Genome mutational and transcriptional hotspots are rich in duplicates with large repetitive promoter elements.

However, most duplicated genes are eventually lost and it is still unclear why some duplicated genes are evolutionary successful whereas others quickly turn to pseudogenes. Here, we show that dosage constraints are major factors opposing post-WGD gene loss in several Paramecium species that share a common ancestral WGD. We propose a model where a majority of WGD-derived duplicates preserve their ancestral function and are retained to produce enough of the proteins performing this same ancestral function. Under this model, the expression level of individual duplicated genes can evolve neutrally as long as they maintain a roughly constant summed expression, and this allows random genetic drift toward uneven contributions of the two copies to total expression. Our analysis suggests that once a high level of imbalance is reached, which can require substantial lengths of time, the copy with the lowest expression level contributes a small enough fraction of the total expression that selection no longer opposes its loss. Extension of our analysis to yeast species sharing a common ancestral WGD yields similar results, suggesting that duplicated-gene retention for dosage constraints followed by divergence in expression level and eventual deterministic gene loss might be a universal feature of post-WGD evolution.",

Moreover, genes with numerous paralogs in the yeast genome do not have especially low number of regulatory motifs. These findings indicate that degenerative complementation is not the sole mechanism behind expression divergence in yeast.

We partition the yeast duplicates into ohnologs (generated by a whole-genome duplication) and non-ohnologs (from small-scale duplication events) to determine whether their disparate origins commit them to divergent evolutionary trajectories and genomic attributes. We conclude that, for the most part, ohnologs tend to appear remarkably similar to non-ohnologs in their structural attributes (specifically the relative composition frequencies of complete, partial and chimeric duplicates), the discernible length of the duplicated region (duplication span) as well as genomic location. Furthermore, we find notable differences in the features of S. cerevisiae gene duplicates relative to those of another eukaryote, Caenorhabditis elegans, with respect to chromosomal location, extent of duplication and the relative frequencies of complete, partial and chimeric duplications.

FTY720/fingolimod, a prodrug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is phosphorylated in vivo to its active phosphorylated form by sphingosine kinase 2 and has been shown to interfere with the actions of S1P and to inhibit ceramide biosynthesis. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in a diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis. In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the active phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, FTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly increased in these mice. Hence, FTY720 might be useful for attenuating FASN expression and triglyceride accumulation associated with steatosis.",

Candidate genes enriched in DNPC were determined using differential gene expression analysis of discovery and validation cohorts of mCRPC biopsies. Laboratory studies were carried out in human mCRPC organoid cultures, prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and mouse xenograft models. Epigenetic studies were carried out in a rapid autopsy cohort. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 <i>v</i> 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; <i>q</i> &lt; 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 <i>v</i> 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001). DKK1 expression can be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with activating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). <i>DKK1</i> hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA expression (Pearson <i>r</i> = -0.66; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). DKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of quiescent natural killer (NK) cells (<i>P</i> &lt; .005) and lower numbers of activated NK cells (<i>P</i> &lt; .0005). Growth inhibition of the human PCa model PC3 by the anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody DKN-01 depends on the presence of NK cells in a severe combined immunodeficient xenograft mouse model. These results support DKK1 as a contributor to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of DNPC. These data have provided the rationale for a clinical trial targeting DKK1 in mCRPC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03837353\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT03837353</a>).",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18687985": "Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is central to bone development and homeostasis in adulthood and its deregulation is associated with bone pathologies. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a soluble inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling required for embryonic head development, regulates Wnt signaling by binding to the Wnt coreceptor lipoprotein-related protein-5 (LRP5)/Arrow. LRP5 mutations causing high bone mass syndromes disrupt DKK1-mediated regulation of LRP5. Forced overexpression of Dkk1 in osteoblasts causes osteopenia, disruption of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche, and defects in HSC function. Dkk1 also inhibits fracture repair. Studies suggest that DKK1 activation in osteoblasts is the underlying cause of glucocorticoid- and estrogen deficiency-mediated osteoporosis, and at least partially underlies the teratogenic effects of thalidomide on limb development. DKK1 induces proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in vitro and may play a role in the development of high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas derived from MSC and osteosarcomas. DKK1 has been implicated in causing erosive arthritis, the osteolytic phenotypes of multiple myeloma and metastatic breast cancer, and osteoblastic metastases of prostate cancer. Preclinical studies have shown that neutralizing DKK1/Dkk1 and/or enhancing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may prove effective in treating bone pathologies. Here, we review the rapidly growing body of literature defining a pivotal role for DKK1 in bone health and disease.",

In this study, we report the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) in multiple common cancers. This constitutes a comprehensive analysis of the DKK1 expression profile. Dickkopf-1 expression was evaluated by classical and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay for protein determination, in cancer lines and clinical specimens of several cancer origins. For breast cancer, expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Dickkopf-1 expression was confirmed in several cancer cell lines derived from breast and other common cancers. Dickkopf-1 protein secretion was documented in breast, prostate and lung cancer lines, but was negligible in melanoma. Analysis of DKK1 expression in human cancer specimens revealed DKK1 expression in breast (21 out of 73), lung (11 out of 23) and kidney cancers (six out of 20). Interestingly, DKK1 was preferentially expressed in oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative tumours (ER(-)/PR(-); P=0.005) and in tumours from women with a family history of breast cancer (P=0.024). Importantly, DKK1 protein production was confirmed in multiple breast cancer specimens that were positive by RT-PCR. This work establishes DKK1 as a potential prognostic and diagnostic marker for cohorts of breast cancer patients with poor prognosis.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26913608": "The Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) has been associated with the occurrence of bone metastases in osteotropic prostate cancer by inhibiting osteoblastogenesis. P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is also dysregulated in advanced prostate cancer. However, the impact of p38 MAPK signaling on DKK-1 remains unknown. Inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling in osteolytic PC3 cells by small molecule inhibitors (doramapimod, LY2228820 and SB202190) suppressed DKK-1 expression, whereas activation of p38 MAPK by anisomycin increased DKK-1. Further dissection by targeting individual p38 MAPK isoforms with siRNA revealed a stronger role for MAPK11 than MAPK14 and MAPK12 in the regulation of DKK-1. Moreover, prostate cancer cells with a predominantly osteolytic phenotype produced sufficient amounts of DKK-1 to inhibit Wnt3a-induced osteoblastic differentiation in C2C12 cells. This inhibition was blocked directly by neutralizing DKK-1 using a specific antibody and also indirectly by blocking p38 MAPK. Furthermore, tissue expression in human prostate cancer revealed a correlation between p38 MAPK and DKK-1 expression with higher expression in tumor compared with normal tissues. These results reveal that p38 MAPK regulates DKK-1 in prostate cancer and may present a potential target in osteolytic prostate cancers.",

When suspecting a hemophilic pseudotumor, biopsy will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out true tumors (chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) that sometimes mimic hemophilic pseudotumor. Surgical removal of hemophilic pseudotumor is the best solution. As alternatives, there are curettage and filling with cancellous bone and radiotherapy (when surgery is contraindicated).

Their clinical features, surgical management, outcomes and complications after surgery were analysed. We identified 34 patients with HPT who had surgical treatment over a 12-year period and five of them had multiple HPTs. The incidence of HPT at this centre was 2.3% over the dozen years. A previous trauma leading to the development of HPT was reported in 18 cases (52.9%). The HPT affected only soft tissue in 7 patients, bone and soft tissue in 25 ones and joint in 2 ones. Preoperative infection and fistula formation happened in ten patients, two of whom were related to abdominal HPTs. Enterococcus faecalis was cultured in five cases with fistula formation. HPT associated with pathological fracture was observed in five cases, two of whom were treated by external fixation and 3 by HPT resection and metallic internal fixation.

We wanted to present our experience in the surgical management of hemophilic pseudotumors over a 40-year period. We retrospectively reviewed 429 hemorrhagic coagulopathy patients between 1983 and 2015. Diagnosis of hemophilic pseudotumor was confirmed following clinical, radiological, and pathological criteria. The data were recorded and analyzed: type and severity of hemophilia, presence of inhibitor, etiological antecedent, localization of pseudotumors, clinical signs, surgical management and outcomes. Eighteen pseudotumor patients underwent surgical treatment. All of them were male, with mean age of 34.3 years. Fifteen patients had hemophilia A and three patients had hemophilia B. There were twelve proximal and two distal pseudotumor patients. The mean follow-up was 51.9 months. For pseudotumors in the extremities, complete surgical resection was achieved. For four patients with pelvic or abdominal pseudotumors, complete surgical resection was only achieved in two patients because of preventing potential vital organs injuries.

On presentation to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients with giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor who can undergo appropriate surgical treatment. This represents a safe and reasonable approach to sustainably relieve pain and other symptoms with giant hemophilic pseudotumor in the abdomen. Perioperative coagulation factor replacement therapy is also of great significance in reducing the risks and complications.",

As starting material, we employ plant lines that express GFP-tagged ribosomal protein RPL18 in a cell type-specific manner by use of adequate promoters. Prior to immunopurification and RNA extraction, the tissue is snap frozen, which preserves tissue integrity and simultaneously allows execution of time series studies with high temporal resolution. Notably, cell wall structures remain intact, which is a major drawback in alternative procedures such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques, which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs. Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.",

Epigenetic control of gene expression by those experiences affect discrete brain regions involved in mood, cognitive function and regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In rodents, acute restraint stress increases the expression of the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) in hippocampal fields, including the CA3 pyramidal neurons. These CA3 neurons are crucially involved in cognitive function and mood regulation as well as activation of glucocorticoid (CORT) secretion. CA3 neurons also exhibit structural and functional changes after early-life stress (ELS) as well as after chronic stress in adulthood. Using a protocol of chronic ELS induced by limited bedding and nesting material followed by acute-swim stress (AS) in adulthood, we show that mice with a history of ELS display a blunted CORT response to AS, despite exhibiting activation of immediate early genes after stress similar to that found in control mice. We find that ELS induced persistently increased expression of the repressive H3K9me3 histone mark in the CA3 subfield at baseline that was subsequently decreased following AS. In contrast, AS induced a transient increase of this mark in control mice. Using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) method to isolate CA3 translating mRNAs, we found that expression of genes of the epigenetic gene family, GABA/glutamate family, and glucocorticoid receptors binding genes were decreased transiently in control mice by AS and showed a persistent reduction in ELS mice. In most cases, AS in ELS mice did not induce gene expression changes. A stringent filtering of genes affected by AS in control and ELS mice revealed a noteworthy decrease in gene expression change in ELS mice compared to control. Only 18 genes were selectively regulated by AS in ELS mice and encompassed pathways such as circadian rhythm, inflammatory response, opioid receptors, and more genes included in the glucocorticoid receptor binding family. Thus, ELS programs a restricted translational response to stress in stress-sensitive CA3 neurons leading to persistent changes in gene expression, some of which mimic the transient effects of AS in control mice, while leaving in operation the immediate early gene response to AS.",

Thus, profiling the transcriptomes of specific cell and tissue types remains an important tool for understanding how cells become specialized. Methodological approaches to detect gene expression differences have utilized samples from whole animals, dissected tissues, and more recently single cells. Despite these advances, there is still a challenge and a need in most laboratories to implement less invasive yet powerful cell-type specific transcriptome profiling methods. Here, we describe the use of the Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) method for C. elegans to detect cell type-specific gene expression patterns at the level of translating mRNAs. In TRAP, a ribosomal protein is fused to a tag (GFP) and is expressed under cell type-specific promoters to mark genetically defined cell types in vivo. Affinity purification of lysates of animals expressing the tag enriches for ribosome-associated mRNAs of the targeted tissue. The purified mRNAs are used for making cDNA libraries subjected to high-throughput sequencing to obtain genome-wide profiles of transcripts from the targeted cell type. The ease of exposing C. elegans to diverse stimuli, coupled with available cell type specific promoters, makes TRAP a useful approach to enable the discovery of molecular components in response to external or genetic perturbations.",

The virus remains latent in neurons, and it can reactivate later in life, causing herpes zoster (HZ). Two different vaccines have been developed to prevent HZ; one is based on a live attenuated VZV strain (Zostavax), and the other is based on adjuvanted gE recombinant protein (Shingrix). While Zostavax efficacy wanes with age, Shingrix protection retains its efficacy in elderly subjects (individuals 80 years of age and older). In this context, it is of much interest to understand if there is a role for T cell immunity in the differential clinical outcome and if there is a correlate of protection between T cell immunity and Shingrix efficacy. In this study, we characterized the Shingrix-specific <i>ex vivo</i> CD4 T cell responses in the context of natural exposure and HZ vaccination using pools of predicted epitopes. We show that T cell reactivity following natural infection and Zostavax vaccination dominantly targets nonstructural (NS) proteins, while Shingrix vaccination redirects dominant reactivity to target gE. We mapped the gE-specific responses following Shingrix vaccination to 89 different gE epitopes, 34 of which accounted for 80% of the response. Using antigen presentation assays and single HLA molecule-transfected lines, we experimentally determined HLA restrictions for 94 different donor/peptide combinations. Finally, we used our results as a training set to assess strategies to predict restrictions based on measured or predicted HLA binding and the corresponding HLA types of the responding subjects.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Understanding the T cell profile associated with the protection observed in elderly vaccinees following Shingrix vaccination is relevant to the general definition of correlates of vaccine efficacy. Our study enables these future studies by clarifying the patterns of immunodominance associated with Shingrix vaccination, as opposed to natural infection or Zostavax vaccination.

Some organisms have been shown to harbor multiple HP1-like proteins, each exhibiting spatially distinct localization patterns within interphase nuclei. We have characterized the subnuclear localization patterns of two newly discovered Drosophila HP1-like proteins (HP1b and HP1c), comparing them with that of the originally described fly HP1 protein (here designated HP1a). While HP1a targets heterochromatin, HP1b localizes to both heterochromatin and euchromatin and HP1c is restricted exclusively to euchromatin. All HP1-like proteins contain an amino-terminal chromo domain, a connecting hinge, and a carboxyl-terminal chromo shadow domain. We expressed truncated and chimeric HP1 proteins in vivo to determine which of these segments might be responsible for heterochromatin-specific and euchromatin-specific localization. Both the HP1a hinge and chromo shadow domain independently target heterochromatin, while the HP1c chromo shadow domain is implicated solely in euchromatin localization. Comparative sequence analyses of HP1 homologs reveal a conserved sequence block within the hinge that contains an invariant sequence (KRK) and a nuclear localization motif. This block is not conserved in the HP1c hinge, possibly accounting for its failure to function as an independent targeting segment. We conclude that sequence variations within the hinge and shadow account for HP1 targeting distinctions. We propose that these targeting features allow different HP1 complexes to be distinctly sequestered in organisms that harbor multiple HP1-like proteins.",

We found that HP1a plays an important role in the interaction between Ago3/Siwi and HP1b in the ovary-derived BmN4 cell line. We also found that Ago3/Siwi regulates the transcription in an HP1-dependent manner. These results suggest that silkworm Piwi proteins function as a chromatin regulator in collaboration with HP1a and HP1b.",

Most eukaryotes have at least three HP1 homologs that play differential roles in heterochromatin and euchromatin. However, despite the fact that the three HP1 proteins bind to different regions of the genome, several studies show that most of the interactions occur in a manner specific to HP1a. In addition, little is known about the overall interaction network of the three Drosophila HP1 homologs, HP1a, HP1b, and HP1c. Here, we performed the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of Drosophila HP1 homologs by coupling a double-affinity purification approach with MudPIT analysis to identify interacting proteins of Drosophila HP1. We discovered 160-310 proteins co-eluted with HP1, including a number of novel HP1-binding partners along with the previously identified HP1 binding proteins. Finally, we showed that slight and unique binding preferences might exist between the three HP1 proteins in Drosophila. These studies are the first to systematically analyze the interactome of HP1 paralogs and provide the basic clues as to the molecular mechanism by which HP1 might control cellular processes. Most eukaryotes have at least three HP1 homologs with similar domain structures but with differential roles in heterochromatin and euchromatin. However, little is known about the overall interactome of the three Drosophila HP1 homologs, HP1a, HP1b, and HP1c. The present study compared interacting proteins of three HP1 homologs in Drosophila. To better understand the underlying mechanisms for gene regulation of HP1, a double-affinity purification and MudPIT mass spectrometry were employed to identify differential proteins as well as common binding proteins of HP1. Therefore, this study provides not only the comparative proteomic analysis but also molecular mechanism underlying the HP1 homolog-specific function.",

Here we characterized the genome-wide effect of nuclear Piwi elimination on the presence of the heterochromatic H3K9me3 mark and HP1a, as well as on the transcription-associated mark H3K4me2. Our results demonstrate that a significant increase in the H3K4me2 level upon nuclear Piwi loss is not accompanied by the alterations in H3K9me3 and HP1a levels for several germline-expressed transposons, suggesting that in this case Piwi prevents transcription by a mechanism distinct from H3K9 methylation. We found that the targets of Piwi-dependent chromatin repression are mainly related to the elements that display a higher level of H3K4me2 modification in the absence of silencing, i.e. most actively transcribed elements. We also show that Piwi-guided silencing does not significantly influence the chromatin state of dual-strand piRNA-producing clusters. In addition, host protein-coding gene expression is essentially not affected due to the nuclear Piwi elimination, but we noted an increase in small nuclear spliceosomal RNAs abundance and propose Piwi involvement in their post-transcriptional regulation. Our work reveals new aspects of transposon silencing in Drosophila, indicating that transcription of transposons can underpin their Piwi dependent silencing, while canonical heterochromatin marks are not obligatory for their repression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28636597": "Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes that has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome stability, and silencing of transposon and gene expression. Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in steric exclusion of regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase from the underlying DNA. However, compaction alone does not account for the formation of distinct, multi-chromosomal, membrane-less heterochromatin domains within the nucleus, fast diffusion of proteins inside the domain, and other dynamic features of heterochromatin. Here we present data that support an alternative hypothesis: that the formation of heterochromatin domains is mediated by phase separation, a phenomenon that gives rise to diverse non-membrane-bound nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments. We show that Drosophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid-liquid demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos. Furthermore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, heterochromatin domains exhibit dynamics that are characteristic of liquid phase-separation, including sensitivity to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions, and reduced diffusion, increased coordinated movement and inert probe exclusion at the domain boundary. We conclude that heterochromatic domains form via phase separation, and mature into a structure that includes liquid and stable compartments. We propose that emergent biophysical properties associated with phase-separated systems are critical to understanding the unusual behaviours of heterochromatin, and how chromatin domains in general regulate essential nuclear functions.",

However, in Kc167 cell culture, the only Drosophilla cell type where LADs have previously been mapped, they are neither H3K9me2-enriched nor overlapped with the domains of heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Here, using cell type-specific DamID we mapped genome-wide LADs, HP1a and Polycomb (Pc) domains from the central brain, Repo-positive glia, Elav-positive neurons and the fat body of Drosophila third instar larvae. Strikingly, contrary to Kc167 cells of embryonic origin, in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in glia and the fat body, HP1a domains appear to overlap strongly with LADs in both the chromosome arms and pericentromeric regions. Accordingly, centromeres reside closer to the nuclear lamina in neurons than in Kc167 cells. As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc domains. These domains are occupied by silent or weakly expressed genes with genes residing in the HP1a-bound LADs expressed at the lowest level. In various differentiated Drosophila cell types, we discovered the existence of peripheral heterochromatin, similar to that observed in mammals. Our findings support the model that peripheral heterochromatin matures enhancing the repression of unwanted genes as cells terminally differentiate.",

Piwi-piRNA complex mediates transcriptional silencing of transposons in nucleus. Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) has been proposed to function downstream of Piwi-piRNA complex in Drosophila. Here we show that HP1a germline knockdown (HP1a-GLKD) leads to a reduction in the total and Piwi-bound piRNAs mapping to clusters and transposons insertions, predominantly in the regions close to telomeres and centromeres, resulting in derepression of a limited number of transposons from these regions. In addition, HP1a-GLKD increases the splicing of transcripts arising from clusters in above regions, suggesting HP1a also functions upstream to piRNA processing. Evolutionarily old transposons enriched in the pericentric regions exhibit significant loss in piRNAs targeting these transposons upon HP1a-GLKD. Our study suggests that HP1a functions to repress transposons in a chromosomal compartmentalised manner.",

Previously, we have shown that transgenes containing a fragment of the <i>I</i> retrotransposon form de novo piRNA clusters in the <i>Drosophila</i> germline providing suppression of <i>I</i>-element activity. We noted that identical transgenes located in different genomic sites vary considerably in piRNA production and classified them as \"strong\" and \"weak\" piRNA clusters. Here, we investigated what chromatin and transcriptional changes occur at the transgene insertion sites after their conversion into piRNA clusters. We found that the formation of a transgenic piRNA cluster is accompanied by activation of transcription from both genomic strands that likely initiates at multiple random sites. The chromatin of all transgene-associated piRNA clusters contain high levels of trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) and HP1a, whereas Rhino binding is considerably higher at the strong clusters. None of these chromatin marks was revealed at the \"empty\" sites before transgene insertion. Finally, we have shown that in the nucleus of polyploid nurse cells, the formation of a piRNA cluster at a given transgenic genomic copy works according to an \"all-or-nothing\" model: either there is high Rhino enrichment or there is no association with Rhino at all. As a result, genomic copies of a weak piRNA transgenic cluster show a mosaic association with Rhino foci, while the majority of strong transgene copies associate with Rhino and are hence involved in piRNA production.",

Sequence analysis showed that Spodoptera Su(var) 3-9 is highly conserved evolutionarily. Su(var) 3-9 protein was found to be localized in the nucleus in Sf9 cells, and interact with histone H3, and the heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) and HP1b. A dose-dependent enzymatic activity was found at both 27 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C in vitro, with higher activity at 27 \u00b0C. Addition of specific inhibitor chaetocin resulted in decreased histone methylation level and host chromatin relaxation. In contrast, overexpression of Su(var) 3-9 caused increased histone methylation level and cellular genome compaction. In AcMNV-infected Sf9 cells, the transcription of Su(var) 3-9 increased at late time of infection, although the mRNA levels of most cellular genes decreased. Pre-treatment of Sf9 cells with chaetocin speeded up viral DNA replication, and increased the transcription level of a variety of virus genes, whereas in Sf9 cells pre-transformed with Su(var) 3-9 expression vector, viral DNA replication slow down slightly. These findings suggest that Su(var) 3-9 might participate in the viral genes expression an genome replication repression during AcMNPV infection.

An important component of the telomeres is the heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Mutations in Su(var)205, the gene encoding HP1a in Drosophila, result in telomeric fusions, retrotransposon regulation loss and larger telomeres, leading to chromosome instability. Previously, it was found that several proteins physically interact with HP1a, including dXNP and dAdd1 (orthologues to the mammalian ATRX gene). In this study, we found that mutations in the genes encoding the dXNP and dAdd1 proteins affect chromosome stability, causing chromosomal aberrations, including telomeric defects, similar to those observed in Su(var)205 mutants. In somatic cells, we observed that dXNP and dAdd1 participate in the silencing of the telomeric HTT array of retrotransposons, preventing anomalous retrotransposon transcription and integration. Furthermore, the lack of dAdd1 results in the loss of HP1a from the telomeric regions without affecting other chromosomal HP1a binding sites; mutations in dxnp also affected HP1a localization but not at all telomeres, suggesting a specialized role for dAdd1 and dXNP proteins in locating HP1a at the tips of the chromosomes. These results place dAdd1 as an essential regulator of HP1a localization and function in the telomere heterochromatic domain.",

Although HP1a is generally regarded as a factor that represses gene transcription, several reports have linked HP1a binding to active genes, and in some cases, it has been shown to stimulate transcriptional activity. To clarify the function of HP1a in transcription regulation and its association with Su(var)3-9, SETDB1 and the chromosome 4-specific protein POF, we conducted genome-wide expression studies and combined the results with available binding data in Drosophila melanogaster. The results suggest that HP1a, SETDB1 and Su(var)3-9 repress genes on chromosome 4, where non-ubiquitously expressed genes are preferentially targeted, and stimulate genes in pericentromeric regions. Further, we showed that on chromosome 4, Su(var)3-9, SETDB1 and HP1a target the same genes. In addition, we found that transposons are repressed by HP1a and Su(var)3-9 and that the binding level and expression effects of HP1a are affected by gene length.

Although Eyg has been shown to act as a repressor, nothing is known about the mechanism by which it represses its target genes. Here, we show that Eyg forms a protein complex with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Both proteins bind to the same chromatin regions on polytene chromosomes and act cooperatively to suppress variegation and mediate gene silencing. In addition, Eyg binds to a wingless (wg) enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to assemble a closed, heterochromatin-like conformation that represses transcription of the wg gene. We describe here the evidence that suggests that Eyg, encoded by eyegone (eyg), represses wingless (wg) during eye development by association with HP1a. We show that Eyg forms a protein complex with HP1a and both proteins colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Using position effect variegation (PEV) experiments, we demonstrated that eyg has a dose-dependent effect on heterochromatin gene silencing and identified a genetic interaction with HP1a in this process. We further demonstrated that HP1a binds to the same wg enhancer element as Eyg. DNase I sensitivity assays indicated that this enhancer region has a closed heterochromatin-like conformation, which becomes open in eyg mutants. In these mutants, much less HP1a binds to the wg enhancer region, as shown by ChIP experiments. Furthermore, as previously described for Eyg, a reduction in the amount of HP1a in the eye imaginal disc derepresses wg. Together, our results suggest a model in which Eyg specifically binds to the wg enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to that site. The recruitment of HP1a prevents transcription by favoring a closed, heterochromatin-like structure. Thus, for the first time, we show that HP1a plays a direct role in the repression of a developmentally regulated gene, wg, during Drosophila eye development.",

Previous studies have shown that the c-Jun gene is positively autoregulated by its product. Notably, it has also been reported that c-Jun proteins are enriched in its gene body region. However, the role of c-Jun proteins in its gene body region has yet to be uncovered. HP1a is an evolutionarily conserved heterochromatin-associated protein, which plays an essential role in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. Interestingly, accumulating evidence shows that HP1a is also localized to euchromatic regions to positively regulate gene transcription. However, the underlying mechanism has not been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that HP1a is involved in the positive autoregulatory loop of the Jra gene, the c-Jun homolog in Drosophila. Jra recruits the HP1a/KDM4A complex to its gene body region upon osmotic stress to reduce H3K36 methylation levels and disrupt H3K36 methylation-dependent histone deacetylation, resulting in high levels of histone acetylation in the Jra gene body region, thus promoting gene transcription. These results not only expand our knowledge toward the mechanism of c-Jun regulation, but also reveal the mechanism by which HP1a exerts its positive regulatory function in gene expression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19798443": "Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a) is a well-known conserved protein involved in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in different species including humans. A general model has been proposed for heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing in different species that implies an essential role for HP1a. According to the model, histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTases) methylate the histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me), creating selective binding sites for itself and the chromodomain of HP1a. This complex is thought to form a higher order chromatin state that represses gene activity. It has also been found that HP1a plays a role in telomere capping. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that HP1a is present at many euchromatic sites along polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, including the developmental and heat-shock-induced puffs, and that this protein can be removed from these sites by in vivo RNase treatment, thus suggesting an association of HP1a with the transcripts of many active genes. To test this suggestion, we performed an extensive screening by RIP-chip assay (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays), and we found that HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes. An expression analysis in HP1a mutants shows that HP1a is required for positive regulation of these genes. Cytogenetic and molecular assays show that HP1a also interacts with the well known proteins DDP1, HRB87F, and PEP, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing. Surprisingly, we found that all these hnRNP proteins also bind heterochromatin and are dominant suppressors of position effect variegation. Together, our data show novel and unexpected functions for HP1a and hnRNPs proteins. All these proteins are in fact involved both in RNA transcript processing and in heterochromatin formation.

Previous reports of RRP were mainly attributed to chemotherapy and molecular-target agents. RRP induced by immunotherapy has been rarely reported. Here we describe a case of a novel pattern of RRP induced by anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab 2 years after radiotherapy, with some focus on further understanding of this phenomenon. <b>Case Report:</b> A 64-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) received two cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed first. Subsequently, he underwent concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed to simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) radiotherapy. After 15 months, due to tumor progression and brain metastasis, he started with administration of anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab (200 mg q2w) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The patient developed fever, dyspnea and cough after the eighth administration of Camrelizumab. Meanwhile, his chest CT revealed patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities localized within the previously irradiated area. Subsequent treatment regimen was adjusted to 80 mg q12h prednisolone with discontinuation of Camrelizumab. Then the symptoms gradually eased and reexamination of CT showed significant improvement in RRP after 2 weeks. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our case report presents a novel pattern of RRP induced by anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab 2 years after radiotherapy. This indicates that previous radiotherapy combined with subsequent anti-PD-1 blockade has a potential to cause overlapping damage to lung, suggesting that intensive attention might be needed for patients who are treated with anti-PD-1 blockade in conjunction with a prior history of thoracic radiation.",

The primary endpoints were objective response (per blinded independent central review) and 6-month overall survival, in all randomly assigned patients who had at least one dose of study treatment. Safety was analysed in all treated patients.

Median follow-up was 12\u00b75 months (IQR 5\u00b77-15\u00b75). Objective response was reported in 32 (14\u00b77%; 95% CI 10\u00b73-20\u00b72) of 217 patients. The overall survival probability at 6 months was 74\u00b74% (95% CI 68\u00b70-79\u00b77)]. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (22%) of 217 patients; the most common were increased aspartate aminotransferase (ten [5%]) and decreased neutrophil count (seven [3%]). Two deaths were judged by the investigators to be potentially treatment-related (one due to liver dysfunction and one due to multiple organ failure). Camrelizumab showed antitumour activity in pretreated Chinese patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with manageable toxicities, and might represent a new treatment option for these patients.

Patients received chemo-immunotherapy every 3 weeks until the second confirmed complete response (CR) or up to 12 cycles, followed by camrelizumab monotherapy for up to 1 year. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Twenty-seven response evaluable patients were enrolled, who received a median of three first-line therapies, 59% with bulky disease. The ORR was 74%, including 56% with a CR. A median time of 1.7 months to response was observed, with 78% exhibiting tumor shrinkage at the first evaluation. After 24.8 months median follow-up, the median duration of response was not reached, with a 65% 2-year estimated response rate. Thirteen responders remained in sustained complete remission.

We analysed hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC patients treated with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab in a retrospective single-center cohort from November 2018 to June 2020. Efficacy was evaluated with objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety data were also recorded. Seventy patients were finally included in the analysis: 23 were treated with toripalimab, 33 with camrelizumab, and 14 with sintilimab. The mean duration of follow-up was 44.7 (95% CI: 39.9-49.6) weeks and the mean cycles of PD-1 at cutoff were 8.3\u00b18.0 for all patients.

Targeting of PD-1 with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to block the interaction with its ligand PD-L1 has been successful for the treatment of multiple tumors. However, polymorphisms at N-glycosylation sites of PD-1 exist in the human population that might affect antibody binding, and dysregulated glycosylation has been observed in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate varied N-glycan composition in PD-1, and show that the binding affinity of camrelizumab, a recently approved PD-1-specific MAb, to non-glycosylated PD-1 proteins from E. coli is substantially decreased compared with glycosylated PD-1. The structure of the camrelizumab/PD-1 complex reveals that camrelizumab mainly utilizes its heavy chain to bind to PD-1, while the light chain sterically inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1. Glycosylation of asparagine 58 (N58) promotes the interaction with camrelizumab, while the efficiency of camrelizumab to inhibit the binding of PD-L1 is substantially reduced for glycosylation-deficient PD-1.

We aimed to comprehensively compare the efficacy and safety of different anti-PD-1 drugs, standard chemotherapy, and their combination therapy in RM-NPC.

The pooled incidence rates of grade 1-5/3-5 AEs were 74.1%/29.6, 54.2%/17.4, 92.3%/24.5, 96.8%/16.1, 91.2%/42.8, and 100%/87.9% for pembrolizumab, nivolumab, JS001, camrelizumab, chemotherapy and camrelizumab+chemotherapy, respectively, which suggested that nivolumab and pembrolizumab exhibited the optimal safety regarding grade 1-5 AEs whereas camrelizumab and nivolumab regarding grade 3-5 AEs. As second- or later-line therapy, ORR was higher with camrelizumab (34.1%), followed by pembrolizumab (26.3%), JS001 (23.3%), and nivolumab (19.0%); whereas ORR with first-line nivolumab reached 40%.

The aim of this study was to perform a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of camrelizumab to quantify the impact of patient characteristics and to investigate the appropriateness of a flat dose in the dosing regimen. A total of 3092 camrelizumab concentrations from 133 patients in four clinical trials with advanced melanoma, relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma and other solid tumor types were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. The PKs of camrelizumab were properly described using a two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear clearance. Then, covariate model building was conducted using stepwise forward addition and backward elimination. The results showed that baseline albumin had significant effects on linear clearance, while actual body weight affected intercompartmental clearance. However, their impacts were limited, and no dose adjustments were required. The final model was further evaluated by goodness-of-fit plots, bootstrap procedures, and visual predictive checks and showed satisfactory model performance. Moreover, dosing regimens of 200 mg every 2 weeks and 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks provided similar exposure distributions by model-based Monte Carlo simulation. The population analyses demonstrated that patient characteristics have no clinically meaningful impact on the PKs of camrelizumab and present evidence for no advantage of either the flat dose or weight-based dose regimen for most patients with advanced solid tumors.",

Foam cell, a hallmark of atherosclerosis, is prominently derived from monocyte-differentiated macrophage, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through unlimitedly phagocytizing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Therefore, the inhibition of monocyte adhesion to endothelium and uptake of oxLDL might be a breakthrough point for retarding atherosclerosis. Formononetin, an isoflavone extracted from <i>Astragalus membranaceus</i>, has exhibited multiple inhibitory effects on proatherogenic factors, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and inflammation in different animal models. However, its effect on atherosclerosis remains unknown. In this study, we determined if formononetin can inhibit atherosclerosis and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms. <b>Methods</b>: ApoE deficient mice were treated with formononetin contained in high-fat diet for 16 weeks. After treatment, mouse aorta, macrophage and serum samples were collected to determine lesions, immune cell profile, lipid profile and expression of related molecules. Concurrently, we investigated the effect of formononetin on monocyte adhesion, foam cell formation, endothelial activation, and macrophage polarization <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Results</b>: Formononetin reduced <i>en face</i> and aortic root sinus lesions size. Formononetin enhanced lesion stability by changing the composition of plaque. VSMC- and macrophage-derived foam cell formation and its accumulation in arterial wall were attenuated by formononetin, which might be attributed to decreased SRA expression and reduced monocyte adhesion. Formononetin inhibited atherogenic monocyte adhesion and inflammation. KLF4 negatively regulated the expression of SRA at transcriptional and translational level. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our study demonstrate that formononetin can substantially attenuate the development of atherosclerosis via regulation of interplay between KLF4 and SRA, which suggests the formononetin might be a novel therapeutic approach for inhibition of atherosclerosis.",

There is an urgent need to identify new molecular targets for treating AS, and thereby improve the quality of life and reduce the financial burden of individuals with CVD. An in vitro model of AS was generated by treating THP-1 cells and human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMCs) with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs). HA-VSMC proliferation and foam cell formation were detected by the MTT assay and Oil Red O staining. C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) expression was suppressed by siRNA. An AS rat model was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet and vitamin D2 for 3 weeks. Histopathology examinations were conducted by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and the levels ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) and \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression were determined by ELISA assays and immunohistochemistry. An in vitro model of AS was established with THP-1 cells. CXCL12 expression in the model THP-1 cells was significantly increased when compared with its expression in control cells. Suppression of CXCL12 expression reduced the progression of AS in the cell model. Moreover, CXCL12 promoted AS in the in vivo rat model. Our results suggest that CXCL12 plays an important role in promoting the progression of AS.

Poria cocos polysaccharides (PCP) has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, antitumor and anti-oxidative properties. In this study we explored the effects of PCP on ox-LDL-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and foam cell formation in VSMCs. PCP significantly attenuated ox-LDL-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by the decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MDA levels, and the increased SOD activity in VSMCs. PCP suppressed the induction effect of ox-LDL on inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators. PCP also substantially inhibited VSMCs foam cell formation and intracellular lipids accumulation. Mechanistically, PCP suppressed ox-LDL-induced up-regulation of LOX-1, which is responsible for ox-LDL uptake. Western blotting suggested that PCP activated ERK1/2 signaling pathway, increased Nrf2 translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Up-regulation of PCP on Nrf2/HO-1 signaling was reversed by pretreatment with ERK inhibitor PD98059, indicating the involvement of ERK in PCP activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that PCP exerted its protection against oxidative stress and inflammation via the ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and that PCP may be a promising candidate for the therapy of atherosclerosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32012706": "Excessive accumulation of lipid inclusions in the arterial wall cells (foam cell formation) caused by modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the earliest and most noticeable manifestation of atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of foam cell formation are not fully understood and can involve altered lipid uptake, impaired lipid metabolism, or both. Recently, we have identified the top 10 master regulators that were involved in the accumulation of cholesterol in cultured macrophages induced by the incubation with modified LDL. It was found that most of the identified master regulators were related to the regulation of the inflammatory immune response, but not to lipid metabolism. A possible explanation for this unexpected result is a stimulation of the phagocytic activity of macrophages by modified LDL particle associates that have a relatively large size. In the current study, we investigated gene regulation in macrophages using transcriptome analysis to test the hypothesis that the primary event occurring upon the interaction of modified LDL and macrophages is the stimulation of phagocytosis, which subsequently triggers the pro-inflammatory immune response. We identified genes that were up- or downregulated following the exposure of cultured cells to modified LDL or latex beads (inert phagocytosis stimulators). Most of the identified master regulators were involved in the innate immune response, and some of them were encoding major pro-inflammatory proteins. The obtained results indicated that pro-inflammatory response to phagocytosis stimulation precedes the accumulation of intracellular lipids and possibly contributes to the formation of foam cells. In this way, the currently recognized hypothesis that the accumulation of lipids triggers the pro-inflammatory response was not confirmed. Comparative analysis of master regulators revealed similarities in the genetic regulation of the interaction of macrophages with naturally occurring LDL and desialylated LDL. Oxidized and desialylated LDL affected a different spectrum of genes than naturally occurring LDL. These observations suggest that desialylation is the most important modification of LDL occurring in vivo. Thus, modified LDL caused the gene regulation characteristic of the stimulation of phagocytosis. Additionally, the knock-down effect of five master regulators, such as <i>IL15, EIF2AK3, F2RL1, TSPYL2</i>, and <i>ANXA1</i>, on intracellular lipid accumulation was tested. We knocked down these genes in primary macrophages derived from human monocytes. The addition of atherogenic naturally occurring LDL caused a significant accumulation of cholesterol in the control cells. The knock-down of the <i>EIF2AK3</i> and <i>IL15</i> genes completely prevented cholesterol accumulation in cultured macrophages. The knock-down of the <i>ANXA1</i> gene caused a further decrease in cholesterol content in cultured macrophages. At the same time, knock-down of <i>F2RL1</i> and <i>TSPYL2</i> did not cause an effect. The results obtained allowed us to explain in which way the inflammatory response and the accumulation of cholesterol are related confirming our hypothesis of atherogenesis development based on the following viewpoints: LDL particles undergo atherogenic modifications that, in turn, accompanied by the formation of self-associates; large LDL associates stimulate phagocytosis; as a result of phagocytosis stimulation, pro-inflammatory molecules are secreted; these molecules cause or at least contribute to the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Therefore, it became obvious that the primary event in this sequence is not the accumulation of cholesterol but an inflammatory response.",

Excessive LDL cholesterol uptake by macrophages in the aortic endothelium leads to formation of foam cells. Previous studies suggested that proanthocyanidins effectively suppress this process, while the in-depth mechanism has not been elucidated. In mononuclear THP-1 cells, we found that the oligomeric fraction of proanthocyanidins was more effective in suppressing foam cell formation and 25 \u03bcg ml-1 for 48 h were the optimum conditions. Under these model conditions, we investigated gene expression and for the first time reported expression of regulatory microRNA (miRNA). It was found that the proanthocyanidins restrained macrophage foaming mainly by lowering the expression levels of cholesterol influx-related receptors CD36 and SR-A, and promoting the expression of cholesterol efflux-related receptor ABCA1. Further, it was latest revealed that proanthocyanidins could notably inhibit the expression of ACAT1, a key gene for intracellular cholesterol esterification. Further investigation was performed on the expression of regulatory miRNAs (miR-134 for CD36, miR-134, miR-155 for SR-A, miR-155, let-7g for LOX-1, miR-9 for ACAT1, miR-27a, miR-19b, miR-10b and miR-33a for ABCA1). The relative expression of miR-9, a miRNA targeting ACAT1, was decreased after the treatment of proanthocyanidins. It was most likely that proanthocyanidins suppressed the expression of ACAT1 via up-regulating the expression of miR-9, thus lessening the intracellular lipid accumulation and eventually inhibiting macrophage foam cell formation. This assumption was further verified by use of miR-9 mimic and its inhibitor.",

We demonstrate that the uptake transporter OATP2B1 (human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1) and the efflux transporters, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP4, and MRP5 are expressed on the sarcolemmal membrane of human skeletal muscle fibers and that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are substrates of these transporters when assessed using a heterologous expression system. In an in vitro model of differentiated, primary human skeletal muscle myoblast cells, we demonstrate basal membrane expression and drug efflux activity of MRP1, which contributes to reducing intracellular statin accumulation. Furthermore, we show that expression of human OATP2B1 in human skeletal muscle myoblast cells by adenoviral vectors increases intracellular accumulation and toxicity of statins and such effects were abrogated when cells overexpressed MRP1. These results identify key membrane transporters as modulators of skeletal muscle statin exposure and toxicity.",

Clinically, muscular side effects manifest as fatigue, myalgias, persistent or transient weakness, stiffness, intolerance to exercise, psychomotor slowing, muscle cramps, wasting, dyspnea, dysphagia, fasciculations, reduced tendon reflexes, impaired consciousness, myoglobinuria, renal failure, or hyperthermia. Diagnosis of these drug-induced myopathies is based on history, clinical neurologic examination, blood work, urine analysis, repetitive stimulation, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. A drug which induces muscular side effects should never be given again. Particularly in patients suffering from primary myopathy, myotoxic drugs should be applied with caution. The drugs which most frequently induce muscular side effects are steroids, statins, fibrates, antiretrovirals, immunosuppressants, colchicine, amiodarone, and anticancer drugs. Many drugs exhibit their myotoxic potential only in combination with other drugs or premorbid pathologic myogenic conditions.",

He was started on rosuvastatin 40 mg (0-0-1) along with dual anti-platelets post angioplasty and was discharged home. He traveled back to his hometown and noticed progressive symmetric muscle weakness with decreased urine output. After visiting another hospital he presented to us with severe proximal muscle weakness and acute renal failure. Laboratory investigations were initiated which demonstrated clinically significant derangement in serum creatinine phosphokinase, serum creatinine, urine myoglobin along with deranged liver enzymes. He was subjected to nerve conduction studies for his muscle weakness which was normal and electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous muscle activity in all examined muscles (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and pseudomyotonic discharges) suggestive of an irritable myopathy. The medication was stopped and he was treated with eight cycles of hemodialysis until his muscle weakness and laboratory parameters improved.

They have been seen after the introduction of modern lipid-lowering drugs more regularly. The first description after medication with clofibrate dates back to 1968. Apparently, all fibrates can induce myopathy. It usually starts after a few days of medication, or after prolonged use, showing muscle weakness and/or pain. Concomitantly, the enzyme creatininephosphokinase (CPK) is raised dramatically. Muscular necrosis can follow leading secondarily to kidney failure, and eventually to death. For the class of statins, myopathy was more often seen after their introduction, and it became their most feared adverse effect, especially in combination of statins with other drugs (mibefradil, gemfibrozil, cyclosporin). In animal models the evolution of the disease and the mechanism of action may be elucidated. Though strong epidemiological data are lacking, the incidence of myopathy is probably similar for all lipid-lowering drugs and is in the range of 0.1-0.5% with monotherapy, increasing to 0.5-2.5% with combination therapy. Severe cases of rhabdomyolysis are rarer, but may have a significant mortality. The market success of cerivastatin within a short period has led to 100s of myopathies and some dozens of deaths. Though interactions on metabolism and ensuing high plasma levels can partially explain myopathy as intoxication, there are strong indications that other (endocrine, metabolic, genetic) factors might play a role in the pathophysiology. The patient population at risk should better be defined and withheld from myopathy-inducing drugs.",

Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed. Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function. Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.",

Predisposing factors to the development of myopathy from the combination include use of medications affecting statin metabolism, higher doses of statins, renal insufficiency, diuretics, and hypothyroidism. It has been proposed that alternate-day therapy with a statin and fibrate, spacing of doses in a single day, or use of lower doses of statins may prevent the development of myopathy. Currently, no predictable method to determine who is at risk for myopathy exists, nor is there a reliable screening test.

Nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), central to the proinflammatory cascade, is activated in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating condition of intestinal injury with extensive inflammation in premature infants. TGF-\u03b2 is a strong immune suppressor and a factor in breast milk, which has been shown to be protective against NEC. In an NEC animal model, oral administration of the isoform TGF-\u03b21 activated the downstream effector Smad2 in intestine and significantly reduced NEC incidence. In addition, TGF-\u03b21 suppressed NF-\u03baB activation, maintained levels of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 in the intestinal epithelium, and systemically decreased serum levels of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3. The immature human fetal intestinal epithelial cell line H4 was used as a reductionistic model of the immature enterocyte to investigate mechanism. TGF-\u03b21 pretreatment inhibited the TNF-\u03b1-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation that targets the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein for degradation and inhibited NF-\u03baB activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated decreased NF-\u03baB binding to the promoters of IL-6, IL-8, and I\u03baB\u03b1 in response to TNF-\u03b1 with TGF-\u03b21 pretreatment. These TGF-\u03b21 effects appear to be mediated through the canonical Smad pathway as silencing of the TGF-\u03b2 central mediator Smad4 resulted in loss of the TGF-\u03b21 effects. Thus, TGF-\u03b21 is capable of eliciting anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-\u03baB specifically in the intestinal epithelium as well as by decreasing systemic IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Oral administration of TGF-\u03b21 therefore can potentially be used to protect against gastrointestinal diseases.",

The TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway outcome relies on the control of the spatial and temporal expression of &gt;500 genes, which depend on the functions of the Smad protein along with those of diverse modulators of this signaling pathway, such as transcriptional factors and cofactors. Ski (Sloan-Kettering Institute) and SnoN (Ski novel) are Smad-interacting proteins that negatively regulate the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway by disrupting the formation of R-Smad/Smad4 complexes, as well as by inhibiting Smad association with the p300/CBP coactivators. The Ski and SnoN transcriptional cofactors recruit diverse corepressors and histone deacetylases to repress gene transcription. The TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway and coregulators Ski and SnoN clearly regulate each other through several positive and negative feedback mechanisms. Thus, these cross-regulatory processes finely modify the TGF-\u03b2 signaling outcome as they control the magnitude and duration of the TGF-\u03b2 signals. As a result, any alteration in these regulatory mechanisms may lead to disease development. Therefore, the design of targeted therapies to exert tight control of the levels of negative modulators of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, such as Ski and SnoN, is critical to restore cell homeostasis under the specific pathological conditions in which these cofactors are deregulated, such as fibrosis and cancer.",

Prior to stimulation with TGF\u2011\u03b21 (10 ng/ml), HIFs were treated with or without PFD (1 mg/ml). Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit (CCK)\u20118 and colony formation assays, and cell apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry and a TUNEL assay. Reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to evaluate the mRNA and protein expressions of \u03b1\u2011smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2011SMA), collagen I and fibronectin.

Flow cytometry and TUNEL assays revealed that PFD treatment significantly enhanced apoptosis in TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011stimulated HIFs. In addition, PFD markedly reduced TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced HIF activities, such as myofibroblast differentiation (\u03b1\u2011SMA), and collagen production (collagen I and fibronectin).

Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) delays internalization of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) and subsequently enhances cellular signaling. This study investigated the effect of TGF\u03b21 on SIGIRR protein production by human M1 macrophages in response to stimulation with substance P (SP). SP caused upregulation of SIGIRR expression in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas aprepitant (an NK1R inhibitor) blunted this response. Silencing p38\u03b3MAPK or TAK-1 partially attenuated the response to SP stimulation, while TGF\u03b21/2/3 siRNA dramatically diminished it. SP induced much greater SIGIRR protein production than either lipopolysaccharide (a TLR4 agonist) or resiquimod (a TLR7/8 agonist). Unexpectedly, silencing of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) led to significant upregulation of SIGIRR expression after SP stimulation, while KLF2 siRNA only partially enhanced it and Fli-1 siRNA reduced it. SP also upregulated TGF\u03b21 expression, along with a corresponding increase of SIGIRR protein, whereas silencing TGF\u03b21/2/3 blunted these responses. Sp1 siRNA or mithramycin (a gene-selective Sp1 inhibitor) significantly enhanced the expression of TGF\u03b21 and SIGIRR by macrophages after SP stimulation. Importantly, this effect of Sp1 siRNA on TGF\u03b21 and SIGIRR was blunted by siRNA for Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4, but not by TAK-1 siRNA. Next, we investigated the influence of transcription factor cross-talk on SIGIRR expression in response to SP. Co-transfection of macrophages with Sp1 siRNA and C/EBP\u03b2 or TIF1\u03b2 siRNA attenuated the upregulation of SIGIRR by SP, while a combination of Sp1 siRNA and Fli-1 siRNA dramatically diminished it. In conclusion, TGF\u03b21 may be an intermediary between SP/NK1R activation and SIGIRR expression in Sp1 siRNA-transfected macrophages. In addition, Sp1 modulates TGF\u03b21/Smad signaling and negatively regulates SIGIRR protein production by macrophages after SP stimulation.",

Here, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates the proliferation, angiogenesis, and acquisition of GSC characteristics by inducing inhibitor of differentiation 3 (ID3) and ID3-regulated cytokines [GRO1 and interleukins (IL)-6 and 8] induction. We found that EGFR-mediated ID3 expression was regulated by Smad5, which was directly phosphorylated by AKT. Furthermore, ID3 alone imparted GSC features to primary astrocytes derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mouse, and EGFR-ID3-IL-6 signaling axis gave rise to tumor cell heterogeneity. Conversely, EGFR inhibitors suppressed EGFR-AKT-Smad5-driven induction of ID3, which led to a decrease in the tumorsphere forming ability of GSCs and U87MG cells that possess an active mutant EGFR, EGFRvIII, without obvious cytotoxic effects. However, these cells seemed to regain colonogenic ability after removal of the EGFR inhibitors. Together, the results delineate a novel integrative molecular mechanism in which the RTK-ID signaling pathway governs genesis and maintenance of GBM histopathologic features, such as GSCs-based tumor initiation, progression, and angiogenesis.",

Numerous studies have shown that TGF-\u03b2 is the most important cytokine in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and plays a role through its downstream signaling molecule TGF-binding receptor Smads protein. In this paper, compounds bearing 2(1H)-quinolone scaffold were designed and their anti-fibrosis effects were evaluated. Of these compounds, 20f was identified as the most active one and could inhibit TGF-\u03b2-induced collagen deposition of NRK-49F cells and mouse fibroblasts migration with comparable activity and lower cytotoxicity than nintedanib in vitro. Further mechanism studies indicated that 20f reduced the expression of fibrogenic phenotypic protein \u03b1-SMA and collagen \u2160 by inhibiting the TGF-\u03b2/Smad dependent pathways and ERK1/2 and p38 pathways. Moreover, compared with the nintedanib, 20f (100 mg/kg/day, p.o) more effectively alleviated collagen deposition in lung tissue and delayed the destruction of lung tissue structure both in bleomycin-induced prevention and treatment mice pulmonary fibrosis models. The immunohistochemical experiments further showed that 20f could block the expression level of phosphorylated Smad3 in the lung tissue cells, which resulted in its anti-fibrosis effects in vivo. In addition, 20f demonstrated good bioavailability (F = 41.55% vs 12%, compare with nintedanib) and an appropriate elimination half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.5 h), suggesting that 20f may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",

Our aim was to study whether the regulation of MUC4 expression by TGF-beta in pancreatic cancer cells was strictly dependent on Smad4 activity. Three pancreatic cancer cell lines, CAPAN-1 (MUC4+/Smad4-), CAPAN-2 (MUC4+/Smad4+) and PANC-1 (MUC4-/Smad4+), were used. By RT-PCR, transfection assays and immunohistochemistry, we show that (i) both MUC4 mRNA and apomucin expression are upregulated by TGF-beta, (ii) Smad2 positively cooperates with Smad4 to activate the promoter, (iii) activation of Smad4 by exogenous TGF-beta induces Smad4 binding to the promoter, (iv) Smad7 and c-ski both inhibit activation by Smad4. When Smad4 is mutated and inactive, TGF-beta activates MUC4 expression via MAPK, PI3K and PKA signaling pathways. Absence of expression in PANC-1 cells is due to histone deacetylation.

R-Smads activated by BMPs induce expression of Id proteins, which act as inhibitors of differentiation and stimulators of cell growth by inhibiting the function of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. In endothelial cells, TGF-beta binds to two distinct type I receptor serine-threonine kinases, ALK-5 and ALK-1; the latter activates the same R-Smads that are activated by BMP and induces synthesis of Id (inhibitor of differentiation or inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins.

TGF\u03b2 signaling is required for the efficient differentiation and maintenance of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells that inhibit immune responses. Conversely, in conjunction with the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, TGF\u03b2 promotes Th17 cell differentiation. The mechanism by which TGF\u03b2 signals synergize with IL-6 to generate inflammatory versus immunosuppressive T cell subsets is unclear. TGF\u03b2 signaling activates receptor SMADs, SMAD2 and SMAD3, which associate with a variety of nuclear factors to regulate gene transcription. Defining relative contributions of distinct SMAD molecules for CD4 T cell differentiation is critical for mapping the versatile intracellular TGF\u03b2-signaling pathways that tailor TGF\u03b2 activities to the state of host interaction with pathogens. We show here that SMAD2 is essential for Th17 cell differentiation and that it acts in part by modulating the expression of IL-6R on T cells. Although mice lacking SMAD2 specifically in T cells do not develop spontaneous lymphoproliferative autoimmunity, Smad2-deficient T cells are impaired in their response to TGF\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo, and they are more pathogenic than controls when transferred into lymphopenic mice.

We demonstrate that exogenous TGF-beta(1) can inhibit the expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecule, E-selectin, in vascular endothelium exposed to inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. This inhibitory effect occurs at the level of transcription of the E-selectin gene and is dependent on the action of Smad proteins, a class of intracellular signaling proteins involved in mediating the cellular effects of TGF-beta(1). Furthermore, we demonstrate that these Smad-mediated effects in endothelial cells result from a novel competitive interaction between Smad proteins activated by TGF-beta(1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) proteins activated by inflammatory stimuli (such as cytokines or bacterial lipopolysaccharide) that is mediated by the transcriptional coactivator cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP). Augmentation of the limited amount of CBP present in endothelial cells (via overexpression) or selective disruption of Smad-CBP interactions (via a dominant negative strategy) effectively antagonizes the ability of TGF-beta(1) to block proinflammatory E-selectin expression. These data thus demonstrate a novel mechanism of interaction between TGF-beta(1)-regulated Smad proteins and NFkappaB proteins regulated by inflammatory stimuli in vascular endothelial cells.

In the well-understood classical TGF-beta signaling pathway, TGF-beta activates Smad signalling via its two cell surface receptors such as TbetaRII and ALK5/TbetaRI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, TGF-beta may also activate other signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K, etc. The signaling of TGF-beta is finely regulated at different levels. Inhibitory Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, are key regulators of TGF-beta/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by negative feedback loops. They can form stable complexes with activated type I receptors and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads, or recruit ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as Smurf1/2, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated type I receptors. Besides, these inhibitory Smad proteins also inhibit TGF-beta/BMP signaling in the nucleus by interacting with transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases, Hoxc-8, and CtBP, or disrupting the formation of the TGF-beta-induced functional Smad-DNA complexes. Smad7 is in turn regulated by different stimuli, including TGF-beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha as well as ultraviolet and TPA, and mediates the crosstalk between TGF-beta and other signaling pathways. Deregulation of Smad7 expression has been associated with various human diseases, such as tissue fibrosis, inflammatory disease as well as carcinogenesis.

Here, we present evidence that TGF-beta inhibits fetal human skin fibroblasts, while it is stimulatory for adult ones. This proliferative effect of TGF-beta was found to be concentration- dependent, but isoform-independent. Furthermore, even a transient exposure of the cells to this growth factor was sufficient to exert its stimulatory or inhibitory action. Accordingly, we have studied the immediate responses provoked by TGF-beta in major signaling pathways, and we have found that it induces a rapid activation of the SMAD pathway, i.e., phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2, followed by dephosphorylation, most probably due to degradation by the proteasome. However, similar intensity and kinetics of this activation have been observed in both fetal and adult fibroblasts. On the other hand, curcumin, a natural product with wound healing properties that inhibits several intracellular signaling pathways, was found to completely abrogate the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on human fetal skin fibroblasts, without affecting the stimulatory action on fibroblasts from adult donors.

We hereby show that TGF-beta1 induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state in mature hepatocytes in vitro. EMT state was marked by significant upregulation of alpha(1)(I) collagen mRNA expression and type I collagen deposition. Similar changes were found in a \"normal\" mouse hepatocyte cell line (AML12), thus confirming that hepatocytes are capable of EMT changes and type I collagen synthesis. We also show that in hepatocytes in the EMT state, TGF-beta1 induces the snail-1 transcription factor and activates the Smad2/3 pathway. Evidence for a central role of the TGF-beta1/Smad pathway is further supported by the inhibition of EMT by Smad4 silencing using small interference RNA technology. In conclusion, TGF-beta1, a known pro-apoptotic cytokine in mature hepatocytes, is capable of mediating phenotypic changes and plasticity in the form of EMT, resulting in collagen deposition.

We show that TGF-beta receptor Type II is predominantly present in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. TGF-beta1 induces a time-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 and co-immunoprecipitation of SMAD-2 with Smad-4 and its subsequently translocation to the nucleus. We show that pretreatment of cells with TGF-beta1 is associated with a down-regulation of IL-6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and suppression of ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 pretreatment resulted in a significant inhibition of IL-6 induced ICAM-1 promoter activity.

Since TGF-beta is neuroprotective, whereas Alzheimer's disease is typified by neurodegeneration, we speculated that defects in TGF-beta signaling might abrogate its neuroprotective properties. Consistently with an increase in TGF-beta in Alzheimer's disease, we found significant increases in phospho-Smad2, a major downstream signaling molecule of TGF-beta, in hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer's disease compared with age-matched control patients. However, in contrast to an expected nuclear localization, phosphorylated Smad2 in Alzheimer's disease was predominantly, and ectopically, found in the neuronal cytoplasm, specifically colocalized with neurofibrillary tangles and granulovacuolar degeneration. Given that a nuclear localization is required to regulate the transcription of TGF-beta target genes to afford neuroprotection, the ectopic localization of phosphorylated Smad2 suggests a defect in the Smad-mediated signaling pathway of TGF-beta in Alzheimer's disease and consequent loss of neuroprotective function.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10611754": "In the past three years, a novel signal transduction pathway downstream of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily receptor serine-threonine kinases has been shown to be mediated by a family of latent transcription factors called 'Smads'. These proteins mediate a short-circuited pathway in which a set of receptor-activated Smads are phosphorylated directly by the receptor kinase and then translocate to the nucleus complexed to the common mediator, Smad4, to participate in transcriptional complexes. Smads 2 and 3 mediate signals predominantly from the TGF-beta receptors. Of these, specific roles have been ascribed to Smad3 in control of chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages and the inhibition of Smad3 activity by the oncogene Evi-1 suggests that it may play a role in leukemogenesis. Other data, such as the induction by the inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma of an inhibitory Smad, Smad7, which blocks the actions of Smad3, suggest that identification of the specific gene targets of Smad proteins in immune cells will provide new insight into the mechanisms of TGF-beta action on these cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603212": "Chronic inflammation plays an important role in the initiation and progression of various human diseases including benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer. Here we show that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has prosurvival effects and chronically activates the Jak2/STAT3 signalling pathway in a model of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-1). We demonstrate that the antiinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which also permanently activates its canonical signalling pathway through SMAD proteins in BPH-1 cells, modifies the effects of IL-6 on cell proliferation. Importantly, TGF-beta1 inhibits IL-6 signal transduction by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT3. This effect is associated with decreased expression of Jak2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we showed that TGF-beta1 inhibits IL-6-induced expression of the cancer-associated gene MUC1. These observations demonstrated a novel interaction between TGF-beta1 and IL-6 signalling and suggested another mechanism of how defects in TGF-beta signalling, frequently associated with prostate pathologies, can contribute to the disruption of tissue homeostasis.",

Both transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), the most potent fibrogenic cytokine for HSCs, which classically activates Smad signaling, and p38 MAPK signaling have been shown to influence collagen gene expression; however, the relative contribution and mechanisms that these two signaling pathways have in regulating collagen gene expression have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative roles and mechanisms of both Smad and p38 MAPK signaling in alpha1(I) collagen gene expression in HSCs. Inhibiting either p38 MAPK or Smad signaling reduced alpha1(I) collagen mRNA expression in untreated or TGF-beta-treated HSCs, and when both signaling pathways were simultaneously inhibited, alpha1(I) collagen gene expression was essentially blocked. Both signaling pathways were found to independently and additively increase alpha1(I) collagen gene expression by transcriptional mechanisms. TGF-beta treatment increased alpha1(I) collagen mRNA half-life, mediated by increased stability of alpha1(I) collagen mRNA through p38 MAPK signaling but not through Smad signaling. In conclusion, both p38 MAPK and Smad signaling independently and additively regulate alpha1(I) collagen gene expression by transcriptional activation, whereas p38 MAPK and not Smad signaling increased alpha1(I) collagen mRNA stability.",

Various factors contribute to maintain immune homeostasis and diminished production and/or function of such molecules trigger and/or propagate detrimental signals, which can eventually lead to chronic colitis and colon cancer. One such a molecule is transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), a cytokine produced by many inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells and targeting virtually all the intestinal mucosal cell types, with the down-stream effect of activating intracellular Smad2/3 proteins and suppressing immune reactions. In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), there is defective TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling due to high Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-\u03b21 activity. Indeed, knockdown of Smad7 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide restores endogenous TGF-\u03b21 activity, thereby inhibiting inflammatory pathways in patients with IBD and colitic mice. Consistently, mice over-expressing Smad7 in T cells develop severe intestinal inflammation in various experimental models. Smad7 expression is also upregulated in colon cancer cells, in which such a protein controls positively intracellular pathways that sustain neoplastic cell growth and survival. We here review the role of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad7 in intestinal immunity, inflammation, and cancer.",

It mediates homophilic interaction between germ cells and heterophilic interaction between Sertoli and germ cells. Knockout studies have shown that loss of Necl-2 causes male infertility, suggesting Necl-2-based cell adhesion is crucial for spermatogenesis. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2s (TGF-\u03b2s) are crucial for regulating cell junction restructuring that are required for spermatogenesis. In the present study, we aim to investigate the mechanism on how TGF-\u03b21 regulates Necl-2 expression to achieve timely junction restructuring in the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis. We have demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 reduces Necl-2 mRNA and protein levels at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Using inhibitor and clathrin shRNA, we have revealed that TGF-\u03b21 induces Necl-2 protein degradation via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Endocytosis assays further confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 accelerates the internalization of Necl-2 protein to cytosol. Immunofluorescence staining also revealed that TGF-\u03b21 effectively removes Necl-2 from cell-cell interface. In addition, TGF-\u03b21 reduces Necl-2 mRNA via down-regulating Necl-2 promoter activity. Mutational studies coupled with knockdown experiments have shown that TGF-\u03b21-induced Necl-2 repression requires activation of Smad proteins. EMSA and ChIP assays further confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 promotes the binding of Smad proteins onto MyoD and CCAATa motifs in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, TGF-\u03b21 is a potent cytokine that provides an effective mechanism in controlling Necl-2 expression in the testis via Smad-dependent gene repression and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18322180": "Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is an important negative regulator for cytokines; however, the role of SOCS1 in Th17 differentiation has not been clarified. We generated T cell-specific SOCS1-deficient mice and found that these mice were extremely resistant to a Th17-dependent autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. SOCS1-deficient naive CD4(+) T cells were predominantly differentiated into Th1 and poorly into Th17 in vitro. These phenotypes were canceled in IFN-gamma(-/-) background, suggesting that a large amount of IFN-gamma in SOCS1-deficient T cells suppressed Th17 differentiation. IL-6 plus TGF-beta enhanced retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat expression and suppressed IFN-gamma production in wild-type T cells, whereas these effects were severely impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. These phenotypes can be partly explained by STAT3 suppression by enhanced SOCS3 induction through hyper-STAT1 activation in SOCS1-deficient T cells. In addition, SOCS1-deficient T cells were much less sensitive to TGF-beta. Suppression of Th1 differentiation by TGF-beta was impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. TGF-beta-mediated Smad transcriptional activity was severely inhibited in SOCS1-deficient cells in the presence of IFN-gamma. Such impairment of TGF-beta functions were not observed in SOCS3-overexpressed cells, indicating that suppression of Smads was independent of SOCS3. Therefore, SOCS1 is necessary for Th17 differentiation by suppressing antagonistic effect of IFN-gamma on both STAT3 and Smads. Induction of SOCS3 can partly explain IFN-gamma-mediated STAT3 suppression, while other mechanism(s) will be involved in IFN-gamma-mediated Smad suppression. SOCS1-deficient T cells will be very useful to investigate the molecular mechanism for the STAT1-mediated suppression of Th17 development.",

In some cases, activins also signal via the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor ALK2, causing activation of the SMAD1/5/8 pathway. In this study, we aimed to dissect how activin A and activin B homodimers, and activin AB and AC heterodimers activate the two main SMAD branches. We compared the activin-induced signaling dynamics of ALK4/7-SMAD2/3 and ALK2-SMAD1/5 in a multiple myeloma cell line. Signaling via the ALK2-SMAD1/5 pathway exhibited greater differences between ligands than signaling via ALK4/ALK7-SMAD2/3. Interestingly, activin B and activin AB very potently activated SMAD1/5, resembling the activation commonly seen with BMPs. As SMAD1/5 was also activated by activins in other cell types, we propose that dual specificity is a general mechanism for activin ligands. In addition, we found that the antagonist follistatin inhibited signaling by all the tested activins, whereas the antagonist cerberus specifically inhibited activin B. Taken together, we propose that activins may be considered dual specificity TGF-\u03b2 family members, critically affecting how activins may be considered and targeted clinically.",

TGF-\u03b2 signals through receptors to activate Smad proteins, which translocate into the nucleus. In the present study, we investigated the chronological alterations and cellular locations of the TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway following spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. ELISA analysis showed that the concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in injured spinal cords significantly increases immediately after SCI, while the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 gradually increased after SCI, peaked at 2 days, and then gradually decreased. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that Smad3 was mainly expressed in neurons of the spinal cord. Phosphorylated Smad3 at the C-terminus (p-Smad3C) was stained within the motor neurons in the anterior horn, while phosphorylated Smad3 at the linker regions (p-Smad3L) was expressed in astrocytes within gray matter. These findings suggest that SCI induces gradual increases in TGF-\u03b2 and induces different activation of p-Smad3C and p-Smad3L. Phosphorylated Smad3C might be involved in neuronal degeneration after SCI, and p-Smad3L may play a role in glial scar formation by astrocytes.",

The cytoplasm-to-nucleus redistribution of Smads, as well as the ability of Smads to activate or repress gene transcription, is under multiple layers of regulation by factors not limited to TGF-beta.

Canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling results in the activation of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors that regulate target gene expression. We found that the cell surface molecule platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) facilitated noncanonical (Smad-independent) TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells. Subcutaneously injected tumor cells that are dependent on TGF-\u03b2-mediated suppression of immunity for growth grew more slowly in PECAM-1(-/-) mice than in their wild-type counterparts. T cells isolated from PECAM-1(-/-) mice demonstrated relative insensitivity to the TGF-\u03b2-dependent inhibition of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production, granzyme B synthesis, and cellular proliferation. Similarly, human T cells lacking PECAM-1 demonstrated decreased sensitivity to TGF-\u03b2 in a manner that was partially restored by reexpression of PECAM-1. Co-incubation of T cells with TGF-\u03b2 and a T cell-activating antibody resulted in PECAM-1 phosphorylation on an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the recruitment of the inhibitory Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2). Such conditions also induced the colocalization of PECAM-1 with the TGF-\u03b2 receptor complex as identified by coimmunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and proximity ligation assays. These studies indicate a role for PECAM-1 in enhancing the inhibitory functions of TGF-\u03b2 in T cells and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the PECAM-1-TGF-\u03b2 inhibitory axis represents a means to overcome TGF-\u03b2-dependent immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment.",

TGF-beta and related peptides are multifunctional growth factors and they regulate many aspects of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and apoptosis. These evolutionarily conserved cytokines play an essential role in the development and homeostasis of virtually every tissue in organisms ranging from fruit flies to humans. Accordingly, inactivating mutations in several components of the TGF-beta signaling pathways have been found to cause a number of human disorders. The TGF-beta family members signal through cell surface serine/threonine kinase receptors. A family of proteins, designated as Smads (mammalian homologues of Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma), transduces the TGF-beta signal from cell surface to the nucleus. Upon activation, the TGF-beta type I receptor phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, which then form complexes with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate transcription of a variety of genes that encode crucial determinants of cell fate, such as cell cycle components, differentiation factors and cell adhesion molecules. Although Smad2 and Smad3 are highly homologous and share some overlapping activities, they have distinct functions and are regulated differentially. This review is primarily focused on our understanding of the similar as well as distinct function and regulation of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-beta signaling, their physiological roles revealed by knockout studies and their tumor suppressive functions.",

One of the central players in this process is the pleiotropic cytokine transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), whose deficiency results in spontaneous systemic autoimmunity in mice. The dominant function of TGF-\u03b2 is to regulate the peripheral immune homeostasis, particularly in the microbe-rich and antigen-rich environment of the gut. To maintain intestinal integrity, the epithelial cells, myeloid cells and lymphocytes that inhabit the gut secrete TGF-\u03b2, which acts in both paracrine and autocrine fashions to activate its signal transducers, the SMAD transcription factors. The SMAD pathway regulates the production of IgA by B cells, maintains the protective mucosal barrier and promotes the balanced differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into inflammatory T helper type 17 cells and suppressive FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells. While encounters with pathogenic microbes activate SMAD proteins to evoke a protective inflammatory immune response, SMAD activation and synergism with immunoregulatory factors such as the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid enforce immunosuppression toward commensal microbes and innocuous food antigens. Such complementary context-dependent functions of TGF-\u03b2 are achieved by the co-operation of SMAD proteins with distinct dominant transcription activators and accessory chromatin modifiers. This review highlights recent advances in unravelling the molecular basis for the multi-faceted functions of TGF-\u03b2 in the gut that are dictacted by fluid orchestrations of SMADs and their myriad partners.",

Termination of Smad-activated transcription involves Smad dephosphorylation, nuclear export, or ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In an unbiased proteomic screen, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a Smad-interacting partner. PARP-1 dissociates Smad complexes from DNA by ADP-ribosylating Smad3 and Smad4, which attenuates Smad-specific gene responses and TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, our results identify ADP-ribosylation of Smad proteins by PARP-1 as a key step in controlling the strength and duration of Smad-mediated transcription.",

Here, we show that S1P also induces phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling device. However, Smad phosphorylation occurred more slowly with a maximal effect after 20-30 min of S1P stimulation when compared with the rapid activation of the MAPKs. Interestingly, Smad phosphorylation is increased by pertussis toxin, which is in contrast to the complete inhibition of S1P-induced MAPK phosphorylation by pertussis toxin. TGF-beta is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, which in mesangial cells attenuates the expression of (i) inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS) caused by interleukin (IL)-1beta, (ii) secreted phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)), and (iii) matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). These gene products are also down-regulated by S1P in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of connective tissue growth factor is enhanced by both TGF-beta(2) and S1P. These effects of S1P are not mediated by the MAPK cascade as neither pertussis toxin nor the MAPK cascade inhibitor U0126 are able to reverse this inhibition. Overexpression of the inhibitory Smad-7 or down-regulation of co-Smad-4 lead to a reversal of the blocking effect of S1P on IL-1beta-induced NO release. Moreover, down-regulating the TGF-beta receptor type II by the siRNA technique or antagonizing the S1P(3) receptor subtype with suramin abrogates S1P-stimulated Smad phosphorylation. In summary, our data show that S1P trans-activates the TGF-beta receptor and triggers activation of Smads followed by activation of connective tissue growth factor gene transcription and inhibition of IL-1beta-induced expression of iNOS, sPLA(2), and MMP-9.",

Mitochondrial malfunction needs to be relayed to the cytosol, where an integrated stress response is triggered by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) in mammalian cells<sup>4,5</sup>. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is mediated by the four eIF2\u03b1 kinases GCN2, HRI, PERK and PKR, which are activated by diverse types of cellular stress<sup>6</sup>. However, the machinery that communicates mitochondrial perturbation to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response remains unknown<sup>1,2,7</sup>. Here we combine genome engineering and haploid genetics to unbiasedly identify genes that affect the induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key factor in the integrated stress response. We show that the mitochondrial protease OMA1 and the poorly characterized protein DELE1, together with HRI, constitute the missing pathway that is triggered by mitochondrial stress. Mechanistically, stress-induced activation of OMA1 causes DELE1 to be cleaved into a short form that accumulates in the cytosol, where it binds to and activates HRI via its C-terminal portion. Obstruction of this pathway can be beneficial or adverse depending on the type of mitochondrial perturbation. In addition to the core pathway components, our comparative genetic screening strategy identifies a suite of additional regulators. Together, these findings could be used to inform future strategies to modulate the cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of human disease.",

However, how mitochondrial stress is relayed to ATF4 is unknown. Here we show that HRI is the eIF2\u03b1 kinase that is necessary and sufficient for this relay. In a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified factors upstream of HRI: OMA1, a mitochondrial stress-activated protease; and DELE1, a little-characterized protein that we found was associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial stress stimulates OMA1-dependent cleavage of DELE1 and leads to the accumulation of DELE1 in the cytosol, where it interacts with HRI and activates the eIF2\u03b1 kinase activity of HRI. In addition, DELE1 is required for ATF4 translation downstream of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Blockade of the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway triggers an alternative response in which specific molecular chaperones are induced. The OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway therefore represents a potential therapeutic target that could enable fine-tuning of the integrated stress response for beneficial outcomes in diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Motile cilia play a central role in establishing fluid flow in the respiratory tract, reproductive tract, brain ventricles and ear. Genetic defects affecting the structure or function of cilia can lead to a broad range of developmental and degenerative diseases known as ciliopathies. Splicing contributes to the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of ciliopathies. Tissue-specific alternative splicing contributes to the tissue-specific manifestation of ciliopathy phenotypes, for example the retinal-specific effects of some genetic defects, due to specific transcript expression in the highly specialised ciliated cells of the retina, the photoreceptor cells. Ciliopathies can arise both as a result of genetic variants in spliceosomal proteins, or as a result of variants affecting splicing of specific cilia genes.

However, recent studies have uncovered that the cilium is dynamically organized organelle in a cell cycle-dependent manner; it is formed during G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase and resorbed when the cells enter cell division cycle. Despite the primary cilium is very short and its surface area is extremely small, the cilium possesses a few kinds of G protein-coupled receptors, growth factor receptors and ion channels. Therefore, it can function as a signaling receptor for selective bioactive ligands and mechanical stresses. Dysregulation of the ciliary dynamics is linked with hereditary disorders, so called \"ciliopathy\", with clinical manifestations of microcephaly, polycystic kidney, situs inversus, polydactyly, and so on. No effective medical treatment for the ciliopathies has been available. Increasing evidences about the molecular mechanisms of ciliary dynamics and ciliary functions have revealed that enormous number of molecules regulate a cycle of ciliogenesis, cilium-derived signaling, ciliary resorption and elimination. However, it is a fact that research progress is far inferior to the full disclosure of the molecular mechanisms. Further studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis of the cilipathies.

In order to understand the full course of primary cilia and its association with ADPKD, the structure, functions and role of primary cilia have been meticulously investigated. As a result, the focus on primary cilia has emerged to support the vital roles of primary cilia in ADPKD. The primary cilia have been shown to have not only a mechanosensory function but also a chemosensory function. Both structural and functional defects in primary cilia result in cystic kidney disease and vascular hypertension.

Renal cystic diseases are the most frequently observed symptoms in ciliopathies. Cilia are microtubule-based organelles with the following regions: a ciliary tip, shaft, transitional zone and basal body/mother centriole. Joubert syndrome (JBTS), Meckel Gruber syndrome (MKS) and Nephronophthisis (NPHP) are overlapping syndromes. Recent studies show that JBST and MKS responsible gene products are localized in the transitional zone of the cilia, where they function as a diffusion barrier, and control protein sorting and ciliary membrane composition. Nephrocystins are gene products of NPHP responsible genes, and at least 11 genes have been identified. Although some nephrocystins interact with JBST and MKS proteins, proteomic analysis suggests that they do not form a single complex. Localization analysis reveals that nephrocystins can be divided into two groups. Group I nephrocystins are localized in the transitional zone, whereas group II nephrocystins are localized in the Inv compartment. Homologs of group I nephrocystins, but not group II nephrocystins, have been reported in C. reinhardtii and C. elegans.

However, none of these ciliogenic genes has been linked to ciliopathy, a group of disorders caused by abnormal formation or function of cilia. To determine whether there is a genetic and molecular link between ciliopathies and skin morphogenesis, we investigated the role of RPGRIP1L, a gene mutated in Joubert (JBTS) and Meckel (MKS) syndromes, two severe forms of ciliopathy, in the context of skin development. We found that RPGRIP1L is essential for hair follicle morphogenesis. Specifically, disrupting the Rpgrip1l gene in mice resulted in reduced proliferation and differentiation of follicular keratinocytes, leading to hair follicle developmental defects. These defects were associated with significantly decreased primary cilium formation and attenuated hedgehog signaling. In contrast, we found that hair follicle induction and polarization and the development of interfollicular epidermis were unaffected.

Individual genes can be linked to ciliopathies with dramatically different phenotypes, suggesting that genetic modifiers may participate in their pathogenesis. The ciliary transition zone contains two protein complexes affected in the ciliopathies Meckel syndrome (MKS) and nephronophthisis (NPHP). The BBSome is a third protein complex, affected in the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). We tested whether mutations in MKS, NPHP and BBS complex genes modify the phenotypic consequences of one another in both C. elegans and mice. To this end, we identified TCTN-1, the C. elegans ortholog of vertebrate MKS complex components called Tectonics, as an evolutionarily conserved transition zone protein. Neither disruption of TCTN-1 alone or together with MKS complex components abrogated ciliary structure in C. elegans. In contrast, disruption of TCTN-1 together with either of two NPHP complex components, NPHP-1 or NPHP-4, compromised ciliary structure. Similarly, disruption of an NPHP complex component and the BBS complex component BBS-5 individually did not compromise ciliary structure, but together did. As in nematodes, disrupting two components of the mouse MKS complex did not cause additive phenotypes compared to single mutants. However, disrupting both Tctn1 and either Nphp1 or Nphp4 exacerbated defects in ciliogenesis and cilia-associated developmental signaling, as did disrupting both Tctn1 and the BBSome component Bbs1. Thus, we demonstrate that ciliary complexes act in parallel to support ciliary function and suggest that human ciliopathy phenotypes are altered by genetic interactions between different ciliary biochemical complexes.",

These disorders share common clinical and radiological features. The clinical hallmarks comprise thoracic hypoplasia with respiratory failure, body disproportion with a normal trunk length and short limbs, and severely short digits occasionally accompanied by polydactyly. Reflecting the clinical features, the radiological hallmarks consist of a narrow thorax caused by extremely short ribs, normal or only mildly affected spine, shortening of the tubular bones, and severe brachydactyly with or without polydactyly. Other radiological clues include trident ilia/pelvis and cone-shaped epiphysis.

The last decade has seen an increase in potential curative therapeutic options including small molecules and biologics. Recent work in multiciliated olfactory sensory neurons has demonstrated the capacity of targeted gene therapy to restore ciliation in terminally differentiated cells and rescue olfactory function. This review will discuss the current understanding of the penetrance of ciliopathies in the olfactory system. Importantly, it will highlight both pharmacological and biological approaches, and their potential therapeutic value in the olfactory system and other ciliated tissues. We undertook a structured and comprehensive search of peer-reviewed research literature encompassing in vitro, in vivo, model organism, and clinical studies. From these publications, we describe the olfactory system, and discuss the penetrance of ciliopathies and impact of cilia loss on olfactory function. In addition, we outlined the developing therapies for ciliopathies across different organ and cell culture systems, and discussed their potential therapeutic application to the mammalian olfactory system. One-hundred sixty-one manuscripts were included in the review, centering on the understanding of olfactory penetrance of ciliopathies, and discussing the potential therapeutic options for ciliopathies in the context of the mammalian olfactory system. Forty-four manuscripts were used to generate a table listing the known congenital causes of olfactory dysfunction, with the first ten listed are linked to ciliopathies. Twenty-three manuscripts were used to outline the potential of small molecules for the olfactory system. Emphasis was placed on HDAC6 inhibitors and lithium, both of which were shown to stabilize microtubule structures, contributing to ciliogenesis and cilia lengthening. Seventy-five manuscripts were used to describe gene therapy and gene therapeutic strategies. Included were the implementation of adenoviral, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and lentiviral vectors to treat ciliopathies across different organ systems and application toward the olfactory system. Thus far, adenoviral and AAVmeditated ciliary restoration demonstrated successful proof-of-principle preclinical studies.

Dysfunction of the TZ protein CC2D2A causes Joubert/Meckel syndromes in humans and loss of ciliary protein localization in animal models, including opsins in retinal photoreceptors. The link between the TZ and upstream vesicle trafficking has been little explored to date. Moreover, the role of the small GTPase Rab8 in opsin-carrier vesicle (OCV) trafficking has been recently questioned in a mouse model. Using correlative light and electron microscopy and live imaging in zebrafish photoreceptors, we provide the first live characterization of Rab8-mediated trafficking in photoreceptors in vivo. Our results support a possibly redundant role for both Rab8a/b paralogs in OCV trafficking, based on co-localization of Rab8 and opsins in vesicular structures, and joint movement of Rab8-tagged particles with opsin. We further investigate the role of the TZ protein Cc2d2a in Rab8-mediated trafficking using cc2d2a zebrafish mutants and identify a requirement for Cc2d2a in the latest step of OCV trafficking, namely vesicle fusion. Progressive accumulation of opsin-containing vesicles in the apical portion of photoreceptors lacking Cc2d2a is caused by disorganization of the vesicle fusion machinery at the periciliary membrane with mislocalization and loss of the t-SNAREs SNAP25 and Syntaxin3 and of the exocyst component Exoc4. We further observe secondary defects on upstream Rab8-trafficking with cytoplasmic accumulation of Rab8. Taken together, our results support participation of Rab8 in OCV trafficking and identify a novel role for the TZ protein Cc2d2a in fusion of incoming ciliary-directed vesicles, through organization of the vesicle fusion machinery at the periciliary membrane.",

All of the gene products localize in and around the primary cilium, making JS a canonical ciliopathy. Ciliopathies are unified by their overlapping clinical features and underlying mechanisms involving ciliary dysfunction.

The associated phenotypes range from isolated neurological involvement to JS with retinal dystrophy, additional brain abnormalities (e.g., heterotopia, Dandy-Walker malformation), pituitary insufficiency, and/or synpolydactyly. We show that ARMC9 localizes to the basal body of the cilium and is upregulated during ciliogenesis. Typical ciliopathy phenotypes (curved body shape, retinal dystrophy, coloboma, and decreased cilia) in a CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish mutant model provide additional support for ARMC9 as a ciliopathy-associated gene.

The chromo domain of HP1 is necessary for both targeting and transcriptional repression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the correct localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) depends on Clr4, a homologue of the mammalian SUV39H1 histone methylase. Both Clr4 and SUV39H1 methylate specifically lysine 9 of histone H3 (ref. 6). Here we show that HP1 can bind with high affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 but not at lysine 4. The chromo domain of HP1 is identified as its methyl-lysine-binding domain. A point mutation in the chromo domain, which destroys the gene silencing activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolishes methyl-lysine-binding activity. Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe shows that the methylase activity of Clr4 is necessary for the correct localization of Swi6 at centromeric heterochromatin and for gene silencing. These results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a 'methyl marker' on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromo domain. This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the heterochromatic state.",

In addition to histone modifications that facilitate gene activity, it is of similar importance to restrict inappropriate gene expression if cellular and developmental programmes are to proceed unperturbed. Here we show that mammalian methyltransferases that selectively methylate histone H3 on lysine 9 (Suv39h HMTases) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins--a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a functional chromo domain; thus, the HP1 chromo domain is a specific interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine9 of histone H3. In vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after the re-introduction of a catalytically active SWUV39H1 HMTase. Our data define a molecular mechanism through which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.",

It localises to both constitutive and facultative heterochromatin and replicates late in S-phase of the cell cycle. Significantly, Me9H3 is enriched in the inactive mammalian X chromosome (Xi) in female cells, as well as in the XY body during meiosis in the male, and forms a G-band pattern along the arms of the autosomes. Me9H3 is a constituent of imprinted chromosomes that are repressed. The paternal and maternal pronuclei in one-cell mouse embryos show a striking non-equivalence in Me9H3: the paternal pronucleus contains no immunocytologically detectable Me9H3. The levels of Me9H3 on the parental chromosomes only become equivalent after the two-cell stage. Finally, we provide evidence that Me9H3 is neither necessary nor sufficient for localisation of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to chromosomal DNA.",

Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing. The histone tail inserts as a beta strand, completing the beta-sandwich architecture of the chromodomain. The methylammonium group is caged by three aromatic side chains, whereas adjacent residues form discerning contacts with one face of the chromodomain.

Methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 is recognized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which directs the binding of other proteins to control chromatin structure and gene expression. Here we show that HP1 uses an induced-fit mechanism for recognition of this modification, as revealed by the structure of its chromodomain bound to a histone H3 peptide dimethylated at Nzeta of lysine 9. The binding pocket for the N-methyl groups is provided by three aromatic side chains, Tyr21, Trp42 and Phe45, which reside in two regions that become ordered on binding of the peptide. The side chain of Lys9 is almost fully extended and surrounded by residues that are conserved in many other chromodomains. The QTAR peptide sequence preceding Lys9 makes most of the additional interactions with the chromodomain, with HP1 residues Val23, Leu40, Trp42, Leu58 and Cys60 appearing to be a major determinant of specificity by binding the key buried Ala7. These findings predict which other chromodomains will bind methylated proteins and suggest a motif that they recognize.",

In Drosophila S2 cells, and on polytene chromosomes, methyl-Lys 27 and Pc are both excluded from areas that are enriched in methyl-Lys 9 and HP1. Swapping of the chromodomain regions of Pc and HP1 is sufficient for switching the nuclear localization patterns of these factors, indicating a role for their chromodomains in both target site binding and discrimination. To better understand the molecular basis for the selection of methyl-lysine binding sites, we solved the 1.8 A structure of the Pc chromodomain in complex with a H3 peptide bearing trimethyl-Lys 27, and compared it with our previously determined structure of the HP1 chromodomain in complex with a H3 peptide bearing trimethyl-Lys 9.

Here we show that HP1alpha, -beta, and -gamma are released from chromatin during the M phase of the cell cycle, even though tri-methylation levels of histone H3 lysine 9 remain unchanged. However, the additional, transient modification of histone H3 by phosphorylation of serine 10 next to the more stable methyl-lysine 9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B, which phosphorylates serine 10 on histone H3, causes retention of HP1 proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 serine 10 phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin in M phase. These findings establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions, through a combinatorial readout of two adjacent post-translational modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.",

Suppressor of Zeste 12 (SUZ12) is a requisite member of the EED/EZH2 histone methyltransferase complexes, and is required for full activity of these complexes in vitro. In mammals and flies, SUZ12/Su(z)12 is necessary for trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on facultative heterochromatin. However, Su(z)12 is unique among Polycomb Group Proteins in that Su(z)12 mutant flies exhibit gross defects in position effect variegation, suggesting a role for Su(z)12 in constitutive heterochromatin formation. We investigated the role of Suz12 in constitutive heterochromatin and discovered that Suz12 is required for histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) in differentiated but not undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells. Knockdown of SUZ12 in human cells caused a reduction in H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, and altered the distribution of HP1 alpha. In contrast, EZH2 knockdown caused loss of H3K27me3 but not H3K9me3, indicating that SUZ12 regulates H3-K9 methylation in an EZH2-independent fashion.

However, the importance of HP1 interaction for Suv39h-mediated H3K9me3 formation at the pericentromere is not well characterized. To address this question, we introduced HP1 binding-defective, N-terminally truncated mouse Suv39h1 (\u0394N) into Suv39h-deficient cells. Pericentric H3K9me3-positive cells were not detected by endogenous-level expression of \u0394N. Notably, \u0394N could induce pericentric accumulation of H3K9me3 as wild type Suv39h1 did if it was overexpressed. These findings demonstrate that the N-terminal region of Suv39h1, presumably via HP1-Suv39h1 interaction, is required for Suv39h1-mediated pericentric H3K9me3 formation, but can be overridden if Suv39h1 is overproduced, indicating that Suv39h1-mediated heterochromatin formation is controlled by multiple modules, including HP1.",

Here, we provide clues toward the mechanism underlying ASXL1-mediated repression. Transfection assays in HEK293 or H1299 cells indicated that ASXL1 alone possessing autonomous transcriptional repression activity significantly represses RAR- or retinoid X receptor-dependent transcriptional activation, and the N-terminal portion of ASXL1 is responsible for the repression. Amino acid sequence analysis identified a consensus HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1)-binding site (HP1 box, PXVXL) in that region. Systematic in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that the HP1 box in ASXL1 is critical for the interaction with the chromoshadow domain of HP1. Transcription assays with HP1 box deletion or HP1alpha knockdown indicated that HP1alpha is required for ASXL1-mediated repression. Furthermore, we found a direct interaction of ASXL1 with histone H3 demethylase LSD1 through the N-terminal region nearby the HP1-binding site. ASXL1 binding to LSD1 was greatly increased by HP1alpha, resulting in the formation of a ternary complex. LSD1 cooperates with ASXL1 in transcriptional repression, presumably by removing H3K4 methylation, an active histone mark, but not H3K9 methylation, a repressive histone mark recognized by HP1. This possibility was supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays followed by ASXL1 overexpression or knockdown. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that ASXL1 cooperates with HP1 to modulate LSD1 activity, leading to a change in histone H3 methylation and thereby RAR repression.",

TFL2/LHP1 represses transcription of numerous genes, including the flowering-time genes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), as well as the floral organ identity genes AGAMOUS (AG) and APETALA 3 (AP3). These genes are also regulated by proteins of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and it has been proposed that TFL2/LHP1 represents a potential stabilizing factor of PRC2 activity. Here we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to an Arabidopsis Chromosome 4 tiling array (ChIP-chip) that TFL2/LHP1 associates with hundreds of small domains, almost all of which correspond to genes located within euchromatin. We investigated the chromatin marks to which TFL2/LHP1 binds and show that, in vitro, TFL2/LHP1 binds to histone H3 di- or tri-methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2 or H3K9me3), the marks recognized by HP1, and to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), the mark deposited by PRC2. However, in vivo TFL2/LHP1 association with chromatin occurs almost exclusively and co-extensively with domains marked by H3K27me3, but not H3K9me2 or -3. Moreover, the distribution of H3K27me3 is unaffected in lhp1 mutant plants, indicating that unlike PRC2 components, TFL2/LHP1 is not involved in the deposition of this mark.

Cbx3 is one of the paralogues of HP1 proteins, which has been reported to specifically recognize trimethylated histone H3K9 mark, and a consensus binding motif has been defined for the Cbx3 chromodomain.

We also determined the crystal structures of the human Cbx3 chromodomain in complex with dimethylated histone H1K26 and trimethylated G9aK185 peptides, respectively. The complex structures unveil that the Cbx3 chromodomain specifically bind methylated histone H1K26 and G9aK185 through a conserved mechanism. The Cbx3 chromodomain binds with comparable affinities to all of the methylated H3K9, H1K26 and G9aK185 peptides.

The recruitment of specific binding proteins that recognize and interact with particular histone modifications is thought to constitute a fundamental mechanism by which histone marks mediate biological function. For instance, tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is important for recruiting heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging, and heterochromatin formation. Until now, little was known about the regulation of effector-histone mark interactions, and in particular, of the binding of HP1 to H3K9me3. Recently, we and others presented evidence that a \"binary methylation-phosphorylation switch\" mechanism controls the dynamic release of HP1 from H3K9me3 during the cell cycle: phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10ph) occurs at the onset of mitosis, interferes with HP1-H3K9me3 interaction, and therefore, ejects HP1 from its binding site. Here, we discuss the biological function of HP1 release from chromatin during mitosis, consider implications why the cell controls HP1 binding by such a methylation-phosphorylation switching mechanism, and reflect on other cellular pathways where binary switching of HP1 might occur.",

Here we discuss functions of the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) family of proteins that recognize H3K9me, an epigenetic mark generated by the histone methyltransferases SU(VAR)3-9 and orthologues. Loss of HP1 proteins causes chromosome segregation defects and lethality in some organisms; a reduction in levels of HP1 family members is associated with cancer progression in humans.

Although genetic and cell biological aspects have been elucidated, the molecular details of HP1 binding to H3K9me3 nucleosomes are unknown. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and biophysical measurements on fully defined recombinant experimental systems, we demonstrate that H3K9me3 works as an on/off switch regulating distinct binding modes of hHP1\u03b2 to the nucleosome. The methyl-mark determines a highly flexible and very dynamic interaction of the chromodomain of hHP1\u03b2 with the H3-tail. There are no other constraints of interaction or additional multimerization interfaces. In contrast, in the absence of methylation, the hinge region and the N-terminal tail form weak nucleosome contacts mainly with DNA. In agreement with the high flexibility within the hHP1\u03b2-H3K9me3 nucleosome complex, the chromoshadow domain does not provide a direct binding interface. Our results report the first detailed structural analysis of a dynamic protein-nucleosome complex directed by a histone modification and provide a conceptual framework for understanding similar interactions in the context of chromatin.",

A prototype example is the trimethylation (Me3) of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3), which is a readout by an aromatic cage of the chromodomain of heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1) thereby leading to transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation. Considering that the lysine methylation does not change the charge state of the histone tail and such aromatic-cage mediated recognition of the quaternary ammonium moiety is emerging as the most striking mechanistic commonality for the state-specific recognition of histone lysine methylation, it is of particular interest and importance to understand the physical origin regarding how the aromatic cage distinguishes between the H3K9Me3 mark and its unmethylated counterpart. Here we have simulated relative binding free energies among HP1 chromodomain-H3 tail complexes differing at position 9 of the H3 tail. Our simulated results further confirm the essential role of cation-pi interactions for the binding of a methylated H3 tail by an HP1 chromodomain but indicate that the effect from an electrostatic origin is not dominant in distinguishing between the H3K9Me3 mark and its unmethylated counterpart. Meanwhile, our calculated free energy difference between H3-tert-butyl norleucine 9 and H3-methylnorleucine 9 in their binding to the HP1 clearly reveals the importance of the charge independent interactions for the state-specific readout of histone lysine trimethylation marks.",

To probe the dependence of HP1a binding on H3K9me, its dependence on these three HKMTs, and the division of labor between the HKMTs, we have examined correlations between HP1a binding and H3K9me patterns in wild type and null mutants of these HKMTs. We show here that Su(var)3-9 controls H3K9me-dependent binding of HP1a in pericentromeric regions, while Setdb1 controls it in cytological region 2L:31 and (together with POF) in chromosome 4. HP1a binds to the promoters and within bodies of active genes in these three regions. More importantly, however, HP1a binding at promoters of active genes is independent of H3K9me and POF. Rather, it is associated with heterochromatin protein 2 (HP2) and open chromatin. Our results support a hypothesis in which HP1a nucleates with high affinity independently of H3K9me in promoters of active genes and then spreads via H3K9 methylation and transient looping contacts with those H3K9me target sites.",

In an open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan as compared with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. Patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed while they were receiving at least two previous therapies, including trastuzumab, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks) or physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review. Secondary end points included overall survival, response duration, progression-free survival, confirmed response (response persisting \u22654 weeks), and safety. Of 187 treated patients, 125 received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 62 chemotherapy (55 received irinotecan and 7 paclitaxel). An objective response was reported in 51% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group, as compared with 14% of those in the physician's choice group (P&lt;0.001). Overall survival was longer with trastuzumab deruxtecan than with chemotherapy (median, 12.5 vs. 8.4 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.88; P = 0.01, which crossed the prespecified O'Brien-Fleming boundary [0.0202 on the basis of number of deaths]). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 51% of the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 24% of the physician's choice group), anemia (38% and 23%, respectively), and decreased white-cell count (21% and 11%). A total of 12 patients had trastuzumab deruxtecan-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (grade 1 or 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 or 4 in 3), as adjudicated by an independent committee. One drug-related death (due to pneumonia) was noted in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group; no drug-related deaths occurred in the physician's choice group. Therapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan led to significant improvements in response and overall survival, as compared with standard therapies, among patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Myelosuppression and interstitial lung disease were the notable toxic effects.

[fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate composed of the anti-HER2 antibody and the topoisomerase I inhibitor, an exatecan derivative. It has shown efficacy against tumors that express HER2 and is currently under evaluation in clinical trials. We here show that the antitumor activity of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is dependent on the expression level of HER2 protein in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines negative for HER2 amplification. We established isogenic CRC cell lines that express various levels of HER2 protein in the absence of HER2 amplification, and we found that cells that express HER2 at a high level were sensitive to [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan but not to conventional HER2-targeted therapies. Furthermore, [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan manifested a bystander killing effect both in vitro and in vivo, with cells essentially negative for HER2 expression also being killed in the presence of HER2-expressing cells, an effect that has the potential to overcome heterogeneity of HER2 expression in CRC tumors. Our results thus suggest that [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan warrants further study as a potential treatment for CRC tumors that express HER2 protein in the absence of HER2 amplification.",

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (also known as DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a humanised antibody against HER2, a novel enzyme-cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. We assessed its safety and tolerability in patients with advanced breast and gastric or gastro-oesophageal tumours. This was an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial done at two study sites in Japan. Eligible patients were at least 20 years old with breast or gastric or gastro-oesophageal carcinomas refractory to standard therapy regardless of HER2 status. Participants received initial intravenous doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan from 0\u00b78 to 8\u00b70 mg/kg and dose-limiting toxicities were assessed over a 21-day cycle; thereafter, dose reductions were implemented as needed and patients were treated once every 3 weeks until they had unacceptable toxic effects or their disease progressed. Primary endpoints included identification of safety and the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dosing and were analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug.

Up to the study cutoff date of Feb 1, 2017, no dose-limiting toxic effects, substantial cardiovascular toxic effects, or deaths occurred. One patient was removed from the activity analysis because they had insufficient target lesions for analysis. The most common grade 3 adverse events were decreased lymphocyte (n=3) and decreased neutrophil count (n=2); and grade 4 anaemia was reported by one patient. Three serious adverse events-febrile neutropenia, intestinal perforation, and cholangitis-were reported by one patient each. Overall, in 23 evaluable patients, including six patients with low HER2-expressing tumours, ten patients achieved an objective response (43%, 95% CI 23\u00b72-65\u00b75). Disease control was achieved in 21 (91%; 95% CI 72\u00b70-98\u00b79) of 23 patients. Median follow-up time was 6\u00b77 months (IQR 4\u00b74-10\u00b72), with nine (90%) of ten responses seen at doses of 5\u00b74 mg/kg or greater. The maximum tolerated dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan was not reached. In this small, heavily pretreated study population, trastuzumab deruxtecan showed antitumour activity, even in low HER2-expressing tumours.

Here, we examined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of DS-8201a and DXd in cynomolgus monkeys, a cross-reactive species. Following intravenous (iv) administration of DS-8201a, the linker was stable in plasma, and systemic DXd exposure was low. DXd was rapidly cleared following iv dosing. Biodistribution studies revealed that intact DS-8201a was present mostly in the blood without tissue-specific retention. The major pathway of excretion for DXd was the faecal route following iv administration of radiolabelled DS-8201a. The only detectable metabolite in the urine and faeces was unmetabolized DXd. DXd is a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides, P-gp, and breast cancer resistance protein. In conclusion, the stable linker in circulation and the high clearance of DXd upon release resulted in the low systemic exposure to DXd. Furthermore, the minimal tissue-specific retention and rapid excretion of DXd into faeces as its unmetabolized form with potentially limited impact on drug - drug interaction as a victim were also critical elements of the PK profile of DS-8201a.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28031292": "HSJ1 (DNAJB2), a member of the DNAJ family of molecular chaperones, is a key player in neuronal proteostasis maintenance. It binds ubiquitylated proteins through its Ubiquitin Interacting Motifs (UIMs) and facilitates their delivery to the proteasome for degradation. Mutations in the DNAJB2 gene lead to inherited neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-2, distal hereditary motor neuropathies, spinal muscular atrophy with parkinsonism and the later stages can resemble amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. HSJ1 overexpression can reduce aggregation of neurodegeneration-associated proteins in vitro and in vivo; however, the regulation of HSJ1 function is little understood. Here we show that CK2, a ubiquitous and constitutively active protein kinase, phosphorylates HSJ1 within its second UIM, at the dominant site Ser250 and the hierarchical site Ser247. A phospho-HSJ1 specific antibody confirmed phosphorylation of endogenous HSJ1a and HSJ1b. A tandem approach of phospho-site mutation and treatment with CK2 specific inhibitors demonstrated that phosphorylation at these sites is accompanied by a reduced ability of HSJ1 to bind ubiquitylated clients and to exert its chaperone activity. Our results disclose a novel interplay between ubiquitin- and phosphorylation-dependent signalling, and represent the first report of a regulatory mechanism for UIM-dependent function. They also suggest that CK2 inhibitors could release the full neuroprotective potential of HSJ1, and deserve future interest as therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease.",

We report here a novel rare variant of dHMN with autosomal recessive inheritance in a large Jewish family originating from Morocco. The disease is characterized by a predominance of paralysis at the lower limbs and an early adulthood onset. We performed a genetic study in this family to identify and characterized the causing mutation. Homozygosity mapping strategy and sequencing of the candidate genes were performed. Expression studies were made on patient fibroblasts. Functional experiments were performed on a cellular model of motor neuron disease. We mapped the disease to the 2q34-q36.1 chromosomal region and identified a homozygous splice mutation in the gene HSJ1 (DNAJB2) decreasing the expression of the 2 main isoforms HSJ1a and HSJ1b. Overexpression of both HSJ1a and HSJ1b reduced inclusion formation induced by the mutated SOD1-A4V in a neuronal cellular model. HSJ1 is a neuronal enriched member of the HSP40/DNAJ co-chaperone family. Previous studies have shown that HSP40 proteins play a crucial role in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in several neuronal types, in animal models and human diseases. Interestingly, this mutation causing a loss-of-function of HSJ1 is linked to a pure lower motor neuron disease, strongly suggesting that HSJ1 also plays an important and specific role in motor neurons.",

We studied the effects of HSJ1a on the protein levels of both normal and the disease--related polyQ-expanded forms of ataxin-3 (Atx3) in cells. The results demonstrate that the N-terminal J-domain and the C-terminal UIM domain of HSJ1a exert opposite functions in regulating the protein level of cellular overexpressed Atx3. This dual regulation is dependent on the binding of the J-domain with HSP70, and the UIM domain with polyUb chains. The J-domain down-regulates the protein level of Atx3 through HSP70 mediated proteasomal degradation, while the UIM domain may alleviate this process via maintaining the ubiquitinated Atx3.

There are few reports regarding the in vitro metabolism of zolmitriptan. Previous studies indicated zolmitriptan was metabolized via CYP1A2 in human hepatic microsomes. In order to study the enzyme kinetics and drug interaction, the metabolism of zolmitriptan and possible drug-drug interactions were investigated in rat hepatic microsomes induced with different inducers. An active metabolite, N-demethylzolmitriptan, was detected and another minor, inactive metabolite that was reported in human hepatic microsomes was not detected in this study. The enzyme kinetics for the formation of N-demethylzolmitriptan from zolmitriptan in rat liver microsomes pretreated with BNF were 96+/-22 microM (K(m)), 11+/-3 pmol min(-1)mg protein(-1) (V(max)), and 0.12+/-0.02 microl min(-1)mg protein(-1) (CL(int)). Fluvoxamine and diphenytriazol inhibited zolmitriptan N-demethylase activity catalyzed by CYP1A2 (K(i)=3.8+/-0.3 and 3.2+/-0.1 microM, respectively). Diazepam and propranolol elicited a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan (K(i)=70+/-11 and 90+/-18 microM, respectively). Cimetidine and moclobemide produced no significant effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan. Fluvoxamine yielded a k(inactivation) value of 0.16 min(-1), and K(i) of 57 microM. The results suggest that rat hepatic microsomes are a reasonable model to study the metabolism of zolmitriptan, although there is a difference in the amount of minor, inactive metabolites between human hepatic microsomes and rat liver microsomes. The results of the inhibition experiments provided information for the interactions between zolmitriptan and drugs co-administrated in clinic, and it is helpful to explain the drug-drug interactions of clinical relevance on enzyme level. This study aso demonstrated that fluvoxamine may be a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP1A2.",

Zolmitriptan has vasoconstrictor activity in cerebral vessels and may cause slight elevations of blood pressure in subjects without hypertension. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolmitriptan (5, 10, and 20 mg) were evaluated in 16 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (controlled by hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg once daily) and 17 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, four-period crossover study. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolites were dose proportional. Although area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were slightly higher in patients with hypertension at all doses, this was only statistically significant for AUC at the 20-mg dose. Differences between subjects with and without hypertension were not clinically significant. Zolmitriptan produced a small increase in blood pressure, but this was similar in subjects with and without hypertension and was of no clinical significance. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated in both groups. Zolmitriptan plasma concentrations were higher in women than in men, with higher values of AUC and Cmax and lower total clearance in women. These results indicate that zolmitriptan can be administered for treatment of migraine in patients with controlled hypertension without dose adjustment.",

We collected a total of 18 patients with cluster headache and experience with intranasal zolmitriptan; 17 had used subcutaneous sumatriptan and 8 oral triptans. The main reasons for trying intranasal zolmitriptan were: poor tolerability in 12 patients and insufficient efficacy in 6. Among the 17 patients experienced in subcutaneous sumatriptan, 12 (71 %) preferred nasal zolmitriptan, 2 (18 %) subcutaneous sumatriptan and 2 (12 %) did not express any preference. The reasons for preferring intranasal zolmitriptan were: higher convenience (n = 6), better tolerability (n = 5), lower price (n = 2) and higher efficacy (n = 1). Seven out of the 8 patients who had taken oral triptans preferred nasal zolmitriptan, in all cases due to higher subjective efficacy. A total of 11 patients showed efficacy within 30 minutes. Only 3 patients referred to adverse events, always mild. The 5 mg nasal formulation of zolmitriptan is a potential new option for the symptomatic treatment of cluster headache. This formulation should be considered in patients with poor tolerability to subcutaneous sumatriptan and in those attacks where quick access to inhaled oxygen is not possible. These results suggest that a controlled trial with nasal zolmitriptan in this indication would be worthwhile.",

Zolmitriptan is cleared by metabolism followed by urinary excretion of the metabolites. There are three major metabolites, one of which, the N-desmethyl metabolite, is active as a 5HT1D agonist and has mean plasma concentrations approximately two thirds those of the parent compound. The other two metabolites, the N-oxide and indoleacetic acid, are inactive. The elimination half lives of zolmitriptan and its metabolites are similar, approximately 3 h. Zolmitriptan and its active metabolite are minimally protein bound in the plasma (approximately 25%).

It penetrates into the central nervous system and, like other 5-HT1B/D agonists, its pharmacotherapeutic profile may include significant anti-aggressive effects. To examine whether zolmitriptan has potential anti-aggressive effects by studying two kinds of aggressive behavior in mice--species-typical and aggression under the influence of alcohol. A second objective was to study whether pre- or post-synaptic receptors mediate these anti-aggressive effects. Initially, the anti-aggressive effects of zolmitriptan were studied in male CFW mice during 5-min resident-intruder confrontations. To confirm the 5-HT1B receptor as a critical site of action for the anti-aggressive effects, the zolmitriptan dose-effect determinations were repeated after pretreatment with GR 127935 (10 mg/kg, i.p.). In further experiments, mice were treated concurrently with alcohol (1.0 g/kg, p.o.) and zolmitriptan (1-30 mg/kg, i.p.) in order to compare the effects of this agonist on species-typical and alcohol-heightened aggression. Finally, mice were infused with the neurotoxin 5,7-DHT (10 microg) into the raph\u00e9 area to eliminate somatodendritic and presynaptic autoreceptors. The anti-aggressive effects of zolmitriptan (17 mg/kg, i.p.) or CP-94,253 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were assessed 10 days after the lesion, and levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were measured in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Zolmitriptan exerted behaviorally specific anti-aggressive effects. The reduction in aggression was antagonized by GR 127935, indicated by a rightward shift in the dose-effect curves of zolmitriptan, showing the specificity for the 5-HT1B receptors. Zolmitriptan also decreased alcohol-heightened aggression with equal efficacy. The anti-aggressive effects of CP-94,253 and zolmitriptan remained unaltered by 5,7-DHT lesions that depleted cortical and hippocampal 5-HT by 60-80%. Zolmitriptan proved to be an effective and behaviorally specific anti-aggressive agent in situations that engender moderate and alcohol-heightened levels of aggression. These effects are potentially due to activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1BD receptors.",

Several studies have demonstrated the tolerability and efficacy of 311C90 in the treatment of a single migraine headache. The objectives of this open-label study were to assess the tolerability and efficacy of repeated doses of 5 mg of 311C90 for acute treatment of multiple attacks for up to 1 year. Patients were allowed to treat as many migraine headaches (mild, moderate, or severe) as desired with an initial dose. A second 5-mg dose could be used to treat recurrence should it develop. Safety assessments included ECG, the frequency, intensity, and duration of adverse experiences, and routine hematology, urinalysis, and clinical chemistry parameters. Efficacy assessments included headache severity at 2 hours (i.e., severe, moderate, mild, or none), the proportion of patients pain-free at 2 hours, the use of a second tablet to treat headache recurrence if it developed, and the consistency of these findings over time. The efficacy profile and the nature/incidence of adverse events reported appear to be consistent with previous 311C90 studies. The dosing regimen was well tolerated during multiple exposures. Notably, headache response rates were consistently good after both initial and repeated exposure (&gt; 80% across 1 to 30 attacks).

In addition, at least three others are in advanced stage of clinical development (almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan). This paper sets out to review the recent data with the aim of identifying: 1) What are the critical differences between the TELs and sumatriptan? 2) How do the currently licensed TELs compare? 3) Is it possible to provide a rational approach to migraine therapy based on objective differences in the clinical profile of these new drugs? Recent randomised controlled and comparator data were reviewed, including the independent FDA assessment of rizatriptan. Critical differences for the new TELs (naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan) which may lead to more rational migraine management: Both rizatriptan (10 mg) and zolmitriptan (2.5 mg and 5.0 mg) have demonstrated superior efficacy to sumatriptan 100 mg, and 25 and 50 mg respectively. Therefore, for first line use either rizatriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate for moderate and severe headache. Rizatriptan has a more rapid onset of action than sumatriptan 100 mg. Both rizatriptan and zolmitriptan have a more rapid onset of action than naratriptan. Therefore, for a rapid onset of action either rizatriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate. Naratriptan would appear to have a lower recurrent headache rate than sumatriptan, rizatriptan or zolmitriptan. However, 24-hour efficacy rates for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg were significantly greater than for sumatriptan 25 mg and 50 mg and were not significantly different from naratriptan. Therefore, for headaches of long duration and with a tendency to recur (e.g. menstrual headaches) either naratriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate. Naratriptan has lower reported adverse event rates comparable with placebo. This would support the use of naratriptan 2.5 mg in patients who have demonstrated poor tolerance to the \"triptan type\" adverse events.",

The serotonin (5HT1B/D) agonist zolmitriptan (311C90) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute attacks of migraine and experimental data suggest that it may have both peripheral and central sites of action. This study sought to further investigate possible central effects of zolmitriptan (311C90) by examining its distribution in the central nervous system. Specific binding of [3H]-zolmitriptan was determined both ex vivo and in vitro in the cat brain. For the ex vivo studies, cats were anaesthetized with halothane and alpha-chloralose (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal). A femoral vein catheter was inserted for injection of the [3H]-zolmitriptan and then 1 h after injection the brain removed. For the in vitro studies fresh frozen brain slices were incubated with labelled and masking concentrations of zolmitriptan. The distribution of [3H]-zolmitriptan was determined using quantitative autoradiographic methods. The in vitro work demonstrated specific binding of [3H]-zolmitriptan in the superficial laminae of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and dorsal horns of the C1 and C2 cervical spinal cord. The density of binding was 53 +/- 9 fmol/mg for the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, 47 +/- 7 fmol/mg for C1 and 50 +/- 6 fmol/mg for C2. The ex vivo work demonstrated binding in anatomically identical areas which was less dense than that seen with the in vitro method. These data confirm the existence of a population of receptors that specifically bind zolmitriptan following systemic administration. These receptors may, in part, be responsible for its clinical efficacy and reinforce the importance of central trigeminal neurons as a possible site of action of anti-migraine drugs.",

Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in large numbers of adults with moderate to severe migraine attacks. Oral zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5mg has a rapid onset of action (significant headache relief is observed at 45 minutes) and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond at 2 hours. The drug is significantly more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour headache response rates and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia are also alleviated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine associated with menses and migraine with aura. There is some evidence to support the use of zolmitriptan in patients with migraine who have had a poor response to previous therapy. The efficacy of zolmitriptan appears to be maintained, with no tachyphylaxis, following repeated administration for multiple attacks of migraine over a prolonged period of time, with high headache response rates reported over all attacks. In comparison with placebo, the incidence of persistent migraine headache is reduced by zolmitriptan and recurrent migraine headache occurs less frequently with the active treatment. Zolmitriptan has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of persistent and/or recurrent migraine headache. For relief of migraine headache, zolmitriptan 5mg had similar efficacy to sumatriptan 100mg for a single attack, but generally was more effective than sumatriptan 25 and 50mg for multiple attacks, in single trials. The incidence of recurrent headache with zolmitriptan was similar to that with sumatriptan. Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated with most adverse events being mild to moderate, transient and resolving without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common adverse events with zolmitriptan therapy are asthenia, heaviness other than that of the chest or neck, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, paraesthesia, warm sensation, tightness, vasodilation and chest pain. Zolmitriptan is effective across a wide range of migraine subtypes, maintains efficacy when used in the long term and is generally well tolerated. Further clinical experience is necessary to define the position of zolmitriptan among other currently or soon to be available selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. However, on the basis of available data, zolmitriptan should emerge as a useful treatment option in the management of patients with moderate to severe migraine.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18028032": "Migraine is a common, often disabling, neurovascular disease that has been shown to be associated with abnormal serotonergic activity. Drugs that modulate serotonin receptors are commonly used in the acute treatment of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan, a 5-hydroxytryptophan(1B/1D) receptor agonist, is once such drug that is used in acute migraine therapy. Zolmitriptan is FDA approved for the treatment of acute migraine attacks and there is recent literature demonstrating its efficacy in the acute treatment of cluster attacks. It is rapidly absorbed and is detectable in the plasma within 2 - 5 min for the nasal spray formulation and within 15 min for the oral formulations. Zolmitriptan reaches peak plasma levels in 2 - 4 h and significant plasma levels are maintained for up to 6 h and lower levels for over 15 h. As zolmitriptan's metabolism is predominantly hepatic, patients with severe hepatic impairment should not receive zolmitriptan. However, only 25% of zolmitriptan is bound to plasma proteins and thus it is unlikely for drug interactions involving the displacement of highly protein-bound drugs. Zolmitriptan is generally very well tolerated and less than half of patients in clinical trials have reported adverse events, most of which are mild and transient, although rare serious cardiovascular events have been reported with all triptans. When patients are appropriately selected, zolmitriptan is both a safe and effective acute care migraine treatment. In this review the biological role of serotonin and its receptors is covered, followed by an in-depth review of the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of zolmitriptan. Finally, the clinical application of zolmitriptan's use in patients is dicussed.",

The drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent with its selectivity for 5HT1B/1D receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. Zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects, zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response. Zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3H]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. Studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.",

Oral zolmitriptan (2.5 and 5 mg) has an onset of action within 45 min and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond at 2 h. The orally-disintegrating zolmitriptan tablet has the advantage that it may be taken immediately, without the need for additional fluids, any time a migraine headache occurs. Patients may benefit in terms of improved efficacy from the convenience of the disintegrating tablet, since there is evidence that taking triptan therapy as early as possible in an attack is advantageous.

Oral zolmitriptan is also effective in the acute treatment of cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild-to-moderate, transient and resolving without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal.

Here we summarize current knowledge on several variations on this theme including: (1) hybrid operons, which have additional promoters between genes; (2) operons with exceptionally long (&gt; 1 kb) intercistronic regions; (3) operons with a second 3' end formation site close to the trans-splice site; (4) alternative operons, in which the exons are sometimes spliced as a single gene and sometimes as two genes; (5) SL1-type operons, which use SL1 instead of SL2 to trans-splice and in which there is no intercistronic space; (6) operons that make dicistronic mRNAs; and (7) non-operon gene clusters, in which either two genes use a single exon as the 3' end of one and the 5' end of the next, or the 3' UTR of one gene serves as the outron of the next. Each of these variations is relatively infrequent, but together they show a remarkable variety of tight-linkage gene arrangements in the C. elegans genome.",

We analyzed the frequency of duplication of operonic genes in C. elegans and confirmed that they are duplicated less often in the genome than monocistronic genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C. elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of gene duplication.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177958": "Trans-splicing of one of two short leader RNAs, SL1 or SL2, occurs at the 5' ends of pre-mRNAs of many C. elegans genes. We have exploited RNA-sequencing data from the modENCODE project to analyze the transcriptome of C. elegans for patterns of trans-splicing. Transcripts of \u223c70% of genes are trans-spliced, similar to earlier estimates based on analysis of far fewer genes. The mRNAs of most trans-spliced genes are spliced to either SL1 or SL2, but most genes are not trans-spliced to both, indicating that SL1 and SL2 trans-splicing use different underlying mechanisms. SL2 trans-splicing occurs in order to separate the products of genes in operons genome wide. Shorter intercistronic distance is associated with greater use of SL2. Finally, increased use of SL1 trans-splicing to downstream operon genes can indicate the presence of an extra promoter in the intercistronic region, creating what has been termed a \"hybrid\" operon. Within hybrid operons the presence of the two promoters results in the use of the two SL classes: Transcription that originates at the promoter upstream of another gene creates a polycistronic pre-mRNA that receives SL2, whereas transcription that originates at the internal promoter creates transcripts that receive SL1. Overall, our data demonstrate that &gt;17% of all C. elegans genes are in operons.",

In Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the XTBD-protein PAXT-1 stabilizes XRN2 to retain its activity. XRN2 activity is also promoted by 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase 1 (BPNT1) through hydrolysis of an endogenous XRN inhibitor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (PAP). Here, we find through unbiased screening that loss of bpnt-1 function suppresses lethality caused by paxt-1 deletion. This unexpected finding is explained by XRN2 autoregulation, which occurs through repression of a cryptic promoter activity and destabilization of the xrn-2 transcript. De-repression appears to be triggered such that more robust XRN2 perturbation, by elimination of both PAXT-1 and BPNT1, is less detrimental to worm viability than absence of PAXT-1 alone. Indeed, we find that two distinct XRN2 repression mechanisms are alleviated at different thresholds of XRN2 inactivation. Like more than 15% of C. elegans genes, xrn-2 occurs in an operon, and we identify additional operons under its control, consistent with a broader function of XRN2 in polycistronic gene regulation. Regulation occurs through intercistronic regions that link genes in an operon, but a part of the mechanisms may allow XRN2 to operate on monocistronic genes in organisms lacking operons.",

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the genome contains &gt;1000 operons that compose approximately 15% of the protein-coding genes. However, determination of the force(s) promoting the origin and maintenance of operons in C. elegans has proved elusive. Compared to bacterial operons, genes within a C. elegans operon often show poor coexpression and only sometimes encode proteins with related functions. Using analysis of microarray and large-scale in situ hybridization data, we demonstrate that almost all operon-encoded genes are expressed in germline tissue. However, genes expressed during spermatogenesis are excluded from operons. Operons group together along chromosomes in local clusters that also contain monocistronic germline-expressed genes. Additionally, germline expression of genes in operons is largely independent of the molecular function of the encoded proteins. These analyses demonstrate that mechanisms governing germline gene expression influence operon origination and/or maintenance. Thus, gene expression in a specific tissue can have profound effects on the evolution of genome organization.",

In this randomised, blinded, parallel-group, pragmatic equivalence trial, men in seven UK hospitals with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction were randomly assigned (1:1) at the point of surgery to receive ThuVARP or TURP. Patients were masked until follow-up completion. Centres used their usual TURP procedure (monopolar or bipolar). All trial surgeons underwent training on the ThuVARP technique. Co-primary outcomes were maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 12-months post-surgery. Equivalence was defined as a difference of 2\u00b75 points or less for IPSS and 4 mL per s or less for Qmax. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle.

The trial was conducted across seven UK centres (four university teaching hospitals and three district general hospitals). A total of 410 men aged \u226518 years presenting with either bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or urinary retention secondary to BPO, and suitable for surgery, were randomised (whilst under anaesthetic) 1:1 to receive the TURP or ThuVARP procedure. Resource use in relation to the operation, initial inpatient stay, and subsequent use of NHS services was collected for 12 months from randomisation (equivalent to primary effectiveness outcome) using hospital records and patient questionnaires. Resources were valued using UK reference costs. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the EuroQoL five Dimensions five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire completed at baseline, 3- and 12-months. Total adjusted mean costs, QALYs and incremental Net Monetary Benefit statistics were calculated: cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty.

Surgical outcomes, such as complications and blood transfusion rates, and hospital stay were similar for both procedures. Patient-reported urinary and sexual symptoms were also similar between the arms. Qualitative interviews indicated similar patient experiences with both procedures. However, 25% of participants in the ThuVARP arm did not undergo their randomised allocation, compared with 2% of participants in the TURP arm. Prostate cancer was also detected less frequently from routine histology after ThuVARP (65% lower odds of detection) in an exploratory analysis.

Preoperative Qmax and IPSS data could not be collected for participants with indwelling catheters, making adjustment for baseline status difficult. TURP was superior to ThuVARP in terms of Qmax, although both operations resulted in a Qmax considered clinically successful. ThuVARP also potentially resulted in lower detection rates of prostate cancer as a result of the smaller volume of tissue available for histology.

Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP) vaporises and resects the prostate using a surgical technique similar to TURP. The small amount of study data currently available suggests that ThuVARP may have certain advantages over TURP, including reduced blood loss and shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activities, and shorter duration of catheterisation. A multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial of ThuVARP versus standard TURP in men with BPO. Four hundred and ten men suitable for prostate surgery were randomised to receive either ThuVARP or TURP at four university teaching hospitals, and three district general hospitals. The key aim of the trial is to determine whether ThuVARP is equivalent to TURP judged on both the patient-reported International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the maximum urine flow rate (Qmax) at 12 months post-surgery. The general population has an increased life expectancy. As men get older their prostates enlarge, potentially causing BPO, which often requires surgery. Therefore, as the population ages, more prostate operations are needed to relieve obstruction. There is hence sustained interest in the condition and increasing need to find safer techniques than TURP. Various laser techniques have become available but none are widely used in the NHS because of lengthy training required for surgeons or inferior performance on clinical outcomes. Promising initial evidence from one RCT shows that ThuVARP has equivalent clinical effectiveness when compared to TURP, as well as other potential advantages. As ThuVARP uses a technique similar to that used in TURP, the learning curve is short, potentially making it also very quickly generalisable.

A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1 and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2. Acidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These results suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1/2, particularly under circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion.

Roundabouts comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis. Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional and growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies provide a mechanism to fine tune attractive and repulsive signals in a combinatorial manner required during neuronal development. While a mechanistic understanding of Slit mediated Robo signaling has advanced significantly further structural studies on larger assemblies are required for the design of new experiments to elucidate their role in cell surface receptor complexes. These will be necessary to understand the role of Slit -Robo signaling in neurogenesis, angiogenesis, organ development and cancer progression.

Estrogen is the main peripheral factor controlling GnRH secretion, and this action is mainly mediated by the transsynaptic pathway through nitric oxide, kisspeptin, leptin, among other factors. Kisspeptin is the most potent factor known to induce GnRH release. Nitric oxide and leptin also promote GnRH release; however, neurons expressing GnRH do not express the leptin receptor (OB-R). Leptin seems to modulate the expression of genes and proteins involved in the kisspeptin system. However, few kisspeptin-synthesizing cells in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and few cells, if any, in the preoptic area (POA) express OB-R; this indicates an indirect mechanism of leptin action on kisspeptin. Nitric oxide is an important intermediate in the actions of leptin in the central nervous system. Thus, this work aimed to verify the numbers of nNOS cells were activated by leptin in different hypothalamic areas; the modulatory effects of the nitrergic system on the kisspeptin system; and the indirect regulatory effect of leptin on the kisspeptin system via nitric oxide. Ovariectomized rats were treated with estrogen or a vehicle and received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of a nitric oxide donor, leptin or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) enzyme inhibitor. Thirty minutes after the injection, the animals were decapitated. Leptin acts directly on nitrergic neurons in different hypothalamic regions, and the effects on the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMV) and ventral dorsomedial hypothalamus (vDMH) are enhanced. The use of a nitric oxide donor or the administration of leptin stimulates the expression of the kisspeptin mRNA in the ARC of animals with or without estrogenic action; however, these changes are not observed in the POA. In addition, the action of leptin on the expression of the kisspeptin mRNA in the ARC is blocked by a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor. We concluded that the effects of leptin on the central nervous system are at least partially mediated by the nitrergic system. Also, nitric oxide acts on the kisspeptin system by modulating the expression of the kisspeptin mRNA, and leptin at least partially modulates the kisspeptin system through the nitrergic system, particularly in the ARC.",

A pharmacological dose of kisspeptin-10 significantly altered metabolism by suppressing food intake, meal size, eating rate, and TEE while increasing the RQ. These changes were linked to increased levels of insulin, leptin, resistin, and HDL. The current results suggest that a peripheral kisspeptin treatment could alter metabolism and energy homeostasis by suppressing appetite, food intake, and fat accumulation.",

Seabream specific partial cDNA sequences were identified for two key targets, kissr4 and kiss2, which were subsequently cloned and qPCR assays developed. Thereafter, to examine association in expression with sex change, a group of adult seabream (2+ years old) undergoing sex change were sampled for gene expression at two different periods of the annual cycle. To study the kisspeptin system ontogeny during early life stages, transcript levels were monitored in larvae (till 30 days-post-hatch, DPH) and post-larvae (from 30 till 140 DPH). During sex change, higher expression of kissr4 and kiss2 was observed in males when compared to females or individual undergoing sex change, this is suggestive of differential actions of the kisspeptin system during protandrous sex change. Equally, variable expression of the kisspeptin system during early ontogenic development was observed. The higher expression of kissr4 and kiss2 observed from 5 DPH, with elevations at 5-20 and 90 DPH for kissr4 and at 5, 10, 20, and 60 DPH for kiss2, is coincident with the early ontogeny of gnrh genes previously reported for seabream, and possibly related with early development of the reproductive axis in this species.",

Kisspeptin-13 is an endogenous isoform that consists of 13 amino acids. The action of kisspeptin in the regulation of gonadal function has been widely studied, but little is known as concerns its function in limbic brain structures. In the brain, the gene is transcribed within the hippocampal dentate gyrus. This paper reports on a study the effects of kisspeptin-13 on passive avoidance learning and the involvement of the adrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and GABA-A-ergic, opiate receptors and nitric oxide in its action in mice. Mice were pretreated with a nonselective \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, an \u03b12-adrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, a mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist, methysergide, a nonselective 5-HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist, cyproheptadine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, atropine, D2, D3, D4 dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid subunit A (GABAA) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, naloxone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist and nitro-l-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Kisspeptin-13 facilitated learning and memory consolidation in a passive avoidance paradigm. Phenoxybenzamine, yohimbine, propranolol, methysergide, cyproheptadine, atropine, bicuculline and nitro-l-arginine prevented the action of kisspeptin-13 on passive avoidance learning, but haloperidol and naloxone did not block the effects of kisspeptin-13. The results demonstrated that the action of kisspeptin-13 on the facilitation of passive avoidance learning and memory consolidation is mediated, at least in part, through interactions of the \u03b12-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, 5-HT2 serotonergic, muscarinic cholinergic and GABA-A-ergic receptor systems and nitric oxide.",

Mutations in humans or genetically targeted deletions in mice of either Kiss1 or Kiss1r cause profound hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Neurons that express Kiss1/kisspeptin are found in discrete nuclei in the hypothalamus, as well as other brain regions in many vertebrates, and their distribution, regulation, and function varies widely across species. Kisspeptin neurons directly innervate and stimulate GnRH neurons, which are the final common pathway through which the brain regulates reproduction. Kisspeptin neurons are sexually differentiated with respect to cell number and transcriptional activity in certain brain nuclei, and some kisspeptin neurons express other cotransmitters, including dynorphin and neurokinin B (whose physiological significance is unknown). Kisspeptin neurons express the estrogen receptor and the androgen receptor, and these cells are direct targets for the action of gonadal steroids in both male and female animals. Kisspeptin signaling in the brain has been implicated in mediating the negative feedback action of sex steroids on gonadotropin secretion, generating the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge, triggering and guiding the tempo of sexual maturation at puberty, controlling seasonal reproduction, and restraining reproductive activity during lactation. Kisspeptin signaling may also serve diverse functions outside of the classical realm of reproductive neuroendocrinology, including the regulation of metastasis in certain cancers, vascular dynamics, placental physiology, and perhaps even higher-order brain function.",

Kisspeptin, a recently identified critical reproductive hormone, can alter activity in certain brain structures but its effects on resting brain connectivity and networks in humans remain elusive. We determined the effects of kisspeptin on resting brain connectivity (using functional neuroimaging) and behavior (using psychometric analyses) in healthy men, in a randomized double-blinded 2-way placebo-controlled study. Kisspeptin's modulation of the default mode network (DMN) correlated with increased limbic activity in response to sexual stimuli (globus pallidus r = 0.500, P = 0.005; cingulate r = 0.475, P = 0.009). Furthermore, kisspeptin's DMN modulation was greater in men with less reward drive (r = -0.489, P = 0.008) and predicted reduced sexual aversion (r = -0.499, P = 0.006), providing key functional significance. Kisspeptin also enhanced key mood connections including between the amygdala-cingulate, hippocampus-cingulate, and hippocampus-globus pallidus (all P &lt; 0.05). Consistent with this, kisspeptin's enhancement of hippocampus-globus pallidus connectivity predicted increased responses to negative stimuli in limbic structures (including the thalamus and cingulate [all P &lt; 0.01]). Taken together, our data demonstrate a previously unknown role for kisspeptin in the modulation of functional brain connectivity and networks, integrating these with reproductive hormones and behaviors.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22649563": "Kisspeptin (product of the kiss1 gene) is the most potent known activator of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. Both kiss1 and the kisspeptin receptor are highly expressed in the hypothalamus of vertebrates, and low doses of kisspeptin have a robust and long-lasting stimulatory effect on the rate of action potential firing of hypophysiotropic gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 (GnRH1) neurons in mice. Fish have multiple populations of GnRH neurons distinguished by their location in the brain and the GnRH gene that they express. GnRH3 neurons located in the terminal nerve (TN) associated with the olfactory bulb are neuromodulatory and do not play a direct role in regulating pituitary-gonadal function. In medaka fish, the electrical activity of TN-GnRH3 neurons is modulated by visual cues from conspecifics, and is thought to act as a transmitter of information from the external environment to the central nervous system. TN-GnRH3 neurons also play a role in sexual motivation and arousal states, making them an important population of neurons to study for understanding coordination of complex behaviors. We investigated the role of kisspeptin in regulating electrical activity of TN-GnRH3 neurons in adult medaka. Using electrophysiology in an intact brain preparation, we show that a relatively brief treatment with 100 nM of kisspeptin had a long-lasting stimulatory effect on the electrical activity of an extrahypothalamic population of GnRH neurons. Dose-response analysis suggests a relatively narrow activational range of this neuropeptide. Further, blocking action potential firing with tetrodotoxin and blocking synaptic transmission with a low Ca(2+)/high Mg(2+) solution inhibited the stimulatory action of kisspeptin on electrical activity, indicating that kisspeptin is acting indirectly through synaptic regulation to excite TN-GnRH3 neurons. Our findings provide a new perspective on kisspeptin's broader functions within the central nervous system, through its regulation of an extrahypothalamic population of GnRH neurons involved in multiple neuromodulatory functions.",

By 1950, nearly 100 years later, scientists realized that the hypothalamus and its neurosecretory products play a key role in regulating gonadal function in both males and females. Another 20 years would be required to reveal the chemical identity of GnRH and establish that neurons producing GnRH represent the final common pathway through which the brain regulates gonadotropin secretion. It had also become clear that GnRH neurons behave more like motor neurons-better perhaps at going than stopping-and are themselves regulated by a complex network of afferent inputs, which guide the tempo of sexual maturation, regulate estrous and menstrual cycles, control seasonal breeding, and stop reproduction under adversity. In 2003, the revelation that kisspeptin and its receptor are critical for reproduction opened a floodgate of research documenting the role of kisspeptin neurons as central processors of reproduction. Today, there is wide consensus that kisspeptin signaling in the brain is essential, providing the impetus to GnRH neurons to awaken at puberty and reigning the activity of these neurons when discretion is advised. We celebrate this watershed moment-with full knowledge that time and discovery will provide context and perspective to even these heady days.",

The present study aimed to identify kisspeptin neurons in the bovine hypothalamus, clarifying that a central mechanism is also present in the cattle brain, as kisspeptin is known to play an important role in the stimulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)/gonadotropin secretion in other mammals. To characterize kisspeptin neurons in the bovine hypothalamus, the co-localizations of kisspeptin and neurokinin B (NKB) or kisspeptin and dynorphin A (Dyn) were examined. Hypothalamic tissue was collected from Japanese Black or Japanese Black \u00d7 Holstein crossbred cows during the follicular and luteal phases. Brain sections, including the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the preoptic area (POA), were dual immunostained with kisspeptin and either NKB or Dyn. In the ARC, both NKB and Dyn were co-localized in kisspeptin neurons during both the follicular and luteal phases, demonstrating the presence of kisspeptin/NKB/Dyn-containing neurons, referred to as KNDy neurons, in cows. In the POA, no co-localization of kisspeptin with either NKB or Dyn was detected. Kisspeptin expression in the follicular phase was higher than that in the luteal phase, suggesting that kisspeptin expression in the POA is positively controlled by estrogen in cows. The kisspeptin neuronal populations in the ARC and POA likely play important roles in regulating the GnRH pulse and surge, respectively, in cows.",

However, kisspeptin fibers and the kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) are detected throughout the brain suggesting that kisspeptin is involved in regulating the activity of multiple neuronal circuits. We provide here a review of kisspeptin actions on neuronal populations throughout the brain including the magnocellular oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, and cells within the arcuate nucleus, hippocampus, and amygdala. The actions of kisspeptin in these brain regions are compared to its effects upon GnRH neurons. Two major themes arise from this analysis. First, it is apparent that kisspeptin signaling through KISS1R at the GnRH neuron is a unique, extremely potent form or neurotransmission whereas kisspeptin actions through KISS1R in other brain regions exhibit neuromodulatory actions typical of other neuropeptides. Second, it is becoming increasingly likely that kisspeptin acts as a neuromodulator not only through KISS1R but also through other RFamide receptors such as the neuropeptide FF receptors (NPFFRs). We suggest likely locations of kisspeptin signaling through NPFFRs but note that only limited tools are presently available for examining kisspeptin cross-signaling within the RFamide family of neuropeptides.",

Two populations of kisspeptin neurones in the brain may control two modes of GnRH release to time the onset of puberty and regulate oestrous cyclicity in rats and mice. One population of kisspeptin neurones, located in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, appears to be responsible for the induction of the GnRH surge that leads to the luteinising hormone surge and ovulation. The other, located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, appears to be involved in generating GnRH pulses, resulting in luteinising hormone pulses followed by follicular development and steroidogenesis in the ovary. The present review focuses on the physiological role of the two populations of kisspeptin neurones in controlling gonadal functions by generating the two modes of GnRH release in a female rat model.",

However, in spite of wide kisspeptin receptor distribution in the brain, especially in the preoptic area and hypothalamus, the research focus has mostly been confined to the kisspeptin regulation on GnRH neurons. Here, by using medaka whose kisspeptin (kiss1) neurons have been clearly demonstrated to be regulated by sex steroids, we analyzed the anatomical distribution of kisspeptin receptors Gpr54-1 and Gpr54-2. Because the both receptors were shown to be activated by kisspeptins (Kiss1 and Kiss2), we analyzed the anatomical distribution of the both receptors by in situ hybridization. They were mainly expressed in the ventral telencephalon, preoptic area, and hypothalamus, which have been suggested to be involved in homeostatic functions including reproduction. First, we found gpr54-2 mRNA expression in nucleus preopticus pars magnocellularis and demonstrated that vasotocin and isotocin (Vasopressin and Oxytocin ortholog, respectively) neurons express gpr54-2 by dual in situ hybridization. Given that kisspeptin administration increases serum oxytocin and vasopressin concentration in mammals, the present finding are likely to be vertebrate-wide phenomenon, although direct regulation has not yet been demonstrated in mammals. We then analyzed co-expression of kisspeptin receptors in three types of GnRH neurons. It was clearly demonstrated that gpr54-expressing cells were located adjacent to GnRH1 neurons, although they were not GnRH1 neurons themselves. In contrast, there was no gpr54-expressing cell in the vicinities of neuromodulatory GnRH2 or GnRH3 neurons. From these results, we suggest that medaka kisspeptin neurons directly regulate some behavioral and neuroendocrine functions via vasotocin/isotocin neurons, whereas they do not regulate hypophysiotropic GnRH1 neurons at least in a direct manner. Thus, direct kisspeptin regulation of GnRH1 neurons proposed in mammals may not be the universal feature of vertebrate kisspeptin system in general.",

Physiological studies have indicated that these effects occur via a direct activation of the GnRH neurons, and at an unknown site in the median eminence or directly on the gonadotropes. Paradoxically, while the function of kisspeptin is relatively well understood, little data are available about the localization of kisspeptin neurons in the brain, and in particular the projection patterns of kisspeptin containing axons implicated in regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis. This review covers the current information about the localization of kisspeptin neurons in the mammalian brain and discusses the facts and artifacts of the methods of their detection. The available data suggest that kisspeptins are synthesized in neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus and the arcuate nucleus.

Recent findings in fishes are beginning to set a new stage for the kisspeptin study; the existence of paralogous kisspeptin genes as well as kisspeptin receptor (formerly called GPR54) genes has quite recently been reported in several fish and amphibian species. The fishes may provide excellent animal models for the study of general principles underlying the kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor systems of vertebrates from the evolutionary viewpoint. Unlike placental and marsupial mammalian species mainly studied so far, many teleost species have two paralogous genes of kisspeptin, kiss1 and kiss2. Medaka, Oryzias latipes, in which kiss1 and kiss2 are expressed in distinctive hypothalamic neuron populations, is a good model system for the study of central regulation of reproduction. Here, the kiss1 system but not the kiss2 system shows expression dynamics strongly indicative of its direct involvement in the HPG axis regulation via its actions on GnRH1 neurons. On the other hand, the kiss1 gene is missing, and only kiss2 is expressed in some fish species. Also, there are some recent reports that Kiss2 peptide may be a potent regulator of reproduction in some fish species. The ancestral vertebrate probably already had two paralogous kiss genes, and their main function was the HPG axis regulation. In the species that retained both paralogues during evolution, either Kiss1 or Kiss2 predominantly retains its ability for the HPG axis regulation, while the other may assume new non-reproductive functions (neofunctionalization). Alternatively, both the paralogues may assume complementary functions in the HPG axis regulation (subfunctionalization). After the divergence of teleost and tetrapod lineages, either one of the two paralogues, or even both in birds, have been lost (degradation) or became a pseudogene (non-functionalization), but the remaining paralogue retained its original function of HPG axis regulation. The identification of multiple forms of kisspeptin receptors and the rather promiscuous ligand-receptor relationships has led to the further proposal that such promiscuousness may be the basis for the functional robustness of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor systems in the HPG axis regulation, when one or both paralogous genes are lost or functionally partitioned during evolution.",

Similarly, KissR1 is expressed only in the habenula, while KissR2 is widely distributed in the brain, suggesting that the two kisspeptin systems play specific roles in the brain. The habenular Kiss1 is involved in the modulation of the raphe nuclei and serotonin-related behaviors such as fear response in the zebrafish.

Bioinformatic analyses have shown that there is a single gene for each kisspeptin (Kiss2) and its receptor (Kiss1r) in pufferfish, the function of which has yet to be elucidated. We cloned these two genes in grass puffer, which spawns on beach with semilunar cycles, and examined changes in their expression levels in the brain and pituitary at different reproductive stages over the spawning season. The Kiss2 precursor of 104 amino acid residues contains a putative kisspeptin peptide (SKFNLNPFGLRF). Kiss1r consists of 377 amino acid residues containing distinct characteristics of G-protein coupled receptors. Kiss2 and Kiss1r genes were expressed extensively in the brain, pituitary and gonads. The amounts of Kiss2 and Kiss1r mRNAs were significantly elevated during the spawning period in the brain and pituitary of both sexes. There were strong positive correlations between the amounts of Kiss2 and Kiss1r mRNAs in the brain and pituitary over the spawning season. Significant positive correlations were also observed between the amounts of Kiss2/Kiss1r mRNAs and GnRH1 mRNA in the brain. The present results indicate that the Kiss2/Kiss1r system most probably plays an important role in the regulation of reproductive function in the spawning period of grass puffer, possibly through the stimulation of GnRH1 secretion.

Little is known about kisspeptin in non-mammalian systems, and its interaction with aromatase remains unexamined. The Mallard drake is a seasonal breeder and an excellent model for studying the neural mechanisms that regulate the HPG. The goals of these studies were to determine (a) if and how kisspeptin regulates the drake HPG, (b) if kisspeptin and aromatase are expressed in the Mallard brain, and (c) if kisspeptin is co-localized or in apposition with, aromatase- and gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone (GnRH) positive neurons. Central kisspeptin administration increased plasma luteinizing hormone, an effect blocked by pretreatment with the GnRH antagonist, acyline, suggesting a conservation of kisspeptin function and mechanism of action in birds and mammals. The distribution of kisspeptin in the mallard brain was examined with immunocytochemistry (ICC). Neurons that express kisspeptin-like immunoreactive (ir) protein were observed in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) and in ir fibers throughout the drake brain. Virtually all POM kisspeptin-ir soma also expressed aromatase-ir, suggesting that autocrine mechanisms may predominate in the interaction between steroid provision and kisspeptin expression. No co-localization was observed between KP-ir and GnRH-ir, although both were easily detected in close-proximity in the tuberoinfundibular area. Taken together, these data suggest that in the drake, estradiol synthesized by aromatase and kisspeptin co-expressing POM neurons may regulate the HPG via an effect on GnRH secretion.",

These processes are considered to recapitulate early embryonic development from the blastocyst stage to the egg-cylinder stage. Formation of the primitive endoderm layer in the embryoid bodies was induced solely by aggregation of embryonic stem cells, in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor/STAT3 and serum/BMP4, which were considered to be sufficient for embryonic stem cell self-renewal.

Of interest, addition of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate, selectively repressed Nanog transcription without any detectable changes in upstream transcriptional regulators Oct3/4 and Sox2. Furthermore, sodium vanadate induced primitive endoderm differentiation, even in the inner cells of ES cell aggregates. Expression of Gata6 and Zfp42, two putative downstream Nanog effectors, was also increased and decreased by the addition of sodium vanadate, respectively, but these changes were eliminated by exogenous Nanog expression. The effects of sodium vanadate were abrogated by Grb2 deficiency or by the addition of the Mek inhibitor, PD98059. Indeed, PD98059 prevented Nanog repression induced by ES cell aggregation as well. Furthermore, transfection of a constitutive active Mek mutant into ES cells induced Nanog repression and primitive endoderm differentiation.

In addition, Nanog, Oct4 and repressor proteins co-occupy Nanog-target genes in mouse ES cells, suggesting that Nanog and Oct4 together may communicate with distinct repression complexes to control gene transcription. To our surprise, of the various core components in the NuRD complex with which Nanog and Oct4 interact, Mta1 was preferred, whereas Mbd3 and Rbbp7 were either absent or present at sub-stoichiometric levels. We named this unique Hdac1/2- and Mta1/2-containing complex NODE (for Nanog and Oct4 associated deacetylase). Interestingly, NODE contained histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity that seemed to be comparable to NuRD, and retained its association with Nanog and Oct4 in Mbd3(-/-) ES cells. In contrast to Mbd3 loss-of-function, knockdown of NODE subunits led to increased expression of developmentally regulated genes and ES-cell differentiation.

To get more insight in these processes, an RNAi experiment was performed on the mouse spermatogonial stem cell line GSDG1. Lipofectaminemediated transfection of siRNAs directed against Trp53 and Pten resulted in decreased expression levels as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The effects of knockdown were examined by determining the expression levels of genes that are involved in reprogramming and pluripotency of cells, specifically Nanog, Eras, c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Sox2. Additionally, the effects of TRP53 or PTEN knockdown on Plzf and Ddx4 expression were measured, which are highly expressed in spermatogonial stem cells and differentiating male germ cells, respectively. The main finding of this study is that knockdown of Trp53 and Pten independently resulted in significantly higher expression levels of the pluripotency-associated gene Nanog, and we hypothesize that TRP53 and PTEN mediated repression is important for the insulation of male germ cells from pluripotency.",

To facilitate the study of NANOG expression and regulation in viable hESC cultures, we generated fluorescent NANOG reporter cell lines by gene targeting in hESCs. In these reporter lines, the fluorescent reporter gene was co-expressed with endogenous NANOG and responded to experimental induction or repression of the NANOG promoter with appropriate changes in expression levels. Furthermore, NANOG reporter lines facilitated the separation of hESC populations based on NANOG expression levels and their subsequent characterization. Gene expression arrays on isolated hESC subpopulations revealed genes with differential expression in NANOG(high) and NANOG(low) hESCs, providing candidates for NANOG downstream targets hESCs.

Using eight functional assays that have previously been used to indicate PSC adaptation or transformation, Pten null embryonic stem cells (ESCs) failed to rate as significant in five of them.

Furthermore, our data show that the mechanism by which Pten null ECCs emerge in vitro and cause tumors in vivo is through increased survival and self-renewal, due to failed repression of the transcription factor Nanog.",

We report here that Nanog and Oct4 are reexpressed in two mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines following exposure to the differentiating agent DETA/NO. Both cell lines express a battery of both endoderm and mesoderm markers following induction of differentiation with DETA/NO-based protocols. Confocal analysis of cells undergoing directed differentiation shows that the majority of cells expressing Nanog express also endoderm genes such as Gata4 and FoxA2 (75.4% and 96.2%, resp.). Simultaneously, mRNA of mesodermal markers Flk1 and Mef2c are also regulated by the treatment. Acetylated histone H3 occupancy at the promoter of Nanog is involved in the process of reexpression. Furthermore, Nanog binding to the promoter of Brachyury leads to repression of this gene, thus disrupting mesendoderm transition.",

The mammalian SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) complex contains Brg1 or Brm as its core subunit, along with Brg1-associated factors. Our previous studies have addressed chromatin-remodeling of the Oct4 gene locus in retinoic acid (RA)-treated embryonal carcinoma cell line P19, which involves receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) for heterochromatinization on the proximal promoter region of this gene locus. However, the mechanism of RIP140 action in RA-triggered repressive chromatin-remodeling is unclear. The current study examines RA repression of the Nanog gene and compares the results with RA repression of the Oct4 gene on the chromatin level. The results show a loose nucleosome array on the Nanog gene promoter in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. On RA treatment, the Nanog gene locus remodels specifically in the CR1 region of its proximal promoter, with the insertion of a nucleosome and compaction of this region. Further, RA induces coordinated chromatin-remodeling of both Nanog and Oct4 gene loci, which requires RA receptor-\u03b1, RIP140 and Brm. Finally, in these RA-triggered repressive chromatin-remodeling processes, lysine acetylation of RIP140 is critical for its recruiting Brm.",

Current evidence suggests that ES cells maintain their pluripotent state by expressing a battery of transcription factors including Oct4 and Nanog. However, little is known about how ES cells maintain the expression of these pluripotent factors in ES cells. Here we present evidence that Oct4, Nanog, and FoxD3 form a negative feedback loop to maintain their expression in pluripotent ES cells. First, Oct4 maintains Nanog activity by directly activating its promoter at sub-steady-state concentration but repressing it at or above steady-state levels. On the other hand, FoxD3 behaves as a positive activator of Nanog to counter the repressive effect of Oct4. The expression of Oct4 is activated by FoxD3 and Nanog but repressed by Oct4 itself, thus, exerting an important negative feedback loop to limit its own activity. Indeed, overexpression of either FoxD3 or Nanog in ES cells failed to increase the concentration of Oct4 beyond the steady-state concentration, whereas knocking down either FoxD3 or Nanog reduces the expression of Oct4 in ES cells. Finally, overexpression of Oct4 or Nanog failed to compensate the loss of Nanog or Oct4, respectively, suggesting that both are required for ES self-renewal and pluripotency. Our results suggest the FoxD3-Nanog-Oct4 loop anchors an interdependent network of transcription factors that regulate stem cell pluripotency.",

Dissection of the regulatory networks downstream of these transcription factors has provided critical insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate ES cell pluripotency and early differentiation. Here we describe a role for Zic3, a member of the Gli family of zinc finger transcription factors, in the maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells. We show that Zic3 is expressed in ES cells and that this expression is repressed upon differentiation. The expression of Zic3 in pluripotent ES cells is also directly regulated by Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Targeted repression of Zic3 in human and mouse ES cells by RNA interference-induced expression of several markers of the endodermal lineage. Notably, the expression of Nanog, a key pluripotency regulator and repressor of extraembryonic endoderm specification in ES cells, was significantly reduced in Zic3 knockdown cells. This suggests that Zic3 may prevent endodermal marker expression through Nanog-regulated pathways. Thus our results extend the ES cell transcriptional network beyond Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, and further establish that Zic3 plays an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency by preventing endodermal lineage specification in embryonic stem cells.",

These critical factors have been implicated as both positive and negative regulators of transcription, varying by promoter and differentiation state of the cell. The Mediator complex, a ubiquitous conserved complex of approximately 30 subunits, facilitates transcription by coordinating RNA polymerase II binding to target promoters via gene-specific activators and can be divided into several functional subcomplexes. Med12 is part of a subcomplex of four proteins associated with the core Mediator complex and has been found to function both in repressing and activating transcription when recruited to target promoters. We identified an interaction between Med12 and Nanog and present evidence of involvement of Med12 in regulation of Nanog function. Gene expression analysis of embryonic stem cells knocked down for Med12 showed a similarity to Nanog knockdown, with increased expression of Nanog-repressed targets and decreased expression of Nanog-activated targets. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that Med12 and Nanog co-occupied Nanog target promoters in embryonic stem cells and that Med12 dissociated from target promoters upon differentiation with kinetics similar to Nanog. Our results indicate that Nanog and Med12 function in concert to regulate Nanog target genes and identify a novel role for Med12 in embryonic stem cell regulation.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the protein stability and activity of these factors in the developing embryo. Here we uncover an early developmental function for the Polycomb group member Bmi1 in supporting PrE lineage formation through Gata6 protein stabilization. We show that Bmi1 is enriched in the extraembryonic (endoderm [XEN] and trophectodermal stem [TS]) compartment and repressed by Nanog in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. In vivo, Bmi1 overlaps with the nascent Gata6 and Nanog protein from the eight-cell stage onward before it preferentially cosegregates with Gata6 in PrE progenitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Bmi1 interacts with Gata6 in a Ring finger-dependent manner to confer protection against Gata6 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. A direct role for Bmi1 in cell fate allocation is established by loss-of-function experiments in chimeric embryoid bodies. We thus propose a novel regulatory pathway by which Bmi1 action on Gata6 stability could alter the balance between Gata6 and Nanog protein levels to introduce a bias toward a PrE identity in a cell-autonomous manner.",

Knockout experiments indicate that Nanog functions as a key player in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. Importantly, Nanog expression is highly expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs) of E11.5 and E12.5 mouse embryos. However, its temporal and spatial expression pattern and function in germ cells are largely unknown. To address these issues, whole embryos and cryosections of embryos were immunostained with anti-NANOG and anti-STELLA/PGC7 antibodies. NANOG expression, repressed in colonized PGCs of E7.25-E7.5 embryos, became detectable in migrating PGCs of E7.75-E8.0 embryos. Both male and female PGCs migrating in E9.5 and E10.5 embryos and colonizing the genital ridges of E11.5 and E12.5 embryos were positive for NANOG immunostaining, while the NANOG expression pattern differed between the sexes in the later developmental stage. In female gonadal PGCs of E13.5 and E14.5 embryos, NANOG became undetectable in germ cells positive for the synaptonemal complex-specific protein SCP3, while in male PGCs of E14.5-E16.5 embryos, the number of NANOG-positive germ cells drastically decreased during the mitotic arrest. No germ cells positive for NANOG were detectable in testes and ovaries of adult mice.

Self-renewal of mouse ES cells depends on activation of Stat3 by leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in collaboration with bone morphogenetic protein signalling. The transcription factor Nanog is essential in maintaining pluripotency but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here we examine the functional interactions of Nanog with the Stat3 and NFkappaB pathways. Nanog and Stat3 were found to bind to and synergistically activate Stat3-dependent promoters. We also found that Nanog binds to NFkappaB proteins; however, Nanog binding inhibited transcriptional activity of NFkappaB proteins. Endogenous NFkappaB activity and target-gene expression increased during differentiation of ES cells. Overexpression of NFkappaB proteins promoted differentiation, whereas inhibition of NFkappaB signalling, either by genetic ablation of the Ikbkg gene or overexpression of the IkappaBalpha super-repressor, increased expression of pluripotency markers. We conclude that Nanog represses the pro-differentiation activities of NFkappaB and cooperates with Stat3 to maintain pluripotency.",

Genome-wide mapping of transcriptional networks in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) reveals that many endogenous noncoding RNA molecules, including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), may play a role in controlling the pluripotent state. We performed a genome-wide screen that combined full-length mESC transcriptome genomic mapping data with chromatin immunoprecipitation genomic location maps of the key mESC transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. We henceforth identified four mESC-expressed, conserved lncRNA-encoding genes residing proximally to active genomic binding sites of Oct4 and Nanog. Accordingly, these four genes have potential roles in pluripotency. We show that two of these lncRNAs, AK028326 (Oct4-activated) and AK141205 (Nanog-repressed), are direct targets of Oct4 and Nanog. Most importantly, we demonstrate that these lncRNAs are not merely controlled by mESC transcription factors, but that they themselves regulate developmental state: knockdown and overexpression of these transcripts lead to robust changes in Oct4 and Nanog mRNA levels, in addition to alterations in cellular lineage-specific gene expression and in the pluripotency of mESCs. We further characterize AK028326 as a co-activator of Oct4 in a regulatory feedback loop. These results for the first time implicate lncRNAs in the modulation of mESC pluripotency and expand the established mESC regulatory network model to include functional lncRNAs directly controlled by key mESC transcription factors.",

At the time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed between blood and plasma concentrations from concurrently collected samples in a phase 1 (healthy subjects) and phase 2 (target patient population) study using graphical and population PK approaches. This integrated information was presented to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory input. Following regulatory concurrence, DBS was poised for use in further clinical studies.

Furthermore, in many studies the selective constraint at such sites in primates was claimed to be more stringent than that in rodents. Given the larger effective population sizes in rodents than in primates, the theoretical expectation is that selection in rodents would be more effective than that in primates. To resolve this contradiction between expectations and observations, we used processed pseudogenes as a model for strict neutral evolution, and estimated selective constraint on synonymous sites using the rate of substitution at pseudosynonymous and pseudononsynonymous sites in pseudogenes as the neutral expectation. After controlling for the effects of GC content, our results were similar to those from previous studies, i.e., synonymous sites in primates exhibited evidence for higher selective constraint that those in rodents. Specifically, our results indicated that in primates up to 24% of synonymous sites could be under purifying selection, while in rodents synonymous sites evolved neutrally. To further control for shifts in GC content, we estimated selective constraint at fourfold degenerate sites using a maximum parsimony approach. This allowed us to estimate selective constraint using mutational patterns that cause a shift in GC content (GT \u2194 TG, CT \u2194 TC, GA \u2194 AG, and CA \u2194 AC) and ones that do not (AT \u2194 TA and CG \u2194 GC). Using this approach, we found that synonymous sites evolve neutrally in both primates and rodents. Apparent deviations from neutrality were caused by a higher rate of C \u2192 A and C \u2192 T mutations in pseudogenes. Such differences are most likely caused by the shift in GC content experienced by pseudogenes.

After becoming febrile, he developed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and hemodynamic instability, and soon after was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and decreased consciousness. Plasma exchange was initiated but subsequently stopped when positive blood cultures grew a gram-negative organism. The patient progressively improved following therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, which was switched to imipenem, then meropenem when Capnocytophaga was identified. There is a common misconception amongst practitioners that the presence of systemic infection excludes the possibility of TTP and vice versa. This case emphasizes that TTP may occur secondary to a systemic infection, thereby allowing the two processes to coexist. It is important to maintain a wide differential when considering the diagnosis of either TTP or C. canimorsus infection since delays in treatment may have fatal consequences.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608484": "Animal bites represent a significant global health problem and account for approximately 1-2% of all visits to the emergency department. The vast majority of animal bite injuries are inflicted by dogs (80-90%,) and cats (5-15%). The most common complication following an animal bite is a wound infection, which tends to be polymicrobial and include both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria mainly of oropharyngeal origin. The likelihood of a cat bite becoming infected is double of that of a dog bite. Pasteurella spp. predominates in infected dog and cat bites. Dog bite injuries can be also associated with Capnocytophaga canimorsus, an aggressive organism which can cause disseminated infections (sepsis) and death, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Early aggressive local wound cleansing is the most important therapy to prevent infection after animal bites. Due to the polymicrobial etiology of infected bite wounds, broad-spectrum antibiotics, covering both aerobic and anerobic bacteria, are often recommended as empiric treatment of animal bites.",

The patient's presentation to the emergency room late in the course of the infection probably effected her death. C canimorsus should be strongly suspected in any case of septicemia following a dog bite. Prompt therapy may influence the potentially fatal course of systemic infection.

At autopsy Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome was identified and Capnocytophaga canimorsus was subsequently isolated on antemortem blood cultures. Infection of humans with this organism is most often due to dog bite or contact. Upon specific inquiry it was ascertained that 2 days before admission the deceased had suffered a superficial bite to his hand by his pet Staffordshire Bullterrier dog. His relevant history included a previous splenectomy following blunt abdominal trauma. Asplenia and hyposplenia at autopsy should prompt microbiological testing with consideration of unusual organisms such as C. canimorsus. Although histories of animal contact or injury are often not available at the time of autopsy, this should also be considered in cases of apparent fulminant sepsis.

This review compiled all laboratory-confirmed cases, animal sources, and virulence attributes to describe its epidemiology, clinical features, and pathogenesis. An estimated 484 patients with a median age of 55 years were reported, two-thirds of which were male. The case-fatality rate was about 26%. Its clinical presentations included severe sepsis and fatal septic shock, gangrene of the digits or extremities, high-grade bacteremia, meningitis, endocarditis, and eye infections. Predispositions were prior splenectomy in 59 patients and alcoholism in 58 patients. Dog bites before illness occurred in 60%; additionally, in 27%, there were scratches, licking, or other contact with dogs or cats. Patients with meningitis showed more advanced ages, higher male preponderance, lower mortality, and longer incubation periods after dog bites than patients with sepsis (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with prior splenectomy presented more frequently with high-grade bacteremia than patients with intact spleens (p &lt; 0.05). The organism possesses virulence attributes of catalase and sialidase production, gliding motility, cytotoxin production, and resistance to killing by serum complement due to its unique lipopolysaccharide.

The limbs showed distal amputation of the fingers in both hands and feet, oligodactyly associated with syndactyly in the left foot, ring constriction in the right leg, the presence of right hyperextension, and clubfoot. The upper limbs showed length discrepancies. Karyotype analysis was normal at 46 XY.

The authors believe that the second theory explain the occurrence of ABS. The outcome of the disease during pregnancy depends on the gravity of the malformations. Interruption of the pregnancy is usually proposed when diagnosis of severe craniofacial and visceral abnormalities is confirmed. Whereas minor limb defects can be repaired with postnatal surgery.

Literature reports association of amniotic band syndrome and acrania postnatally, but not diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound. A young woman, gravida 1, para 0, presented for an initial prenatal visit at 35 weeks' gestation and had a first ultrasound that showed a single intrauterine pregnancy at 36 weeks' gestation. This ultrasound also showed polyhydramnios, absence of or a very small cerebrum with either anencephaly or acrania. A targeted ultrasound scan was performed on the following day, which confirmed acrania in view of the fact that we did see an absence of the flat bones of the skull with a substantial amount of abnormal brain tissue present surrounded by a fetal membrane. The patient was counseled, and labor induction was scheduled with a male infant delivered weighing 1763 g after a spontaneous vaginal delivery. The infant was diagnosed with acrania, given supportive care, and died 11 hours later. Diagnosis of cranial bone defects can be established by ultrasound in the first trimester of pregnancy.

It has been speculated that, without treatment, amputation or severe dysfunction of the limb may occur. Despite these potential complications, surgical treatment for this selected group of fetuses has not been previously performed. We report two cases that were successfully treated using novel minimally invasive surgical techniques. The cases involved fetuses with amniotic band syndrome with associated limb constriction in which the amniotic band was surgically interrupted to avoid spontaneous amputation of the extremity. Adequate blood flow distal to the obstruction was preserved and significant functional improvement of the extremity occurred in both cases, preserving the limbs. These cases represent the first prenatal surgical intervention successfully used to treat constricting amniotic bands in humans.

To evaluate the prevalence of, risk factors for, and the outcome of postprocedural amniotic band disruption sequence after fetoscopic laser surgery in twin-twin transfusion syndrome cases. All consecutive cases of twin-twin transfusion syndrome treated with fetoscopic laser coagulation of the vascular anastomoses at our center between January 2002 and March 2019 were included in the study. The occurrence of postprocedural amniotic band disruption sequence in these cases was recorded, and the potential risk factors were analyzed. Postprocedural amniotic band disruption sequence was detected, at birth, in 2.2% (15/672) of twin-twin transfusion syndrome cases treated with fetoscopic laser surgery, in both the recipients (10/15, 67%) and the donors (5/15, 33%). Postprocedural amniotic band disruption sequence primarily affected the lower extremities (11/15, 73%) and, less frequently, the upper extremities (2/15, 13%), both the upper and lower extremities (1/15, 7%), or the umbilical cord (1/15, 7%). Postprocedural amniotic band disruption sequence led to the amputation of toes in 5 of 15 cases (33%) and resulted in fetal demise because of constriction of the umbilical cord in 1 case (7%). The independent risk factors identified for postprocedural amniotic band disruption sequence were lower gestational age at laser surgery (odds ratio per week, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.79; P=.003) and the presence of postprocedural chorioamniotic membrane separation on antenatal ultrasound examination (odds ratio, 41.66; 95% confidence interval, 5.44-319.25; P&lt;.001).

Healthy subjects (n = 20) received single oral doses of the modified Cooperstown 5+1 cocktail drugs (midazolam [CYP3A], caffeine [CYP1A2], warfarin + vitamin K [CYP2C9], omeprazole [CYP2C19], and dextromethorphan [CYP2D6]) without upadacitinib and on day 11 (midazolam) or 12 (all other probes) of a 15-day regimen of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily (extended-release formulation). Serial blood samples and 12-hour urine samples were collected for assays of the probe substrates and select metabolites. The ratio (90%CI) of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub> ) central values when the cocktail drugs were administered with upadacitinib relative to when administered alone were 0.74 (0.68-0.80) for midazolam, 1.22 (1.15-1.29) for caffeine, 1.11 (1.07-1.15) for S-warfarin, 1.07 (0.95-1.22) for dextromethorphan, and 0.82 (0.72-0.94) for omeprazole.

Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, is the first approved JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA and has been shown to be effective in managing disease. However, in phase 2 dose-ranging studies tofacitinib was associated with dose-limiting tolerability and safety issues such as anemia. Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is a selective JAK1 inhibitor that was engineered to address the hypothesis that greater JAK1 selectivity over other JAK family members will translate into a more favorable benefit:risk profile. Upadacitinib selectively targets JAK1 dependent disease drivers such as IL-6 and IFN\u03b3, while reducing effects on reticulocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, which potentially contributed to the tolerability issues of tofacitinib. Structure-based hypotheses were used to design the JAK1 selective inhibitor upadacitinib. JAK family selectivity was defined with in vitro assays including biochemical assessments, engineered cell lines, and cytokine stimulation. In vivo selectivity was defined by the efficacy of upadacitinib and tofacitinib in a rat adjuvant induced arthritis model, activity on reticulocyte deployment, and effect on circulating NK cells. The translation of the preclinical JAK1 selectivity was assessed in healthy volunteers using ex vivo stimulation with JAK-dependent cytokines. Here, we show the structural basis for the JAK1 selectivity of upadacitinib, along with the in vitro JAK family selectivity profile and subsequent in vivo physiological consequences. Upadacitinib is ~ 60 fold selective for JAK1 over JAK2, and &gt; 100 fold selective over JAK3 in cellular assays. While both upadacitinib and tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy in a rat model of arthritis, the increased selectivity of upadacitinib for JAK1 resulted in a reduced effect on reticulocyte deployment and NK cell depletion relative to efficacy. Ex vivo pharmacodynamic data obtained from Phase I healthy volunteers confirmed the JAK1 selectivity of upadactinib in a clinical setting. The data presented here highlight the JAK1 selectivity of upadacinitinib and supports its use as an effective therapy for the treatment of RA with the potential for an improved benefit:risk profile.",

In the last few decades, the management of RA has been dramatically improved by the introduction of a treat-to-target approach aiming to prevent joint damage progression. Moreover, the increasing knowledge about disease pathogenesis allowed the development of a new drug class of biologic agents targeted on immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines involved in RA network. Despite the introduction of several targeted drugs, a significant proportion of RA patients still fail to achieve the clinical target; so, more recently the focus of research has been shifted toward the inhibition of kinases involved in the transduction of the inflammatory signal into immune cells. In particular, two Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, baricitinib and tofacitinib, have been licensed for the treatment of RA as a consequence of a very favorable profile observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted across different RA subpopulations. Both these new compounds are active on the majority of four JAK family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2), whereas the most recent emerging approach is directed toward the development of JAK1 selective inhibitors (upadacitinib and filgotinib) with the aim to improve the safety profile by minimizing the effects on JAK3 and, especially, JAK2. In this narrative review, we discuss the rationale for JAK inhibition in RA, with a special focus on the role of JAK1 selective blockade and a detailed description of available data from the results of clinical trials on upadacitinib and filgotinib.",

Interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL-2R\u03b1) is expressed in the leukemic cells of smoldering/chronic ATL patients, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and spontaneous proliferation. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway also plays a critical role in ATL cell survival and proliferation. We previously performed a high-throughput screen that demonstrated additive/synergistic activity of Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with AZD8055, an mTORC1/C2 inhibitor. However, effects of unintended JAK2 inhibition with Ruxolitinib limits it therapeutic potential for ATL patients, which lead us to evaluate a JAK1-specific inhibitor.

However, there are still several unmet needs in the treatment of atopic dermatitis concerning long-term efficacy, tolerability, safety, route of administration, and cost. The increased knowledge of atopic dermatitis pathogenesis and the role of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways has allowed the development of new compounds to inhibit this intracellular signaling pathway implicated in atopic dermatitis-related immune responses. Currently, JAK inhibitors are an important focus of therapeutic research for atopic dermatitis.

In the past two decades, the advent of biologic agents that target specific components of the immune response has greatly improved the care of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, not all patients respond or maintain response to biologic therapy and some patients develop adverse events that necessitate treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, sensitization with formation of anti-drug antibodies is an inherent limitation to administration of monoclonal antibodies. This circumstance has generated renewed interest in the development of novel oral small-molecule drugs (SMDs) that are effective and well tolerated. Several classes of SMDs are currently progressing through the pipeline and offer the promise of oral delivery and high potency. In this review, we summarize different mechanisms of oral drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, highlight key findings from phase II and III randomized trials of novel oral SMDs, and discuss how oral SMDs are likely to be integrated into future IBD treatment paradigms. The most advanced development programs currently involve evaluation of compounds blocking Janus kinase (JAK) receptors or modulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Tofacitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC. Several more selective JAK-1 inhibitors, including filgotinib and upadacitinib, have also shown positive results in phase II studies and are currently enrolling in phase III development programs. Similarly, ozanimod, an S1P1 and S1P5 receptor agonist, has shown early favorable results and is enrolling in phase III trials. As these and other novel oral SMDs come to market, several questions will need to be answered. The cost effectiveness, comparative treatment efficacy, predictors of response, and relative safety of oral SMDs compared to existing therapies will need to be evaluated. Given the modest efficacy rates observed with both biologic therapies and novel SMDs to date, the potential for combination therapy based on a non-sensitizing oral option is promising and may be facilitated by development of organ-specific therapies with pharmacodynamic activity restricted to the gut to minimize systemic toxicity.",

This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 150 sites in 35 countries. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with active rheumatoid arthritis for 3 months or longer, who had received csDMARDs for at least 3 months with a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before study entry, and had an inadequate response to at least one of the following csDMARDs: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. Using interactive response technology, we randomly assigned patients receiving stable background csDMARDs (2:2:1:1) to receive a once-daily extended-release formulation of upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg, or placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients, investigators, and the funder were masked to allocation. After 12 weeks, patients taking placebo received 15 mg or 30 mg of upadacitinib once daily, according to the prespecified randomisation assignment. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients at week 12 who achieved 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20), and a 28-joint disease activity score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) of 3\u00b72 or less.

Upadacitinib selectively inhibits Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) which could potentially reduce JAK2 and JAK3-related side effects. <b>Areas covered</b>: In this paper, we review a newly developed oral selective JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib for the treatment of RA. The doses of upadacitinib extended-release 15 and 30 mg daily selected in phase III RA studies have shown a near-maximum efficacy in phase II studies. Upadacitinib inhibited radiographic progression and displayed rapid and sustained clinical and functional efficacy in RA when in combination with methotrexate (MTX), upadacitinib was superior to placebo in MTX-Inadequate Responders (IRs) and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs-IRs while as monotherapy, it was superior to MTX in MTX-IRs and MTX-na\u00efve patients. Upadacitinib was superior to adalimumab using ACR70, reduction of pain-VAS and improvement of HAQ-DI. The comparison with abatacept is still ongoing. <b>Expert commentary</b>: Upadacitinib has displayed a rapid and favorable efficacy profile in RA but despite being a selective JAK1 inhibitor appears to have a similar safety profile to less-selective Jakinibs. Longer term safety data are awaited.",

Upadacitinib was evaluated in Phase 3 studies as an oral extended-release (ER) formulation administered once daily. The purpose of this study was to develop a level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for upadacitinib ER formulation. The pharmacokinetics of four upadacitinib extended-release formulations with different in vitro release characteristics and an immediate-release capsule formulation of upadacitinib were evaluated in 20 healthy subjects in a single-dose, randomized, crossover study. In vivo pharmacokinetic data and in vitro dissolution data (USP Dissolution Apparatus 1; pH 6.8; 100 rpm) were used to establish a level A IVIVC. Three formulations were used to establish the IVIVC, and the fourth formulation was used for external validation. A non-linear IVIVC best described the relationship between upadacitinib in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption profiles. The absolute percent prediction errors (%PE) for upadacitinib C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were less than 10% for all three formulations used to establish the IVIVC, as well as for the %PE for the external validation formulation and the overall mean internal validation. Model was cross-validated using the leave-one-out approach; all evaluated cross-validation runs met the regulatory acceptance criteria. A level A IVIVC was successfully developed and validated for upadacitinib ER formulation, which meets the FDA and EMA regulatory validation criteria and can be used as surrogate for in vivo bioequivalence.",

The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single upadacitinib dose in subjects with normal renal function and in subjects with renal impairment. A total of 24 subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years were assigned to 1 of 4 renal function groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (normal, mild, moderate, severe; N = 6/group). A single 15-mg dose of upadacitinib extended-release formulation was administered under fasting conditions. Serial plasma and urine samples were assayed to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on upadacitinib exposure through regression analysis and analysis of covariance. The primary analysis was the regression analysis of upadacitinib exposures versus estimated glomerular filtration rate. The point estimates for upadacitinib plasma exposure ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were 1.18 (90%CI, 1.06-1.32), 1.33 (90%CI, 1.11-1.59), and 1.44 (90%CI, 1.14-1.82) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve and 1.06 (90%CI, 0.92-1.23), 1.11 (90%CI, 0.88-1.40), and 1.14 (90%CI, 0.84-1.56) for maximum observed plasma concentration, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function based on the regression analysis. The analysis of covariance categorical analysis provided consistent results. Upadacitinib was well tolerated by all subjects, and no safety issues were identified in subjects with renal impairment. Renal impairment has a limited effect on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. This is in agreement with the known limited role of urinary excretion in upadacitinib elimination. Based on the limited impact on exposure, no dose adjustment is necessary for upadacitinib in subjects with impaired renal function.",

To date, three JAK inhibitors have been tested in patients with moderate-to-severe CD: tofacitinib (pan-JAK inhibitor), filgotinib (JAK1 inhibitor) and upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). Clinical development of tofacitinib was discontinued in CD because the primary endpoint of clinical remission in the phase II induction and maintenance trials was not met, although outcomes may have been influenced by trial design flaws and a high placebo rate was noted. In contrast, filgotinib did meet its primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 10 in the phase II FITZROY trial, in addition to several other clinically important secondary outcomes, spurring a subsequent larger phase III trial. Following promising results for upadacitinib in its phase II trial, larger phase III trials were also initiated to corroborate the efficacy results. Although JAK inhibitors appear to have an acceptable safety profile, higher rates of infections compared to placebo were noted. Overall, JAK inhibitors constitute a new promising class of drugs, given the efficacy signals observed in pivotal clinical trials in several chronic inflammatory diseases.

The results of this study indicated that NPRA may play a role in cardiac metabolism, which could be mediated by circRNA through endogenous competition mechanisms.

The present study aimed to determine the role of NPR-C in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. The Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were used in this study. Animals were matched according to their age and weight, and then placed on either a high-salt (HS, 8%) or a normal-salt (NS, 0.4%) diet for 6 weeks randomly using random number table. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasmatic sodium concentration (PLNa), urinary sodium excretion (UVNa), and serum creatinine concentration (Scr) were measured. The concentration of ANP in blood and tissues (heart and kidney) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of ANP, NPR-A, and NPR-C in kidney was evaluated with western blot analysis. Regarding renal redox state, the concentration changes in malondialdehyde (MDA), lipofuscin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in kidney were detected by a spectrophotometric method. The kidney damage was evaluated using pathological techniques and the succinodehydrogenase (SDHase) examination. Furthermore, after an intra-peritoneal injection of C-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)4-23 (C-ANP4-23), an NPR-C receptor agonist, the SBP, biochemical values in blood and urine, and renal redox state were evaluated. The paired Student's t test and analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test were performed for statistical analyses of the comparisons between two groups and multiple groups, respectively. The baseline SBP in all groups was within the normal range. At the end of the 6-week experiment, HS diet significantly increased the SBP in DS rats from 116.63 \u00b1 2.90 mmHg to 162.25 \u00b1 2.15 mmHg (t = -10.213, P &lt; 0.001). The changes of SBP were not significant in DS rats on an NS diet and DR rats on an NS diet or on an HS diet (all P &gt; 0.05). The significant increase of PLNa, UVNa, and Scr related to an HS diet was found in both DS and DR rats (all P &lt; 0.05). However, significant changes in the concentration (t = -21.915, P &lt; 0.001) and expression of renal ANP (t = -3.566, P = 0.016) and the expression of renal NPR-C (t = 5.864, P = 0.002) were only observed in DS hypertensive rats. The significantly higher desmin immunochemical staining score (t = -5.715, P = 0.005) and mitochondrial injury score (t = -6.325, P = 0.003) accompanied by the lower SDHase concentration (t = 3.972, P = 0.017) revealed mitochondrial pathologic abnormalities in podocytes in DS rats with an HS diet. The distinct increases of MDA (t = -4.685, P = 0.009), lipofuscin (t = -8.195, P = 0.001), and Nox (t = -12.733, P &lt; 0.001) but not NOS (t = -0.328, P = 0.764) in kidneys were also found in DS hypertensive rats. C-ANP4-23 treatment significantly decreased the SBP induced by HS in DS rats (P &lt; 0.05), which was still higher than NS groups with the vehicle or C-ANP4-23 treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the HS-induced increase of MDA, lipofuscin, Nox concentrations, and Nox4 expression in DS rats was significantly attenuated by C-ANP4-23 treatment as compared with those with HS diet and vehicle injection (all P &lt; 0.05). The results indicated that the renal NPR-C might be involved in the salt-sensitive hypertension through the damage of mitochondria in podocytes and the reduction of the anti-oxidative function. Hence, C-ANP4-23 might serve as a therapeutic agent in treating salt-sensitive hypertension.",

Recent studies, however, showed that an alternative mode of cell death, autophagy, is involved in the response to anticancer drugs. The specific role of autophagy and its relationship to apoptosis remains, nevertheless, controversial: it can either lead to cell survival or can function in cell death. We show that dexamethasone induced autophagy upstream of apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Inhibition of autophagy by siRNA-mediated repression of Beclin 1 expression inhibited apoptosis showing an important role of autophagy in dexamethasone-induced cell death. Dexamethasone treatment caused an upregulation of promyelocytic leukemia protein, PML, its complex formation with protein kinase B or Akt and a PML-dependent Akt dephosphorylation. Initiation of autophagy and the onset of apoptosis were both dependent on these events. PML knockout thymocytes were resistant to dexamethasone-induced death and upregulation of PML correlated with the ability of dexamethasone to kill primary leukemic cells. Our data reveal key mechanisms of dexamethasone-induced cell death that may inform the development of improved treatment protocols for lymphoid malignancies.",

Pharmacological prevention of tachycardia-induced ionic remodeling not only with \"classical\" antiarrhythmics but also with drugs which provide a basis for some of the pillars of the so-called \"upstream\" therapy of AF like corticosteroids or statins has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. Amongst other ion currents, atrial sodium current I(Na) and its tachycardia-induced alterations play an important role in AF pathophysiology. Thus, effects of a dexamethasone (DT) and atorvastatin treatment (AT) on atrial sodium current I(Na) and its tachycardia-induced remodeling were studied in a rabbit model. 9 groups with 4 animals were examined. Atrial pacemaker leads were implanted in all animals. No rapid atrial pacing (600/min) was performed in the control group but for 24 or 120 hours in the respective pacing groups. Instrumentation and pacing did not differ from the respective drug groups but an additional treatment with dexamethasone or atorvastatin (7 days) was performed. Rapid atrial pacing (RAP, 600/min) reduced I(Na) after 24 hours (\u2248 -50%) with no further reduction after 120 hours. DT reduced I(Na) (\u2248 -20%), current densities in consecutively tachypaced animals did not differ from those in untreated animals. AT reduced INa similar as RAP, subsequent RAP did not further diminish I(Na).

Here, we tested whether aGvHD therapy could be improved by delivering GCs with the help of inorganic-organic hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NPs) that preferentially target myeloid cells. IOH-NPs containing the GC betamethasone (BMP-NPs) efficiently reduced morbidity, mortality, and tissue damage in a totally MHC mismatched mouse model of aGvHD. Therapeutic activity was lost in mice lacking the GC receptor (GR) in myeloid cells, confirming the cell type specificity of our approach. BMP-NPs had no relevant systemic activity but suppressed cytokine and chemokine gene expression locally in the small intestine, which presumably explains their mode of action. Most importantly, BMP-NPs delayed the development of an adoptively transferred B cell lymphoma better than the free drug, although the overall incidence was unaffected. Our findings thus suggest that employing IOH-NPs could diminish the risk of relapse associated with GC therapy of aGvHD patients while still allowing to efficiently ameliorate the disease.",

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between dietary Dex and recoverable intestinal microbial profile in broilers to better understand mode of action and refine future uses of the model. Three experiments were conducted that administered Dex-treated feed for one week in conjunction with the antibiotics BMD (bacitracin methylene disalicylate) or Baytril<sup>\u00ae</sup> (enrofloxacin) to evaluate if enteric microbial mechanisms were important in Dex-induced permeability. Serum fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-d) and bacterial translocation (BT) have been reported to increase after Dex treatment and were used to assess gut epithelial leakage. Shifts in bacterial profiles were also measured on selective agar. Combining Dex with BMD or Baytril resulted in increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) serum FITC-d versus Dex-only. Additionally, Baytril did not reduce aerobic BT and bacterial profiles remained similar after Dex.

Instead, GC treatment was compromised in mice expressing a defective GR in the nonhematopoietic compartment or selectively lacking the GR in airway epithelial cells. Further, we found that an intact GR dimerization interface was a prerequisite for the suppression of AAI and airway hyperresponsiveness by GCs. Our observation that the ability of dexamethasone to modulate gene expression in airway epithelial cells coincided with its potency to resolve AAI supports a crucial role for transcriptional regulation by the GR in this cell type.

Recent mouse studies showed that HO was significantly inhibited by systemic treatment with a corticosteroid or the retinoic acid receptor \u03b3 agonist Palovarotene. Because these drugs act differently, the data raised intriguing questions including whether the drugs affected HO via similar means, whether a combination therapy would be more effective or whether the drugs may hamper each other's action. To tackle these questions, we used an effective HO mouse model involving subcutaneous implantation of Matrigel plus rhBMP2, and compared the effectiveness of prednisone, dexamathaosone, Palovarotene or combination of. Each corticosteroid and Palovarotene reduced bone formation at max doses, and a combination therapy elicited similar outcomes without obvious interference. While Palovarotene had effectively prevented the initial cartilaginous phase of HO, the steroids appeared to act more on the bony phase. In reporter assays, dexamethasone and Palovarotene induced transcriptional activity of their respective GRE or RARE constructs and did not interfere with each other's pathway. Interestingly, both drugs inhibited the activity of a reporter construct for the inflammatory mediator NF-\u03baB, particularly in combination. In good agreement, immunohistochemical analyses showed that both drugs markedly reduced the number of mast cells and macrophages near and within the ectopic Matrigel mass and reduced also the number of progenitor cells. In sum, corticosteroids and Palovarotene appear to block HO via common and distinct mechanisms. Most importantly, they directly or indirectly inhibit the recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells present at the affected site, thus alleviating the effects of key HO instigators.",

However, it is also desirable to investigate the effects of complex mixtures on complex systems such as living cells including the natural multitude of signalling pathways. Evidence based on herbal medicine has motivated us to investigate potential beneficial health effects of Mucor racemosus (M rac) extracts. Secondary metabolites of M rac were collected using a good-manufacturing process (GMP) approved production line and a validated manufacturing process, in order to obtain a stable product termed SyCircue (National Drug Code USA: 10424-102). Toxicological studies confirmed that this product does not contain mycotoxins and is non-genotoxic. Potential effects on inflammatory processes were investigated by treating stimulated cells with M rac extracts and the effects were compared to the standard anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone on the levels of the proteome and metabolome. Using 2D-PAGE, slight anti-inflammatory effects were observed in primary white blood mononuclear cells, which were more pronounced in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Proteome profiling based on nLC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests revealed inhibitory effects of M rac extracts on pro-inflammatory cytoplasmic mediators and secreted cytokines and chemokines in these endothelial cells. This finding was confirmed using targeted proteomics, here treatment of stimulated cells with M rac extracts down-regulated the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL5 and GROA significantly. Finally, the modulating effects of M rac on HUVECs were also confirmed on the level of the metabolome. Several metabolites displayed significant concentration changes upon treatment of inflammatory activated HUVECs with the M rac extract, including spermine and lysophosphatidylcholine acyl C18:0 and sphingomyelin C26:1, while the bulk of measured metabolites remained unaffected. Interestingly, the effects of M rac treatment on lipids were orthogonal to the effect of dexamethasone underlining differences in the overall mode of action.",

Dexamethasone (Dex) with suitable dosage can enhance BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation. To strengthen this synergistic osteoinductive effect, a pH-responsive chitosan-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticle (chi-MSN) ensemble was fabricated for dual-delivery of BMP-2 and Dex. The MSNs are prepared by a CTAB-templated sol-gel method, and further coated by chitosan via the crosslinking of glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS). The small Dex is encapsulated in the mesopores and the large BMP-2 is incorporated into the chitosan coating. These chi-MSNs can quickly release BMP-2 in a bioactive form and can then be efficiently endocytosed and further realize a controlled release of Dex with the decreased pH value into/in cells. With the synergistic action of BMP-2 and Dex outside and inside the cell, this dual hybrid delivery system can significantly stimulate osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Together, this dual-delivery strategy for osteogenic protein delivery may enhance clinical outcomes by retaining the bioactivity and optimizing the release mode of the drug/protein.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29449600": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent anti-inflammatory drugs whose mode of action is complex and still debatable. One likely cellular target of GCs are monocytes/macrophages. The role of GCs in monocyte survival is also debated. Although both granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) are important regulators of macrophage lineage functions including their survival, the former is often associated with proinflammatory functions while the latter is important in lineage homeostasis. We report here that the GC, dexamethasone, induces apoptosis in GM-CSF-treated human monocytes while having no impact on M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. To understand how GCs, GM-CSF, and M-CSF are regulating monocyte survival and other functions during inflammation, we firstly examined the transcriptomic changes elicited by these three agents in human monocytes, either acting alone or in combination. Transcriptomic and Ingenuity pathway analyses found that dexamethasone differentially modulated dendritic cell maturation and TREM1 signaling pathways in GM-CSF-treated and M-CSF-treated monocytes, two pathways known to be regulated by ERK1/2 activity. These analyses led us to provide evidence that the GC inhibits ERK1/2 activity selectively in GM-CSF-treated monocytes to induce apoptosis. It is proposed that this inhibition of ERK1/2 activity leads to inactivation of p90 ribosomal-S6 kinase and Bad dephosphorylation leading in turn to enhanced caspase-3 activity and subsequent apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of GC receptor activity restored the ERK1/2 signaling and prevented the GC-induced apoptosis in GM-CSF-treated monocytes. Increased tissue macrophage numbers, possibly from enhanced survival due to mediators such as GM-CSF, can correlate with inflammatory disease severity; also reduction in these numbers can correlate with the therapeutic benefit of a number of agents, including GCs. We propose that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway promotes survival of GM-CSF-treated proinflammatory monocytes, which can be selectively targeted by GCs as a novel mechanism to reduce local monocyte/macrophage numbers and hence inflammation.",

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD001415-23. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced upregulation of proteins such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL2, and GRO\u03b1 was confirmed, however, with strong quantitative interindividual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to downregulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. Although most consequences of dexamethasone were found to be compatible with the expected mode of action, some unexpected but significant observations may be related to adverse effects.",

Significant improvement in ischemic flap survival was found with dexamethasone and BW755C.

In the present study, we used an in vitro model to examine the requirement for protein synthesis for dexamethasone to suppress the release of immunoreactive (ir)-PRL release from the rat pituitary gland. In addition we have performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the potential role in this regard of lipocortin 1 (LC1), a protein shown previously not only to mediate aspects of the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative actions of the glucocorticoids but also to contribute to the regulatory actions of the steroids in the brain-neuroendocrine system. In vitro, the release of ir-PRL from rat anterior pituitary tissue initiated by submaximal concentrations of VIP (10 nM). TRH (10 nM) or the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (100 microM) was reduced significantly (p &lt; 0.01) by preincubation (2 h) of the tissue with dexamethasone (0.1 microM). By contrast, ir-PRL release evoked by a submaximal concentration of the L-Ca2+ channel opener BAY K8644 (10 microM) was unaffected by the steroid although readily antagonised (p &lt; 0.01) by nifedipine (1-100 microM). Exposure of the pituitary tissue to dexamethasone (0.1 microM) also caused a pronounced and highly significant increase in de novo protein synthesis, as assessed by the incorporation of 14C-lysine into the tissue (p &lt; 0.001). This response was reduced markedly by the inclusion of the RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin-D (0.5 micrograms/ml) or cycloheximide (1.0 micrograms/ml), in the incubation medium (p &lt; 0.001), both of which also effectively abrogated (p &lt; 0.01) the dexamethasone-induced inhibition of the release of ir-PRL evoked by TRH. VIP and forskolin. Lipocortin I was readily detectable by Western blotting in protein extracts of freshly excised anterior pituitary tissue: a small proportion of the protein was found to be attached to the outer surface of the cells where it was retained by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Exposure of the tissue in vitro to dexamethasone (0.1 microM) or corticosterone (0.1 microM) but not 17 beta-oestradiol (0.1 microM) caused a pronounced increase in the amount of LC1 attached to the outer surface of the cells and concomitant decrease in the LC1 content of the intracellular LC1 pool. Addition of an N-terminal LC1 fragment. LC11-188 (10 pg-10 ng/ml), to the incubation medium reduced significantly (p &lt; 0.01) the increases in ir-PRL release induced in vitro by VIP (10 nM) and forskolin (100 microM). By contrast, at all concentrations tested. LC11-188 (10 pg-10 ng/ml) failed to influence (p &lt; 0.05) the highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) ir-PRL response to TRH (10 nM). Similarly, the inhibitory actions of dexamethasone (0.1 microM) on the release of ir-PRL induced by VIP (10 nM) or forskolin (100 microM) but not by TRH (10 nM) were substantially reversed (p &lt; 0.01) by a specific monoclonal anti-LC1 antibody while an isotype-matched control antibody was without effect. In vivo, rats pretreated with either a polyclonal anti LC1 antiserum (anti-LC1 pAb, 1 ml/day s.c. for 2 days) or a corresponding volume of non-immune sheep serum (NSS) responded to stress (laparotomy under ether anaesthesia) with significant (p &lt; 0.05) increases in the serum ir-PRL concentration. In the NSS-treated group, the ir-PRL response to stress was effectively inhibited by dexamethasone (100 micrograms/kg i.p.) which had no effect on the pre-stress serum ir-PRL concentration. By contrast, in rats pretreated with anti-LC1 pAb dexamethasone failed to block the stress-induced release of ir-PRL. The results show clearly that the inhibitory actions of dexamethasone on PRL release are dependent on de novo protein synthesis and provide novel evidence for the involvement of both LC1-dependent and LC1-independent mechanisms.",

DEX caused 100% inhibition of cytotoxicity by LPS- and IFN gamma-activated macrophages whereas it caused only partial inhibition of NO production. Inhibition of macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity by DEX was not reversed by supplementation of rTNF alpha. The partial inhibition of NO production by DEX was due to partial inhibition of iNOS mRNA expression. Incubation of macrophages with DEX for up to 24 h prior to activation did not cause further inhibition of NO production. DEX failed to inhibit NO production if added 6 h after addition of LPS and IFN gamma. Addition of P815 cells after the onset of NO production resulted in partial restoration of cytotoxicity in DEX-treated macrophages. Incubation of P815 cells with spermine NONOate, a synthetic NO donor, resulted in P815 cell lysis, which was dose-dependent, had a lag phase of 3 h and was blocked by hemoglobin. DEX also inhibited spermine NONOate-mediated tumor cell lysis, indicating that DEX may have a protective effect on tumor targets. These results indicate that DEX inhibits macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity by decreasing NO production and by inhibiting the cytotoxic effects of NO on the target cells.",

After angioplasty alone, the restenosis process also involves thrombus formation and negative remodeling. Due to the pleiotropic mode of action exerted by glucocorticoids which include profound anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, direct inhibition on SMC proliferation and apoptosis, their potential in the prevention of restenosis has gained widespread interest. Over the last decade, preclinical and clinical data have not been able to conclusively document a robust therapeutic effect on restenosis after angioplasty or stent implantation. Only recently, preclinical data and limited observations in humans using drug eluting stents for local drug delivery have suggested beneficial effects of dexamethasone on neointimal proliferation. Randomized clinical trials using local drug delivery are expected to start in the near future.

In this study we systematically compared various natural and synthetic steroid hormones frequently used as therapeutic agents on their ability to mediate these three modes of action. Betamethasone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone and clobetasol turned out to be the best inducers of gene expression and apoptosis. All GCs including the antagonistic compound RU486 efficiently reduced NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation to comparable extents, suggesting that ligand-induced nuclear localization of the GR is sufficient for transrepression.

Both sulfated hyaluronic acid and dexamethasone are candidates for the functionalization of bone grafts, as they have been shown to enhance the differentiation of osteoblasts from bone marrow stromal cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Furthermore, studies combining different approaches to assess synergistic potentials are rare. In this study, we aim to gain insights into the mode of action of both sulfated hyaluronic acid and dexamethasone by a comprehensive analysis of the cellular fraction, released matrix vesicles, and the extracellular matrix, combining classical biochemical assays with mass spectrometry-based proteomics, supported by novel bioinformatical computations. We found elevated differentiation levels for both treatments, which were further enhanced by a combination of sulfated hyaluronic acid and dexamethasone. Single treatments revealed specific effects on osteogenic differentiation. Dexamethasone activates signalling pathways involved in the differentiation of osteoblasts, for example, CXC-motif chemokine receptor type 4 and mitogen-activated protein kinases. The effects of sulfated hyaluronic acid were predominantly linked to an alteration in the composition of the extracellular matrix, affecting the synthesis, secretion, and/or activity of fibrillary (fibronectin and thrombospondin-2) and nonfibrillary (transglutaminase-2, periostin, and lysyloxidase) extracellular matrix components, including proteases and their inhibitors (matrix metalloproteinase-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3). The effects were treatment specific, and less additive or contrary effects were found. Thus, we anticipate that the synergistic action of the treatment-specific effects is the key driver in elevated osteogenesis.",

Phosphorylation has been hypothesized as a means to control the assembly/disassembly of liquid-like RNA- and protein-rich intracellular bodies, or liquid organelles, that lack delimiting membranes. Here, we demonstrate that charge-mediated phase separation, or complex coacervation, of RNAs with cationic peptides can generate simple model liquid organelles capable of reversibly compartmentalizing biomolecules. Formation and dissolution of these liquid bodies was controlled by changes in peptide phosphorylation state using a kinase/phosphatase enzyme pair. The droplet-generating phase transition responded to modification of even a single serine residue. Electrostatic interactions between the short cationic peptides and the much longer polyanionic RNAs drove phase separation. Coacervates were also formed on silica beads, a primitive model for localization at specific intracellular sites.

The addition of PEG decreased both the amount of spermine required for phase separation and the coacervation temperature (T<sub>C</sub>). We interpret these effects on phase behavior as arising due to excluded volume and preferential interactions on both the secondary structure/condensation of spermine-associated polyU molecules and on the association of soluble polyU/spermine polyelectrolyte complexes to form coacervate droplets. Examination of coacervates formed in the presence of fluorescently-labeled PEG or Ficoll crowders indicated that Ficoll is accumulated while PEG is excluded from the coacervate phase, which provides further insight into the differences in phase behavior. Crowding agents impact distribution of a biomolecular solute: partitioning of a fluorescently-labeled U15 RNA oligomer into the polyU/spermine coacervates was increased approximately two-fold by 20 wt% Ficoll 70 kDa and by more than two orders of magnitude by 20 wt% PEG 8 kDa. The volume of the coacervate phase decreased in the presence of crowder relative to a dilute buffer solution.

Both mixtures (i.e., protamine/citrate and protamine/TPP) underwent coacervation in an aqueous solution, while a mixture of protamine and sodium chloride did not. Interestingly, the complex coacervation of protamine and multivalent anions showed upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior, and the coacervation of protamine and multivalent anions was reversible with solution temperature changes.

In this work, we incorporate silica nanoparticles forming a hybrid complex coacervate and investigate the resulting mechanical properties. An enhancement of the mechanical properties is observed below the PNIPAM lower critical solution temperature (LCST): this is due to the formation of PNIPAM-silica junctions, which, after setting, contribute to a moderate increase in the moduli and in the adhesive properties only when applying an ionic strength gradient. By contrast, when raising the temperature above the LCST, the mechanical properties are dominated by the association of PNIPAM chains and the nanofiller incorporation leads to an increased heterogeneity with the formation of fracture planes at the interface between areas of different concentrations of nanoparticles, promoting earlier failure of the network-an unexpected and noteworthy consequence of this hybrid system.",

Hemoglobin-containing coacervate vesicles have been prepared from gelatin A and the polyanionic carbohydrates acacia, pectin, or dextranstilfate. Hemoglobin seems to be anchored into the vesicle walls through interaction of its polyanion binding site with the negatively charged residues on the carbohydrates. Oxygen binding by the immobilized HbA is reversible and cooperative, with p50 values at 20 degrees C of 2.8, 6, and 24 mm Hg for the acacia- (pH 7.5), pectin- (pH 6.6), and dextransulfate-(pH 6.6) derived coacervates.

In this article, we use a combination of theory, experiment, and simulation to establish the physical principles governing sequence-driven control of electrostatic interactions. We predict how arbitrary sequences of charge give rise to drastic changes in electrostatic interactions and correspondingly phase behavior. We generalize a transfer matrix formalism that describes a phase separation phenomenon known as \"complex coacervation\" and provide a theoretical framework to predict the phase behavior of charge sequences. This work thus provides insights into both how charge sequence is used in biology and how it could be used to engineer properties of synthetic polymer systems.",

Complex coacervation covered the situation in which a mixture of two polymeric polyions with opposite charge separated into liquid dilute and concentrated phases, in the same solvent, with both phases, at equilibrium, containing both polyions. Voorn and Overbeek provided the first theoretical analysis of complex coacervation by applying Flory-Huggins polymer statistics to model the random mixing of the polyions and their counter ions in solution, assuming completely random mixing of the polyions in each phase, with the electrostatic free energy, \u0394G(elect), providing the driving force. However, experimentally complete randomness does not apply: polyion size, heterogeneity, chain stiffness and charge density (\u03c3) all affect the equilibrium phase separation and phase concentrations. Moreover, in pauci-disperse systems multiple phases are often observed. As an alternative, Veis and Aranyi proposed the formation of charge paired Symmetrical Aggregates (SA) as an initial step, followed by phase separation driven by the interaction parameter, \u03c7(23), combining both entropy and enthalpy factors other than the \u0394G(elect) electrostatic term. This two stage path to equilibrium phase separation allows for understanding and quantifying and modeling the diverse aggregates produced by interactions between polyampholyte molecules of different charge density, \u03c3, and intrinsic polyion structure.",

In the presence of a third liquid phase in the form of disperse oil droplets, the coacervate phase tends to wet the oil/water interface. This affinity has long been known and used for the formation of core/shell capsules. However, while encapsulation by simple or complex coacervation has been used empirically for decades, there is a lack of a thorough understanding of the three-phase wetting phenomena that control the formation of encapsulated, compound droplets and the role of the viscoelasticity of the biopolymers involved. In this contribution, we review and discuss the interplay of wetting phenomena and fluid viscoelasticity in coacervate/oil/water systems from the perspective of colloid chemistry and fluid dynamics, focusing on aspects of rheology, interfacial tension measurements at the coacervate/solvent interface, and on the formation and fragmentation of three-phase compound drops.",

This process results in a coacervate phase, which is a dense mix of the oppositely-charged components, and a supernatant phase, which is primarily devoid of these same species. First observed almost a century ago, coacervates have since found relevance in a wide range of applications; they are used in personal care and food products, cutting edge biotechnology, and as a motif for materials design and self-assembly. There has recently been a renaissance in our understanding of this important class of material phenomena, bringing the science of coacervation to the forefront of polymer and colloid science, biophysics, and industrial materials design. In this review, we describe the emergence of a number of these new research directions, specifically in the context of polymer-polymer complex coacervates, which are inspired by a number of key physical and chemical insights and driven by a diverse range of experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384692": "We address complex coacervation, the liquid-liquid phase separation of a solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chains into a polyelectrolyte rich complex coacervate phase and a dilute aqueous phase, based on the general premise of spontaneous formation of polycation-polyanion complexes even in the homogeneous phase. The complexes are treated as flexible chains made of dipolar segments and uniformly charged segments. Using a mean field theory that accounts for the entropy of all dissociated ions in the system, electrostatic interactions among dipolar and charged segments of complexes and uncomplexed polyelectrolytes, and polymer-solvent hydrophobicity, we have computed coacervate phase diagrams in terms of polyelectrolyte composition, added salt concentration, and temperature. For moderately hydrophobic polyelectrolytes in water at room temperature, neither hydrophobicity nor electrostatics alone is strong enough to cause phase separation, but their combined effect results in phase separation, arising from the enhancement of effective hydrophobicity by dipolar attractions. The computed phase diagrams capture key experimental observations including the suppression of complex coacervation due to increases in salt concentration, temperature, and polycation-polyanion composition asymmetry, and its promotion by increasing the chain length, and the preferential partitioning of salt into the polyelectrolyte dilute phase. We also provide new predictions such as the emergence of loops of instability with two critical points.",

Chronic administration of recombinant FGF21 or engineered variants improves metabolic health in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans; however, the rapid turnover of these molecules limits therapeutic utility. Here we show that the bispecific anti-FGFR1/KLB agonist antibody BFKB8488A induced marked weight loss in obese cynomolgus monkeys while elevating serum adiponectin and the adipose expression of FGFR1 target genes, demonstrating its action as an FGF21 mimetic. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study in overweight/obese human participants, subcutaneous BFKB8488A injection caused transient body weight reduction, sustained improvement in cardiometabolic parameters, and a trend toward reduction in preference for sweet taste and carbohydrate intake. These data suggest that specific activation of the FGFR1/KLB complex in humans can be used as therapy for obesity-related metabolic defects.",

Five cases of primary epidural EES are described, which presented with non-specific symptoms leading to a long diagnostic delay. The median age at diagnosis was 22 years (range 13-36 years). The median diagnostic delay was 3 months. All patients had one or more neurological deficits. All underwent surgical exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) alternating with ICE (ifosphamide, cisplatin and etoposide) for at least six cycles. The mean follow-up period is 21.2 months (range 11-32 months). Four of the five patients achieved a complete remission and are disease free at the time of writing this report. Two patients have a residual neurological deficit--both having presented with long history of neurological deficit. Primary spinal epidural EES should be suspected whenever young patients present with back pain and/or radicular pain, have abnormal neurology and an extradural mass is demonstrated on MRI. Surgical excision followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (50 Gy) and combination chemotherapy (VAC alternating with ICE) achieved local and systemic control in these patients. A greater number of patients and longer follow up are required to evolve a generally accepted treatment policy for this aggressive but potentially curable malignancy.",

We report here the results of multimodality therapy for this tumor. The 130 patients were less than 21 years of age; 70 (54%) were males. Primary tumor sites were on the trunk in 41 patients, an extremity in 34, the head/neck in 23, the retroperitoneum/pelvis in 21, and other sites in 11. One hundred fourteen patients had no metastases at diagnosis. In 21 patients, the tumor was completely resected; in 30, the localized or regional tumor was grossly resected, and in 63 patients, grossly visible sarcoma was left behind. Sixteen patients (12%) had distant metastases at diagnosis. All patients were given multiagent chemotherapy and most received irradiation (XRT); none were treated with bone marrow transplantation. One hundred seven patients (82%) achieved a complete response. At 10 years, 62%, 61%, and 77% of the patients were alive after treatment on IRS-I, IRS-II, or IRS-III therapeutic protocols, respectively, similar to figures obtained in all IRS patients. At last follow-up evaluation, 42 patients had died of progressive tumor and one of infection. Survival at 10 years was most likely for patients with tumor that arose in the head and neck, extremities, and trunk, and for those who underwent grossly complete tumor removal before initiation of chemotherapy. For patients with localized, gross residual tumor, adding doxorubicin (DOX) to the combination of vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC), and XRT did not significantly improve survival in 39 patients (62% alive at 10 years) compared with that of 24 patients treated with VAC and XRT without DOX (65% alive at 10 years, P = .93). This series indicated that EOE in children is similar to rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in its response to multimodal treatment. No benefit was apparent from the addition of DOX to VAC chemotherapy in patients with gross residual EOE.",

These lesions tended to be greater than 5 cm in diameter at diagnosis, invaded the spinal extradural space, and were of the extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma subtype in 55% (30 of 56) of the cases. Patients with tumors in clinical groups II, III, and IV were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) and vincristine-dactinomycin (VA) or VA plus cyclophosphamide (VAC) +/- doxorubicin. Clinical group I patients treated on IRS-II did not receive XRT, while those on IRS-I were randomized to receive VAC +/- XRT. Forty-four of the paraspinal patients (79%) achieved a complete response (CR) compared with 77% (1,260 of 1,632) for patients with disease in other sites. Twenty-seven patients (55%) subsequently relapsed (five local, three regional, four local and distant, and 14 distant). The proportion of patients surviving 5 years by clinical group (stage) from I to IV were 50%, 50%, 62%, and 27%, respectively. Paraspinal patients had somewhat poorer survival than patients with disease in other sites, both in IRS-I and IRS-II; the percentage of paraspinal patients surviving 5 years was 50% and 52% for IRS-I and IRS-II, respectively, whereas these percentages were 55% and 63% for patients with disease in other sites. Histology did not influence the CR rate, but unexpectedly, patients who had embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) had the poorest overall survival rate.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29541566": "Owing to its rarity, rhabdomyosarcoma of the head and neck (HNRMS) has seldom been discussed in the literature. As most of the data is based only on the retrospective experiences of tertiary healthcare centers, there are difficulties in formulating a standard treatment protocol. Moreover, the disease is poorly understood at its pathological, genetic, and molecular levels. For instance, 20% of all histological assessment is inaccurate; even an experienced pathologist can confuse rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and lymphoma. RMS can occur sporadically or in association with genetic syndromes associated with predisposition to other cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 (von Recklinghausen disease). Such associations have a potential role in future gene therapies but are yet to be fully confirmed. Currently, chemotherapies are ineffective in advanced or metastatic disease and there is lack of targeted chemotherapy or biological therapy against RMS. Also, reported uses of chemotherapy for RMS have not produced reasonable responses in all cases. Despite numerous molecular and biological studies during the past three decades, the chemotherapeutic regimen remains unchanged. This vincristine, actinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) regime, described in Kilman, et al. (1973) and Koop, et al. (1963), has achieved limited success in controlling the progression of RMS. Thus, the pathogenesis of RMS remains poorly understood despite extensive modern trials and more than 30 years of studies exploring the chemotherapeutic options. This suggests a need to explore surgical options for managing the disease. Surgery is the single most critical therapy for pediatric HNRMS. However, very few studies have explored the surgical management of pediatric HNRMS and there is no standard surgical protocol. The aim of this review is to explore and address such issues in the hope of maximizing the number of options available for young patients with HNRMS.",

After the induction chemotherapy consisting of alternating vincristine, adriablastin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) and etoposide, ifosfamide with mesna protection (IE), a local treatment modality was chosen based on tumor and patient characteristics. Twenty-five patients with a median age of 19 years were evaluated. Median follow-up was 26 months (range 4-58). Seventeen patients (68%) had died. In univariate analysis, factors predictive of shorter survival were the patients presenting with metastatic disease, with the primary tumor located at the pelvis, those who never achieved complete response to chemotherapy and those who had chemotherapy for &lt;12 months. Only a negative link with pelvic location was observed in multivariate analysis [risk ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-37.06; P = 0.0134].

Induction chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of 'VAC': vincristine (V), doxorubicin (A), cyclophosphamide (C) alternated with one cycle of 'VIAc': V, ifosfamide (I), actinomycin (Ac). After local treatment, patients received three more cycles of VAC, two of VIAc, three cycles of I plus etoposide (E) and two cycles with V, C and Ac. Local treatment was surgery in 53% of patients, surgery+radiotherapy in 25% and radiotherapy only in 22%. With a follow-up ranging between 4 and 10 years (mean: 7 years), 110 patients (70%) remained continuously event-free, 2 patients died of toxicity and 45 patients relapsed: 33 due to metastases and 12 due to local recurrence always associated with metastases. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 71.0 and 76.5% respectively. These results are significantly better that the ones achieved in our previous three studies in which a three-drug VAC regimen (REA-1), and 4-drug VACAc regimen (REA-2 and REN-1) was used, and in our most recent study (REN-2) which was based on a six-drug regimen as in the present study, but where I and Ac were used only after the local treatment. However, since REN-3 surgery was used in a significantly larger number of patients, we cannot say whether the better outcome of this study was due to the use of a six-drug regimen with an early delivery of ifosfamide and actinomycin, or to the wider use of surgery as local treatment or both.",

In November 1984, these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1) alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days 21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3) local radiotherapy (RT); and (4) maintenance chemotherapy with alternating IVA and VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) for up to 9 months.

Impact of gender on event-free survival (EFS), acute toxicity by course, switches between treatment arms and cumulative dose of alkylating agents was evaluated in multivariable models adjusted for age including terms to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect by gender. The analysis of the EFS was performed on the intention-to-treat population. EFS did not significantly differ between the 509 males and 347 females (p=0.33), but an interaction in terms of efficacy was suspected between treatment and gender (p=0.058): VAC was associated with poorer EFS than VAI in males, hazard ratio (HR) (VAC/VAI)=1.37 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-1.90], contrasting with HR=0.81 [95%CI, 0.53-1.24] in females. Severe toxicity was more frequent in females, whatever the toxicity type. Thirty patients switched from VAI to VAC (9/251 males, 4%, and 21/174 females, 12%) mostly due to renal toxicity, and three from VAC to VAI (2/258 males, 0.8%, and 1/173 females, 0.6%).

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim administered after chemotherapy in children with Ewing sarcoma. We performed a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma. Every patient received both types of G-CSF in different treatment courses of chemotherapy, which consisted of vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (VIDE); vincristine, actinomycin D, and ifosfamide (VAI); or vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC). A single injection of pegfilgrastim 100 microg/kg SC or a daily injection of filgrastim 5 to 10 microg/kg SC was administered 48 to 72 hours after the completion of chemotherapy. The following data were collected from the medical charts: proportion of chemotherapy courses with grade 4 neutropenia, duration of grade 4 neutropenia, proportion with severe neutropenia, duration of severe neutropenia, proportion with febrile neutropenia, duration of antibiotic treatment, duration of hospitalization, and percentage of patients receiving transfusion. Grade 4 neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count of &lt;500 x 10(9)/L; severe neutropenia was defined as a count of &lt;200 x 10(9)/L. Adverse events were collected from the medical charts. Twenty children were included (13 girls and 7 boys). The patients' median age was 12.8 years (range, 9-17 years) and median weight was 45.2 kg (range, 28-90 kg). A total of 178 chemotherapy courses (108 VIDE; 70 VAI or VAC) were administered and evaluated, including 134 courses with pegfilgrastim and 44 courses with filgrastim. Considering all types of chemotherapy combined, those courses in which pegfilgrastim was used were associated with a significantly lower incidence of severe neutropenia (0.21 vs 0.85; P = 0.03), a shorter duration of severe neutropenia (0.49 vs 2.36 days; P = 0.01), and a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment (1.07 vs 4.22 days; P = 0.03) compared with courses treated with filgrastim. No statistically significant differences were observed for the proportion and duration of grade 4 neutropenia, proportion of febrile neutropenia, duration of hospitalization, or red blood cell and platelet transfusions. Adverse effects were few and comparable between pegfilgrastim and filgrastim. In this retrospective chart review of children with Ewing sarcoma, using pegfilgrastim after chemotherapy courses was associated with significantly reduced frequency and shorter duration of severe neutropenia compared with those courses followed by filgrastim.

The incidence of ERMS in the uterine cervix rarely occurs at a very young age. With sufficient resources, management of this disease is not difficult. However, in limited resources settings, such as in Indonesia, the situation is more challenging. This case report aims to highlight the difficulties encountered in diagnosing and treating patients with sarcoma botryoides. CASE REPORT A 3-year-old female patient came the outpatient clinic of our hospital with a protruding mass from her vagina resembling a bunch of grapes which easily bled. She underwent surgery to remove the mass. After the procedure, she did not return to the hospital for the recommended adjuvant chemotherapy treatment due to limited funds. Three months later, she came to the outpatient clinic with the same complaint, despite smaller size. Due to limited resources, we only evaluated the metastasis using chest x-ray and did not perform intra-operative biopsy. In the second surgery, a wide excision with 1-2 cm margin was performed, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 series. We achieved a satisfactory outcome in this case, and 18 months after the surgery, the patient was still in remission. CONCLUSIONS Sarcoma botryoides is a rare malignancy. The effective treatment for sarcoma botryoides is wide excision with safe margin of 1-2 cm, followed by 6-12 cycles of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) regiment as an adjuvant chemotherapy. A family's understanding of the treatment plan is important to achieve desired outcomes. Even with limited resources, this malignancy can still be properly treated.",

A Cyc dose equivalent to Ifos was to be determined when comparable myelotoxicity was achieved. Patients with either rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated soft-tissue sarcoma and gross residual (clinical group III) disease were eligible for the VAC pilot. Feasibility and toxicity were evaluated in the VAC pilot at each Cyc level before escalating the dose. Starting at CYC 1.2 g/m2 dose escalation was planned at increments of 20-25% in cohorts of 8-10 patients until myelotoxicity at a severe or worse grade was seen in &gt; 90% of the patients. One hundred nineteen eligible patients were evaluated for toxicity and response at four Cyc levels: 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, and 2.2 g/m2. Eight of 87 (9%) evaluable at 2.2 g/m2 had a toxic death. Six of these were attributable to myelotoxicity. Patients age 1-3 years were most vulnerable. The overall complete response (CR) rate of 68% was poorly predicted by the weeks 8 and 20 CR rates of 20 and 40%, respectively. During the first year and overall, myelotoxicity at 2.2 g/m2'1 with VAC was comparable to Ifos 1.8 g/m2'5. Cyc was relatively more myelotoxic than Ifos in the second year of the VAC pilot. Based on actual amount of drug given, a standardized Ifos dose of 9.0 g/m2 was equivalent to 2.1 g/m2 of Cyc, giving an Ifos/Cyc ratio of 4.3. Myelotoxicity using 2.2 g Cyc/m2 in a single intravenous infusion was dose limiting in this VAC pilot without HGF. In the first year and overall, myelotoxicity is comparable to that with VAI using Ifos at 9.0 g/m2. An ongoing IRS-IV randomized trial of VAC and VAI should provide a comparison of the efficacy of Ifos and Cyc in children and adolescents with embryonal or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated soft-tissue sarcomas.",

Standard chemotherapy consisted of etoposide/ifosfamide (VP16/IFOS) cycles, alternating with vincristine/dactinomycin/cyclophosphamide (VAC) cycles. CsA was given at a median dose of 20 mg/kg with unaltered doses of the antineoplastic drugs. The analysis of toxicity was performed by comparing clinically significant toxicity events recorded during and after chemotherapy cycles with and without CsA. Toxicity-related hospital admissions occurred after 93% of VAC cycles with CsA compared to 40% of the cycles without CsA (P &lt; 0. 0001); 29% of VP16/IFOS cycles with CsA led to admissions vs. 12% with non-CsA cycles (P = 0.04). Infections or fever and neutropenia were the main reasons for these admissions. Thirty-seven percent of the VAC cycles with CsA were complicated by culture-proved sepsis, which did not occur in cycles without CsA (P &lt; 0.0001). Requirements for blood and platelet transfusions were greatly increased after VAC cycles with CsA compared to VAC cycles without CsA. The chemosensitizer CsA increases the systemic toxicity of VAC chemotherapy in patients with sarcomas. Future trials of chemotherapy with chemosensitizers will have to take into account a potential increase in systemic toxicity. Careful monitoring of chemotherapy-related toxicity becomes mandatory in such studies.",

The Intergroup Study was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and metastases. All patients received RT to the primary lesion, and the survival rate after 3 years was 65%. The most effective treatment regimen was VAC plus ADR; 74% of the patients were free of disease at 2 years. The lengths of disease-free status and survival of patients treated with VAC plus ADR or VAC plus RT did not differ. However, both regimens were significantly superior to treatment with VAC alone. The addition of ADR or bilateral pulmonary RT to VAC was highly advantageous to patients with nonpelvic primaries. Bone and lung were the major sites of distant relapse, but the addition of bilateral pulmonary RT showed no advantage over that of ADR in reducing the occurrence of lung metastases. These recent results should eliminate some of the pessimism that has accompanied a diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, although distant metastases continued to be a major reason for failure in the control of this tumor. Survival of these patients can be improved through well-controlled clinical trials designed to determine optimal adjuvant chemotherapy and treatment of the primary lesion.",

To detect how APOE \u03b54 affects CSF YKL-40 levels in cognitively normal (CN) states, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia, data from 35 CN subjects, 63 patients with MCI, and 11 patients with AD from a cross-sectional study in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were investigated. The results showed that CSF YKL-40 concentrations were increased in the AD dementia group than in the CN group. CSF YKL-40 levels were higher in APOE \u03b54 carriers than in noncarriers with MCI. No statistically significant difference was found in CSF YKL-40 levels between APOE \u03b54 carrier and noncarriers in AD and CN subjects. CSF YKL-40 concentrations were tightly related to CSF tau and p-tau concentrations in the MCI group. Analysis implied that APOE \u03b54 might affect CSF YKL-40 levels in MCI subjects, suggesting a crucial role of APOE \u03b54 in neuroinflammation in detecting individuals who might convert to AD from MCI and, thus, as an effective predictive factor.",

Neurodegenerative processes are caused by various etiological factors and differ in their clinical presentation. Neuroinflammation is widely discussed as both a cause and a consequence in the manifestation of these disorders. The interplay between the two entities is considered as a major contributor to the ongoing disease progression. An attentive search and implementation of new and reliable markers specific for the processes of inflammation and degeneration is still needed. YKL-40 is a secreted glycoprotein produced by activated glial cells during neuroinflammation. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), expressed mainly by neuronal cells, is a long-standing marker for neuronal damage. The aim of this review is to summarize, clarify, and evaluate the potential significance and relationship between YKL-40 and NSE as biomarkers in the monitoring and prognosis of a set of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. YKL-40 appears to be a more reliable biomarker in neurological diseases than NSE. The more prominent expression pattern of YKL-40 could be explained with the more obvious involvement of glial cells in pathological processes accompanying each neurodegenerative disease, whereas reduced NSE levels are likely related to low metabolic activity and increased death of neurons.",

A demonstrated lack of linkage to SILV, the strong candidate gene for silver, led to the initiation of a genome scan utilizing 2 pedigrees segregating for silver coat color. Linkage mapping defined a genomic region for SILVER as a 3.3-Mb region, (95.87-99.21 Mb) on chromosome D2, (peak logarithm of the odds = 10.5, = 0), which displays conserved synteny to a genomic interval between 118.58 and 121.85 Mb on chromosome 10 in the human genome. In the domestic cat, mutations at the SILVER locus suppress the development of pigment in the hair, but in contrast to other mammalian silver variants, there is an apparently greater influence on the production of pheomelanin than eumelanin pigment. The mapping of a novel locus for SILVER offers much promise in identifying a gene that may help elucidate aspects of pheomelanogenesis, a pathway that has been very elusive, and illustrates the promise of the cat genome project in increasing our understanding of basic biological processes of general relevance for mammals.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26634309": "Flavivirus infection causes host cell death by initiation of an unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is initiated following activation of three ER-membrane resident sensors, PERK, IRE1\u03b1 and ATF6, which are otherwise kept inactive through association with the ER-chaperone GRP78. Activation precedes cellular and molecular changes that act to restore homeostasis but might eventually initiate apoptosis. These changes involve influencing function of multiple genes by either transcriptional or post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Transcriptional control includes expression of transcription factor cascades, which influence cognate gene expression. Malat1 is a long non-coding RNA which is over-expressed in many human oncogenic tissues and regulates cell cycle and survival. In this report, for the first time we show activation of Malat1 following infection by two flaviviruses, both of which activate the UPR in host cells. The temporal kinetics of expression was restricted to later time points. Further, Malat1 was also activated by pharmacological inducer of UPR, to a similar degree. Using drugs that specifically inhibit or activate the PERK or IRE1\u03b1 sensors, we demonstrate that signalling through the PERK axis activates this expression, through a transcriptional mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an UPR pathway regulating the expression of an lncRNA.",

In view of the rapid sequence divergence of lncRNAs, present knowledge of stress trasncriptome is limited and fragmented. Several known stress-related lncRNAs, associated with specific nuclear speckled domains or nucleolus, provide structural base for sequestering diverse RNA-processing/regulatory proteins. Others have roles in transcriptional or translational inhibition during stress or in signaling pathways; functions of several other lncRNAs are not yet known. Most stress-related lncRNAs act primarily by modulating activity of the proteins to which they bind or by sequestering specific sets of proteins away from the active pool. A common emerging theme is that a given lncRNA targets one or more protein/s with key role/s in the cascade of events triggered by the stress and therefore has a widespread integrative effect. Since proteins associate with RNA through short sequence motifs, the overall base sequence of functionally similar ncRNAs is often not conserved except for specific motifs. The rapid evolvability of ncRNA sequences provides elegant modules for adaptability to changing environment as binding of one or the other protein to ncRNA can alter its structure and functions in distinct ways. Thus the stress-related lncRNAs act as hubs in the cellular networks to coordinate activities of the members within and between different networks to maintain cellular homeostasis for survival or to trigger cell death.",

Although this area of research is only in its infancy, this article focuses on several classes of regulatory ncRNA (i.e., miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA), while summarizing their activities in mammalian heat shock. We also present an updated model integrating the traditional heat shock response with the activities of regulatory ncRNA. Our model expands on the mechanisms for efficient execution of the stress response, while offering a more comprehensive summary of the major regulators and responders in heat shock signaling.

These over-estimates were drawn from the inherent developmental and stimuli-responsive complexity found in humans and other mammals, when compared to lower eukaryotic organisms. This left a conceptual void in many cellular networks, as a new class of functional molecules was necessary for \"fine-tuning\" the basic proteomic machinery. Transcriptomics analyses have determined that the vast majority of the genetic material is transcribed as noncoding RNA, suggesting that these molecules could provide the functional diversity initially sought from proteins. Indeed, as discussed in this review, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), the largest family of noncoding transcripts, have emerged as common regulators of many cellular stressors; including heat shock, metabolic deprivation and DNA damage. These stimuli, while divergent in nature, share some common stress-responsive pathways, notably inhibition of cell proliferation. This role intrinsically makes stress-responsive lncRNA regulators potential tumor suppressor or proto-oncogenic genes. As the list of functional RNA molecules continues to rapidly expand it is becoming increasingly clear that the significance and functionality of this family may someday rival that of proteins.

Here, we show that shutdown of rRNA synthesis in response to elevated temperature is brought about by mechanisms that target both the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription machinery and the epigenetic signature of the rDNA promoter. Upon heat shock, the basal transcription factor TIF-IA is inactivated by inhibition of CK2-dependent phosphorylations at Ser170/172. Attenuation of pre-rRNA synthesis in response to heat stress is accompanied by upregulation of PAPAS, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is transcribed in antisense orientation to pre-rRNA. PAPAS interacts with CHD4, the adenosine triphosphatase subunit of NuRD, leading to deacetylation of histones and movement of the promoter-bound nucleosome into a position that is refractory to transcription initiation. The results exemplify how stress-induced inactivation of TIF-IA and lncRNA-dependent changes of chromatin structure ensure repression of rRNA synthesis in response to thermo-stress.",

The present study was undertaken to further investigate the role of <i>NEAT1</i> in cellular stress response pathways. We show that <i>NEAT1</i> is a novel target gene of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and is up-regulated when the heat shock response pathway is activated by sulforaphane (SFN) or elevated temperature. HSF1 binds specifically to a newly identified conserved heat shock element in the <i>NEAT1</i> promoter. In line with this, SFN induced the formation of <i>NEAT1</i>-containing paraspeckles via an HSF1-dependent mechanism. HSF1 plays a key role in the cellular response to proteotoxic stress by promoting the expression of a series of genes, including those encoding molecular chaperones. We have found that the expression of HSP70, HSP90, and HSP27 is amplified and sustained during heat shock in <i>NEAT1</i>-depleted cells compared with control cells, indicating that <i>NEAT1</i> feeds back via an unknown mechanism to regulate HSF1 activity.

There is paucity of data on voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) among Southeast Asians, who exhibit a higher prevalence of CYP2C19-poor metabolisers compared with Caucasians and East Asians. Hence, there are concerns for higher risk of voriconazole accumulation and toxicity. We aim to determine the utility of voriconazole TDM through establishing: (1) proportion of patients achieving therapeutic troughs without dose adjustments; (2) characterisation of patients with sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic levels; (3) appropriate dose titrations/dose required for therapeutic troughs; (4) correlation between troughs and adverse events, treatment response/fungal breakthrough. A single-centre retrospective analysis of data from adults (\u226521 years old) with \u22651 voriconazole trough measured at Singapore General Hospital from 2015 to 2017 was performed. Thirty-two patients (45.7%) among 70 patients achieved therapeutic troughs (defined as 2.0-5.5 mg/L) without dose adjustments. Eleven patients (15.7%) experienced hepatotoxicity (troughs 0.5 to &gt;7.5 mg/L). Neurotoxicity occurred in three patients (4.3%) (troughs \u22656.7 mg/L) and all patients had symptom resolution upon dose reduction. Treatment failure of invasive fungal infection appeared less in patients with therapeutic troughs compared with sub-therapeutic troughs (11.4% vs. 14.2%). Two patients experienced treatment failure despite supra-therapeutic voriconazole troughs. TDM should be implemented due to significant unpredictability in dose exposure. TDM can reduce unnecessary switches to alternatives due to intolerability and rule in the possibility of resistant organisms in the event of treatment failure despite therapeutic troughs, alerting clinicians to switch to alternatives promptly.",

Conventional differential expression analysis methods (e.g. student's t-test, ANOVA) focus on assessing mean and variance of biomolecules in each biological group. On the other hand, network-based approaches take into account the interactions between biomolecules in choosing differentially expressed ones. These interactions are typically evaluated by correlation methods that tend to generate over-complicated networks due to many seemingly indirect associations. In this paper, we introduce a new R/Bioconductor package INDEED that allows users to construct a sparse network based on partial correlation, and to identify biomolecules that have significant changes both at individual expression and pairwise interaction levels. We applied INDEED for analysis of two omic datasets acquired in a cancer biomarker discovery study to help rank disease-associated biomolecules. We believe biomolecules selected by INDEED lead to improved sensitivity and specificity in detecting disease status compared to those selected by conventional statistical methods. Also, INDEED's framework is amenable to further expansion to integrate networks from multi-omic studies, thereby allowing selection of reliable disease-associated biomolecules or disease biomarkers.",

Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool; and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free, maintains the integrity of BEVs and ensures reproducibility through the use of automated liquid handlers. Post-separation BEVs are characterized using orthogonal biochemical endotoxin and Toll-like receptor-based reporter assays in combination with proteomics, electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to evaluate BEV quality, abundance, structure and molecular cargo. Separation and characterization of BEVs from body fluids can be done within 72 h, is compatible with EEV analysis and can be readily adopted by researchers experienced in basic molecular biology and extracellular vesicle analysis. We anticipate that this protocol will expand our knowledge on the biological heterogeneity, molecular cargo and function of BEVs in human body fluids and steer the development of laboratory research tools and clinical diagnostic kits.",

However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to <i>S. aureus</i> EVs by TLR2 signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K<sup>+</sup> efflux, leading to the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, pro-IL-18, and gasdermin-D by activated caspase-1 resulted in the cellular release of the mature cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and induction of pyroptosis. Consistent with this result, a dose-dependent cytokine response was detected in the extracellular fluids of mice challenged intraperitoneally with <i>S. aureus</i> EVs. Pore-forming toxins associated with <i>S. aureus</i> EVs were critical for NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation of human macrophages, but not for TLR2 signaling. In contrast, EV-associated lipoproteins not only mediated TLR2 signaling to initiate the priming step of NLRP3 activation but also modulated EV biogenesis and the toxin content of EVs, resulting in alterations in IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and caspase-1 activity. Collectively, our study describes mechanisms by which <i>S. aureus</i> EVs induce inflammasome activation and reveals an unexpected role of staphylococcal lipoproteins in EV biogenesis.

Recent studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from gram-negative periodontal pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 and 270 nm in diameter. Proteome analysis identified 28 proteins, including lipoproteins, autolysins, F. alocis complement inhibitor (FACIN), transporter-related proteins, metabolism-related proteins, and ribosomal proteins.

It faces the blastocoel cavity and later gives rise to the extraembryonic parietal and visceral endoderm. Here, we investigate a key step in primitive endoderm development, the acquisition of apico-basolateral polarity and epithelial characteristics by the non-epithelial inner cell mass cells. Embryoid bodies, formed from mouse embryonic stem cells, were used as a model to study this transition. The outer cells of these embryoid bodies were found to gradually acquire the hallmarks of polarised epithelial cells and express markers of primitive endoderm cell fate. Fgf receptor/Erk signalling is known to be required for specification of the primitive endoderm, but its role in polarisation of this tissue is less well understood. To investigate the function of this pathway in the primitive endoderm, embryoid bodies were cultured in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor of Mek. This inhibitor caused a loss of expression of markers of primitive endoderm cell fate and maintenance of the pluripotency marker Nanog. In addition, a mislocalisation of apico-basolateral markers and disruption of the epithelial barrier, which normally blocks free diffusion across the epithelial cell layer, occurred. Two inhibitors of the Fgf receptor elicited similar phenotypes, suggesting that Fgf receptor signalling promotes Erk-mediated polarisation. This data shows that primitive endoderm cells of the outer layer of embryoid bodies gradually polarise, and formation of a polarised primitive endoderm layer requires the Fgf receptor/Erk signalling pathway.",

Precisely how EPI and PrE cell fate commitment occurs is not entirely clear; however, previous studies in mice have implicated FGF/ERK signaling in this process. Here, we investigated the phenotype resulting from zygotic and maternal/zygotic inactivation of Fgf4. Fgf4 heterozygous blastocysts exhibited increased numbers of NANOG-positive EPI cells and reduced numbers of GATA6-positive PrE cells, suggesting that FGF signaling is tightly regulated to ensure specification of the appropriate numbers of cells for each lineage. Although the size of the ICM was unaffected in Fgf4 null mutant embryos, it entirely lacked a PrE layer and exclusively comprised NANOG-expressing cells at the time of implantation. An initial period of widespread EPI and PrE marker co-expression was however established even in the absence of FGF4. Thus, Fgf4 mutant embryos initiated the PrE program but exhibited defects in its restriction phase, when lineage bias is acquired. Consistent with this, XEN cells could be derived from Fgf4 mutant embryos in which PrE had been restored and these cells appeared indistinguishable from wild-type cells. Sustained exogenous FGF failed to rescue the mutant phenotype. Instead, depending on concentration, we noted no effect or conversion of all ICM cells to GATA6-positive PrE. We propose that heterogeneities in the availability of FGF produce the salt-and-pepper distribution of lineage-biased cells.",

Expression of the Egam1 transcript and its encoded protein was detectable in differentiating mouse ES cells, while it was almost undetectable in undifferentiated cells. In the present study, in order to clarify the effect of forced expression of EGAM1 on the differentiation of mouse ES cells in vitro, transfectants expressing exogenous EGAM1 were generated. Egam1 transfectants promoted differentiation into cell types expressing Gata6, Gata4, Afp, or Plat, genes associated with emergence of the extra-embryonic endoderm lineages. On the other hand, Egam1 transfectants inhibited the expression of specific genes for the embryonic lineages, including Fgf5 (epiblast) and T (mesoderm), in addition to Cdx2, a specific gene for the extra-embryonic trophectoderm lineages. Changes in the percentage of cells recognizing by antibodies against specific marker proteins closely correlated with the expression patterns of their transcripts.

In this work, we isolated Lrp2 as a novel PrE precursor (pre-PrE) marker by using a microarray strategy that combines a transcriptome analysis of three stem cell lines and early embryos. A detailed expression analysis shows that Lrp2 expression is induced in late E3.5 embryos indicating that pre-PrE cells are progressively maturing prior to polarization into an epithelium. Furthermore, the subcellular location of Lrp2, Disabled-2 (Dab2) and Collagen-IV shows that the epithelial structure is acquired in individual cells through successive steps.",

Whereas the mechanisms of TE specification have been extensively studied, segregation of PrE and the pluripotent epiblast (EPI) has received comparatively little attention. A current model of PrE specification suggests PrE precursors exhibit an apparently random distribution within the inner cell mass of the early blastocyst and then segregate to their final position lining the cavity by the late blastocyst. We have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfralpha) as an early-expressed protein that is also a marker of the later PrE lineage. By combining live imaging of embryos expressing a histone H2B-GFP fusion protein reporter under the control of Pdgfra regulatory elements with the analysis of lineage-specific markers, we investigated the events leading to PrE and EPI lineage segregation in the mouse, and correlated our findings using an embryo staging system based on total cell number. Before blastocyst formation, lineage-specific factors are expressed in an overlapping manner. Subsequently, a gradual progression towards a mutually exclusive expression of PrE- and EPI-specific markers occurs.

These processes can be recapitulated in vitro using F9 teratocarcinoma cells, which differentiate into primitive endoderm when treated with retinoic acid (RA) and into parietal endoderm with subsequent treatment with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP). Our previous work on how primitive endoderm develops revealed that the Wnt6 gene is upregulated by RA, leading to the activation of the canonical WNT-\u03b2-catenin pathway. The mechanism by which Wnt6 is regulated was not determined, but in silico analysis of the human WNT6 promoter region had suggested that the GATA6 and FOXA2 transcription factors might be involved [1]. Subsequent analysis determined that both Gata6 and Foxa2 mRNA are upregulated in F9 cells treated with RA or RA and db-cAMP. More specifically, overexpression of Gata6 or Foxa2 alone induced molecular and morphological markers of primitive endoderm, which occurred concomitantly with the upregulation of the Wnt6 gene. Gata6- or Foxa2-overexpressing cells were also found to have increased levels in T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription, and when these cells were treated with db-cAMP, they developed into parietal endoderm. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that GATA6 and FOXA2 were bound to the Wnt6 promoter, and overexpression studies showed that these transcription factors were sufficient to switch on the gene expression of a Wnt6 reporter construct. Together, these results provide evidence for the direct regulation of Wnt6 that leads to the activation of the canonical WNT-\u03b2-catenin pathway and subsequent induction of primitive extraembryonic endoderm.",

We analyzed the relationship between Grb2 and GATA6 in the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells to primitive endoderm in embryoid body models. Upon transfection with GATA6 expression vector, Grb2-null ES cells underwent endoderm differentiation as indicated by the expression of the extraembryonic endoderm markers Dab2 and GATA4. Transfection of GATA4 expression vector also had the same differentiation potency. When GATA6- or GATA4-transfected Grb2-null ES cells were allowed to aggregate, fragments of an endoderm layer formed on the surface of the spheroids. The results suggest that GATA6 is downstream of Grb2 in the inductive signaling pathway and the expression of GATA6 is sufficient to compensate for the defects caused by Grb2 deficiency in the development of the primitive and extraembryonic endoderm.",

GATA4 and GATA6 are the key transcription factors in the formation of extraembryonic endoderms, but their specific contribution to the derivation of each endoderm lineage needs clarification. We further analyzed the dynamic expression and mutant phenotypes of GATA6 in early mouse embryos. GATA6 and GATA4 are both expressed in primitive endoderm cells initially. At embryonic day (E) 5.0, parietal endoderm cells continue to express both GATA4 and GATA6; however, visceral endoderm cells express GATA4 but exhibit a reduced expression of GATA6. By and after E5.5, visceral endoderm cells no longer express GATA6. We also found that GATA6 null embryos did not form a morphologically recognizable primitive endoderm layer, and subsequently failed to form visceral and parietal endoderms. Thus, the current study establishes that GATA6 is essential for the formation of primitive endoderm, at a much earlier stage then previously recognized, and expression of GATA6 discriminates parietal endoderm from visceral endoderm lineages.",

We find that Gata6 mutants exhibit a complete absence of PrE and demonstrate that GATA6 levels regulate the timing and speed of lineage commitment within the ICM. Furthermore, we show that GATA6 is necessary for PrE specification by FGF signaling and propose a model where interactions between NANOG, GATA6, and the FGF/ERK pathway determine ICM cell fate.

PrE formation depends on Nanog by a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. To decipher early cell- and non-cell-autonomous effects, we performed a mosaic knockdown of Nanog and found that this is sufficient to induce a PrE fate cell autonomously. Strikingly, in Nanog null embryos, Gata6 expression is maintained, showing that initiation of the PrE program is Nanog independent. Treatment of Nanog null embryos with pharmacological inhibitors revealed that RTK dependency of Gata6 expression is initially direct but later indirect via Nanog repression. Moreover, we found that subsequent expression of Sox17 and Gata4--later markers of the PrE--depends on the presence of Fgf4 produced by Nanog-expressing cells.

A reduction in FGFR2 mRNA did not affect preimplantation development or the frequency of apoptotic blastomeres, but did enhanced proliferation of the inner cell mass in blastocysts (P &lt; 0.05)-which differs from the phenotype reported for bovine embryos using a pharmacological approach (treatment with the pan-FGFR blocker PD173074), but agrees with previous results obtained using mouse embryos. Moreover, the expression of an epiblast marker gene, NANOG, and a primitive endoderm marker gene, GATA6, remained unchanged, whereas the expression of another primitive endoderm marker gene, HNF4A, was significantly reduced in FGFR2-KD embryos.

Here, we further explore the role of Oct4 in blastocyst formation and specification of epiblast versus primitive endoderm lineages using conditional genetic deletion. Experiments involving mouse embryos deficient for both maternal and zygotic Oct4 suggest that it is dispensable for zygote formation, early cleavage and activation of Nanog expression. Nanog protein is significantly elevated in the presumptive inner cell mass of Oct4 null embryos, suggesting an unexpected role for Oct4 in attenuating the level of Nanog, which might be significant for priming differentiation during epiblast maturation. Induced deletion of Oct4 during the morula to blastocyst transition disrupts the ability of inner cell mass cells to adopt lineage-specific identity and acquire the molecular profile characteristic of either epiblast or primitive endoderm. Sox17, a marker of primitive endoderm, is not detected following prolonged culture of such embryos, but can be rescued by provision of exogenous FGF4. Interestingly, functional primitive endoderm can be rescued in Oct4-deficient embryos in embryonic stem cell complementation assays, but only if the host embryos are at the pre-blastocyst stage. We conclude that cell fate decisions within the inner cell mass are dependent upon Oct4 and that Oct4 is not cell-autonomously required for the differentiation of primitive endoderm derivatives, as long as an appropriate developmental environment is established.",

Pharmacogenetic studies have revealed that abacavir HSRs are highly associated with the major histocompatibility complex class I. Large studies established the effectiveness of prospective HLA-B*57:01 screening to prevent HSRs to abacavir. Accordingly to these results the abacavir label has been modified: the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA recommend/suggested that the administration of abacavir must be preceded by a specific genotyping test. The HLA locus is extremely polymorphic, exhibiting many closely related alleles, making it difficult to discriminate HLA-B*57:01 from other related alleles, and a number of different molecular techniques have been developed recently to detect the presence of HLA-B*57:01.

Vocimagene amiretrorepvec (Toca 511) is a retroviral replicating vector encoding cytosine deaminase, which converts extended release 5-fluorocytosine (Toca FC) into the anticancer agent, 5-fluorouracil. According to preclinical studies, this therapy kills cancer cells and immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, leading to T-cell-mediated antitumor immune activity. Therefore, we sought to elucidate this immune-related mechanism of action in humans, and to investigate potential molecular and immunologic indicators of clinical benefit from therapy. In a phase I clinical trial (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01470794\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT01470794</a>), patients with recurrent HGG treated with Toca 511 and Toca FC showed improved survival relative to historical controls, and some had durable complete responses to therapy. As a part of this trial, we performed whole-exome DNA sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and multiplex digital ELISA measurements on tumor and blood samples. Genetic analyses suggest mutations, copy-number variations, and neoantigens are linked to survival. Quantities of tumor immune infiltrates estimated by transcript abundance may potentially predict clinical outcomes. Peak values of cytokines in peripheral blood samples collected during and after therapy could indicate response. These results support an immune-related mechanism of action for Toca 511 and Toca FC, and suggest that molecular and immunologic signatures are related to clinical benefit from treatment.",

A randomized, open-label phase 2/3 trial (TOCA 5) in 58 centers in the US, Canada, Israel, and South Korea, comparing posttumor resection treatment with Toca 511 followed by Toca FC vs a defined single choice of approved (SOC) therapies was conducted from November 30, 2015, to December 20, 2019. Patients received tumor resection for first or second recurrence of glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Toca 511/FC (n = 201) or SOC control (n = 202). For the Toca 511/FC group, patients received Toca 511 injected into the resection cavity wall at the time of surgery, followed by cycles of oral Toca FC 6 weeks after surgery. For the SOC control group, patients received investigators' choice of single therapy: lomustine, temozolomide, or bevacizumab.

In the present study, we examined the changes in the head proteome of nurse honeybees exposed to individual and combined pesticides (the fungicide pyraclostrobin and the insecticide fipronil) at field-relevant doses (850 and 2.5 ppb, respectively). The head proteomes of bees exposed to pesticides were compared with those of bees that were not exposed, and proteins with differences in expression were identified by mass spectrometry. The exposure of nurse bees to pesticides reduced the expression of four of the major royal jelly proteins (MRJP1, MRJP2, MRJP4, and MRJP5) and also several proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism and energy synthesis, the antioxidant system, detoxification, biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, transcription and translation, protein folding and binding, olfaction, and learning and memory. Overall, when pyraclostrobin and fipronil were combined, the changes in protein expression were exacerbated. Our results demonstrate that vital proteins and metabolic processes are impaired in nurse honeybees exposed to pesticides in doses close to those experienced by these insects in the field, increasing their susceptibility to stressors and affecting the nutrition and maintenance of both managed and natural colonies.",

The first MRJP was identified in royal jelly, a secretion of the bees' hypopharyngeal glands that is used by young worker bees, called nurses, to feed developing larvae. Thus, MRJPs are frequently assumed to mainly have functions for developing bee larvae and to be expressed in the food glands of nurse bees. In-depth knowledge on caste- and age-specific role and abundance of MRJPs is missing. We here show, using combined quantitative real-time PCR with quantitative mass spectrometry, that expression and protein amount of <i>mrjp1-5</i> and <i>mrjp7</i> show an age-dependent pattern in worker's hypopharyngeal glands as well as in brains, albeit lower relative abundance in brains than in glands. Expression increases after hatching until the nurse bee period and is followed by a decrease in older workers that forage for plant products. <i>Mrjp6</i> expression deviates considerably from the expression profiles of the other <i>mrjps</i>, does not significantly vary in the brain, and shows its highest expression in the hypopharyngeal glands during the forager period. Furthermore, it is the only <i>mrjp</i> of which transcript abundance does not correlate with protein amount. <i>Mrjp8</i> and <i>mrjp9</i> show, compared to the other <i>mrjps,</i> a very low expression in both tissues. Albeit <i>mrjp8</i> mRNA was detected via qPCR, the protein was not quantified in any of the tissues. Due to the occurrence of MRJP8 and MRJP9 in other body parts of the bees, for example, the venom gland, they might not have a hypopharyngeal gland- or brain-specific function but rather functions in other tissues.

We determined the expression of mrjp1-9 among the honeybee worker caste (nurses, foragers) and the sexuals (queens (unmated, mated) and drones) in various body parts (head, thorax, abdomen). Specific mrjp expression was not only found in brood rearing nurse bees, but also in foragers and the sexuals. The expression of mrjp1 to 7 is characteristic for the heads of worker bees, with an elevated expression of mrjp1-4 and 7 in nurse bees compared to foragers. Mrjp5 and 6 were higher in foragers compared to nurses suggesting functions in addition to those of brood food proteins. Furthermore, the expression of mrjp9 was high in the heads, thoraces and abdomen of almost all female bees, suggesting a function irrespective of body section.

All bands visible in the SDS-PAGE profile of each type of honey were eluted, digested and identified by mass spectrometry in a LTQ-XL instrument.

First, two attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks models are used to extract entity relation and entity function, respectively. Then entity relation and their functions are combined into a BEL statement. In order to boost the overall performance, a strategy of threshold filtering is applied to improve the precision of identified entity functions.

The pathway is indispensable for the development of secretory cells by facilitating protein folding and enhancing secretory capacity. In the immune system, it is known to function in dendritic cells, plasma cells, and eosinophil development and differentiation, while its role in T helper cell is unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway in regulating activation and differentiation of type-2 T helper cell (Th2), a major T helper cell type involved in allergy, asthma, helminth infection, pregnancy, and tumor immunosuppression. We perturbed the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway and interrogated its role in Th2 cell differentiation. We performed genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of differential gene expression to reveal IRE1a-XBP1 pathway-regulated genes and predict their biological role. To identify direct target genes of XBP1 and define XBP1's regulatory network, we performed XBP1 ChIPmentation (ChIP-seq). We validated our predictions by flow cytometry, ELISA, and qPCR. We also used a fluorescent ubiquitin cell cycle indicator mouse to demonstrate the role of XBP1 in the cell cycle. We show that Th2 lymphocytes induce the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway during in vitro and in vivo activation. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of differential gene expression by perturbing the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway reveals XBP1-controlled genes and biological pathways. Performing XBP1 ChIPmentation (ChIP-seq) and integrating with transcriptomic data, we identify XBP1-controlled direct target genes and its transcriptional regulatory network. We observed that the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway controls cytokine secretion and the expression of two Th2 signature cytokines, IL13 and IL5. We also discovered that the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway facilitates activation-dependent Th2 cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression through S and G2/M phase. We confirm and detail the critical role of the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway during Th2 lymphocyte activation in regulating cytokine expression, secretion, and cell proliferation. Our high-quality genome-wide XBP1 ChIP and gene expression data provide a rich resource for investigating XBP1-regulated genes.

These medications have common dermatological side effects, particularly papulopustular (PPL) lesions. The management of the diagnosis and treatment processes for such side effects may facilitate the continuation of chemotherapy and enhance the patient's quality of life. The objective of this study is to report the cutaneous side effects of EGFR inhibitors and to share treatment methods for such side effects. In this prospective study, 59 patients using EGFR due to breast and colorectal carcinoma at the oncology unit of Haseki Training and Research Hospital were assessed. The patients for whom EGFR was initiated were examined at the beginning of the treatment at weeks 1 and 2, their demographic characteristics were recorded, and the patients who developed a skin rash were followed up from the onset of the lesion. The PPL side effects that developed in the patients and other dermatological findings were recorded. The PPL side effects were graded, and the treatment plans were reported. The study was conducted between February 2016 and February 2018 under the approval of the local ethical committee. The mean age of the 59 patients (47 females, 12 males) taking EGFR inhibitors was 52.4 \u00b1 12.0 (range: 29-84). Forty-five patients had early stage and 14 patients had advanced stage carcinoma. Fourteen patients had colorectal carcinoma, three patients had renal cancer, and 42 patients had breast cancer. Forty-two patients were using trastuzumab (single therapy in 29 patients and combined therapy in 13 patients), five patients were using cetuximab, three patients were using sunitinib, eight patients were using panitumumab, and six patients were using pertuzumab. In 22 patients, PPL side effects were observed in the skin; it was G1 in 19 patients and G2 in three patients. In seven patients who developed acneiform side effects, systemic doxycycline was used, and in others, topical tetracycline and clindamycin were used. Except for one patient using trastuzumab, all patients has lesions on the face, upper trunk, and back. One patient exhibited an atypical rash, which was diagnosed as a granulomatous follicular reaction. Xerosis was present in two cases, and paronychia, pyogenic granuloma, trichomegaly, and madarosis were observed in one patient each. The patients who developed an acneiform rash were treated with topical and systemic antibiotics, light keratolytics, and emollients. The skin side effects of all patients were mild to moderate, and all patients completed the chemotherapy process. An acneiform skin rash and other dermatological side effects are common with EGFR inhibitors. To treat these side effects, emollients, topical steroids, and local, systemic antibiotics are recommended. Clindamycin may be preferred as a topical treatment, and doxycycline may be preferred as a systematic treatment.",

Cholesterol acceptors, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), take up cholesterol and phospholipids effluxed from foam cells into the circulation. Due to the high abundance of cholesterol in foam cells, most previous studies focused on apoA-I/HDL-mediated free cholesterol (FC) transport. However, recent lipidomics of human atherosclerotic plaques also identified that oxidized sterols (oxysterols) and non-sterol lipid species accumulate as atherogenesis progresses. While it is known that these lipids regulate expression of pro-inflammatory genes linked to plaque instability, how cholesterol acceptors impact the foam cell lipidome, particularly oxysterols and non-sterol lipids, remains unexplored. Using lipidomics analyses, we found cholesterol acceptors remodel foam cell lipidomes. Lipid subclass analyses revealed various oxysterols, sphingomyelins, and ceramides, species uniquely enriched in human plaques were significantly reduced by cholesterol acceptors, especially by apoA-I. These results indicate that the function of lipid-poor apoA-I is not limited to the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids but suggest that apoA-I serves as a major regulator of the foam cell lipidome and might play an important role in reducing multiple lipid species involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

The process is characterized by complex vascular remodeling processes that require the actions of numerous proteins. The composition of atherosclerotic plaque is increasingly recognized as a major factor governing the occurrence of cardiovascular or neurological symptoms. To gain deeper insights into the composition of atherosclerotic plaques, we created quantitative proteome profiles of advanced plaque tissues of six male patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for stroke prevention. Using a quantitative, data-independent proteome approach, we identified 4181 proteins with an average protein coverage of 45%. An analysis of the quantitative composition of the tissue revealed key players of vascular remodeling processes. Moreover, compared with proximal arterial tissue, 20 proteins in mature plaques were enriched, whereas 52 proteins were found in lower quantities. Among the proteins with increased abundance were prominent extracellular matrix proteins such as biglycan and lumican, whereas cytoskeletal markers for contractile smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were decreased. Taken together, this study provides the most comprehensive quantitative assessment of mature human plaque tissue to date, which indicates a central role of SMCs in the structure of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.",

Seven proteins (p &lt; 0.05) that have been previously linked with atherosclerotic phenotypes were differentially abundant. Fibulin 1 proteoform C (FBLN1C), Beta-ala-his-dipeptidase (CNDP1), Cadherin-13 (CDH13), Gelsolin (GSN) and 72 kDa type IV collagenase (MMP2) were less abundant in cases, whereas Apolipoproteins C-III (APOC3) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) were more abundant. Using machine learning analysis, a biomarker panel of FBLN1C, APOE and CDH13 was identified, which classified cases from controls with an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.79. Furthermore, using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) the decreased abundance of FBLN1C was verified. In relation to previous associations of FBLN1C with atherosclerotic lesions, the observation could reflect its involvement in the initiation of the plaque formation, or represent a particular risk phenotype.",

The number of genes identified as being responsible for DEEs has been increasing rapidly. However, despite a comprehensive molecular analysis, a molecular diagnosis can only be established in 50% of cases. The aim of this project is to use whole exome sequencing (WES) to determine the molecular etiology of DEEs in undiagnosed patients with a pedigree suggestive of an autosomal recessive single gene disease. Three DEE families, having either consanguineous parents of an affected individual and/or having more than one affected offspring, were enrolled in the project. Prior to this project, the families had been evaluated using a next-generation sequencing panel including 16 DEE genes in a previous study; however, no molecular diagnosis could be established. In five cases from the three selected DEEs families in our study, the genetic etiology was investigated using WES. All patients in the study group had infantile onset epileptic seizures; however, semiologies varied. All patients presented with severe developmental delay. WES revealed biallelic disease causing mutations in DENDD5A, GRN, and TBCD genes in family 1, family 2, and family 3, respectively. In each family, the identified variants associated with the disease were segregated. Reverse phenotyping supported the molecular analysis.

We sought to characterize the level and pattern of development in children with SCN2A variants, and to address the sensitivity of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) in measuring changes over time in children with SCN2A-DEEs. Clinical histories for participants with pathogenic SCN2A variants in the Simons SearchLight project were analyzed for descriptive purposes. VABS scores obtained at study entry and yearly thereafter were analyzed for floor and ceiling effects, change with age, and association with epilepsy through use of regression and longitudinal regression methods. Sixty-four participants (50 with epilepsy, 30 [47%] female, median age 49 months, interquartile range [IQR] 28 to 101) were included. Histories of birth complications (N = 34, 54%), neonatal neurological signs (N = 45, 74%), and other neurological symptoms (N = 31, 48%) were common and similar in epilepsy and nonepilepsy subgroups. Mean standardized VABS scores (Composite 53.5; Motor, 55.8, Communication, 54.1, Socialization, 59.4, and Daily living skills, 55.1) reflected performance ~3 standard deviations below the normative test average. In longitudinal regression analyses, standardized scores decreased between 1.3 and 2.8 points per year, suggesting regression of abilities. Raw score analyses, however, revealed several subdomains with substantial floor effects (eg, community use); other raw scores increased with increasing age. Participants with epilepsy scored 0.6 to 1 SD lower than those without epilepsy (all P's &lt; .05). The VABS, as standardly administered, has shortcomings for addressing growth or regression in individuals with SCN2A-DEEs. Some subdomain raw scores reflected substantial floor effects. Raw scores increased so slowly over time that standardized scores declined. Alternative measures sensitive to incremental meaningful change are required if outcomes such as adaptive behavior are to be primary outcomes in short-term clinical trials.",

Because DEEs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, next-generation sequencing, especially exome sequencing (ES), is becoming a first-tier strategy to identify the molecular etiologies of these disorders. We combined ES analysis and international data sharing. We identified 11 unrelated individuals with DEE and de novo heterozygous truncating variants in the interferon regulatory factor 2-binding protein-like gene (IRF2BPL). The 11 individuals allowed for delineation of a consistent neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mostly normal initial psychomotor development followed by severe global neurological regression and epilepsy with nonspecific electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities and variable central nervous system (CNS) anomalies. IRF2BPL, also known as enhanced at puberty protein 1 (EAP1), encodes a transcriptional regulator containing a C-terminal RING-finger domain common to E3 ubiquitin ligases. This domain is required for its repressive and transactivating transcriptional properties. The variants identified are expected to encode a protein lacking the C-terminal RING-finger domain.

Mutant cDNAs were expressed in HEK293 cells, and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were conducted to test the impacts on Ca<sub>V</sub> 2.1 channel function. Channel localization and structure were assessed with immunofluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional (3D) modeling. We find that the G230V and I1357S mutations result in loss-of-function effects with reduced whole-cell current densities and decreased channel expression at the cell membrane. By contrast, the A713T and V1396M variants resulted in gain-of-function effects with increased whole-cell currents and facilitated current activation (hyperpolarized shift). The A713T variant also resulted in slower current decay. 3D modeling predicts conformational changes favoring channel opening for A713T and V1396M. Our findings suggest that both gain-of-function and loss-of-function CACNA1A mutations are associated with similarly severe DEEs and that functional validation is required to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and to guide therapies.",

We focused our attention on de novo mutations (DNMs) and identified candidate genes containing such variants. We sought to identify additional subjects with DNMs in these genes by performing targeted sequencing in another series of individuals with DEE and by mining various sequencing datasets. We also performed meta-analyses to document enrichment of DNMs in candidate genes by leveraging our WGS dataset with those of several DEE and ID series. By combining these strategies, we were able to provide a causal link between DEE and the following genes: NTRK2, GABRB2, CLTC, DHDDS, NUS1, RAB11A, GABBR2, and SNAP25. Overall, we established a molecular diagnosis in 63/197 (32%) individuals in our WGS series.

DEEs vs other epilepsies had more pharmacoresistance (71% vs 18%), intellectual disability (84% vs 11%), and mortality (21% vs &lt;1%; all P &lt; 0.001). During follow-up, the form of epilepsy evolved in 33 children. WS/IS was the most common initial diagnosis (N = 23) and in 5 children WS/IS evolved later. LGS was diagnosed initially in 4 children (1 later revised) and in 22 by the end of follow-up, including 7 evolving from WS/IS and 12 from nonsyndromic generalized, focal, or undetermined epilepsies. Evolution to LGS took a median of 1.9 years. LGS developed in 13% of infants, including 9% of those who did not present initially with WS/IS. DEEs account for disproportionate amounts of pharmacoresistance, disability, and early mortality. LGS often has a window between initial presentation and full expression. LGS should become targeted for early detection and prevention.",

Recent discoveries have greatly expanded the repertoire of genes that are mutated in epileptic encephalopathies and DEE, often in a de novo fashion, but in many patients, the disease remains molecularly uncharacterized. Here, we describe a new form of DEE in patients with likely deleterious biallelic variants in PTPN23. The phenotype is characterized by early onset drug-resistant epilepsy, severe and global developmental delay, microcephaly, and sometimes premature death. PTPN23 encodes a tyrosine phosphatase with strong brain expression, and its knockout in mouse is embryonically lethal. Structural modeling supports a deleterious effect of the identified alleles. Our data suggest that PTPN23 mutations cause a rare severe form of autosomal-recessive DEE in humans, a finding that requires confirmation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427099": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by epilepsy with comorbid intellectual disability. Recently, two de novo heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding TRPM3, a calcium permeable ion channel, were identified as the cause of DEE in eight probands, but the functional consequences of the mutations remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that both mutations (V990M and P1090Q) have distinct effects on TRPM3 gating, including increased basal activity, higher sensitivity to stimulation by the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and heat, and altered response to ligand modulation. Most strikingly, the V990M mutation affected the gating of the non-canonical pore of TRPM3, resulting in large inward cation currents via the voltage sensor domain in response to PS stimulation. Taken together, these data indicate that the two DEE mutations in TRPM3 result in a profound gain of channel function, which may lie at the basis of epileptic activity and neurodevelopmental symptoms in the patients."
