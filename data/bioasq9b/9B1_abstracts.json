Here we describe six unrelated individuals with de novo missense variants affecting the ATPase domain of VPS4A, a critical enzyme regulating ESCRT function. Probands had structural brain abnormalities, severe neurodevelopmental delay, cataracts, growth impairment, and anemia. In cultured cells, overexpression of VPS4A mutants caused enlarged endosomal vacuoles resembling those induced by expression of known dominant-negative ATPase-defective forms of VPS4A. Proband-derived fibroblasts had enlarged endosomal structures with abnormal accumulation of the ESCRT protein IST1 on the limiting membrane. VPS4A function was also required for normal endosomal morphology and IST1 localization in iPSC-derived human neurons. Mutations affected other ESCRT-dependent cellular processes, including regulation of centrosome number, primary cilium morphology, nuclear membrane morphology, chromosome segregation, mitotic spindle formation, and cell cycle progression. We thus characterize a distinct multisystem disorder caused by mutations affecting VPS4A and demonstrate that its normal function is required for multiple human developmental and cellular processes.",

The infection triggers immune response against infected cells that leads to the destruction of hepatic cells. This destruction has two consequences: leaking ALT and AST liver enzymes which increases during the course of disease and accumulation of bilirubin- a red pigmented compound released from dead red cells- which causes the yellow coloration of eyes and skin. These viruses transmit through diverse routes i.e. blood transfusion, sexual contacts and consuming water or food contaminated by feces. Enteric hepatitis viruses use the latter route for transmission; hence their outbreaks are more common in underdeveloped countries. There are currently two distinguished enteric hepatitis viruses, hepatitis A and hepatitis E. These viruses belong to different family of viruses and their epidemiological characteristics are different. These infections can be diagnosed by an ELISA for IgM antibody. A vaccine has been developed in last decade of twentieth century for hepatitis A virus, which is administered mostly in the developed world i.e. U.S and Japan. Treatment for these infections is mostly supportive; however, in the case of fulminant hepatitis the liver transplantation might be necessary.",

Immune modulating antibodies have recently emerged as a highly promising treatment modality in multiple cancer types. We present results from the first study to evaluate the immune modulating antibody MDV9300 (pidilizumab) in pediatric patients with DIPG. All patients aged 3 years and older, diagnosed with DIPG between February 2014 and June 2015 in Israel, were offered to participate in the study. Enrolled patients were started on biweekly 6 mg/kg MDV9300 after radiation completion. Treatment was continued until disease progression on imaging. Patients were followed biweekly for the occurrence of neurological deficit toxicities and side effects. Secondary endpoints were event free survival and overall survival. Of 13 children diagnosed with DIPG during the study period, nine were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent radiotherapy and none had chemotherapy. A total of 83 cycles of MDV9300 (range 2-16) were applied. The main side effects were neutropenia (CTCAE grade 1-3), mild to moderate fatigue, and acute elevation of blood pressure. Four patients died within 1 year of the diagnosis, another three died within 2 years and two children are still alive nearly 30 months from diagnosis, with stable disease. The median event free survival is 9.3 months (range 6.8-24) and the median overall survival is 15.6 months (range 6.9-28). Preliminary results demonstrate that MDV9300 treatment is safe and may be effective in the treatment of children with DIPG.",

Immunomodulation with the antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibodies has shown to mediate tumor shrinkage and extend overall survival from several pivotal phase I/II studies in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. This has prompted multiple large ongoing phase III trials with the expectation for fast-track FDA approvals to satisfy unmet medical needs. Compounds targeting the programmed death-1 pathway that are in clinical trials fall into two major categories, namely antiprogrammed death-1 antibodies: Nivolumab, MK-3475, and pidilizumab; and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 antibodies: MPDL3280A, BMS-936559, MEDI4736, and MSB0010718C. We reviewed the clinical efficacy and safety of each compound based upon major registered clinical trials and published clinical data. Overall, response rate of more than 20% is consistently seen across all these trials, with maximal response of approximately 50% achieved by certain single antiprogrammed death-1 agents or when used in combination with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade. The responses seen are early, durable, and have continued after treatment discontinuation. Immune-related adverse events are the most common side effects seen in these clinical trials. Overall, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are the most common organ systems affected by these compounds while hepatic, endocrine, and neurologic events are less frequent. These side effects are low grade, manageable, and typically resolve within a relatively short time frame with a predictable resolution pattern given proper management. We therefore propose detailed guidelines for management of major immune-related adverse events that are anticipated with antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapies based on general experience with other monoclonal antibodies and the established management algorithms for immune-related adverse events for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade with ipilimumab. We anticipate that the antiprogrammed death-1 strategy will become a viable and crucial clinical strategy for cancer therapy.",

Advances and in-depth understanding of the biology of melanoma and its interaction with the immune system have led to the development of some of antagonistic antibodies to the programmed death 1 pathway (PD-1) and one of its ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which are demonstrating high clinical benefit rates and tolerability. Blocking the immune-regulatory checkpoints that limit T-cell responses to melanoma upon PD-1/PD-L1 modulation has provided clinically validated targets for cancer immunotherapy. Combinations with other anti-melanoma agents may result in additional benefits. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers. Long-term survivors already have been reported with these therapies. In this review, we discuss the current state of anti-PD-1 agents, the evidence in the literature to support the combination of anti-PD-1 antibodies with other anti-cancer agents and discuss the future directions for rational design of clinical trials that keep on increasing the number of long-term survivors.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25999597": "Advances in understanding of the immune microenvironment have highlighted the role of immunosuppressive T cell, myeloid, dendritic and monocytic sub-populations in inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response. The role of B cells in modulating the immune response to solid tumors as well as lymphoid malignancies is less well understood. Murine models of autoimmune disease have defined B regulatory cell (Breg) subsets with immune suppressive activity, including B cell subsets that express IL-10, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2, which can facilitate T regulatory cell recruitment and expansion. Multiple murine tumor models point to the existence of similar immune suppressive B cell sub-populations that can migrate into tumor deposits and acquire an immune suppressive phenotype, which then leads to attenuation of the local anti-tumor immune response. Other murine models of viral or chemically induced skin carcinogenesis have identified a pivotal role for B cells in promoting inflammation and carcinogenesis. While many human solid tumors demonstrate significant B cell infiltration and/or tertiary lymphoid structure formation, the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating B cells and their effects on immunity are poorly understood. Recent successes in early Phase I/II trials using anti-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies such as nivolumab or pidilizumab directed against PD-1 in the setting of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas validate the therapeutic utility of reversing B cell-mediated immune suppression. Further studies to define Breg subsets, and mechanisms of suppression, may provide new avenues for modulation of the immune response and meaningful therapeutic intervention in both lymphoid and solid tumors.",

However, their efficacy may be limited by immunosuppressive elements in the immune system and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, strategies to reverse the effects of the immunosuppressive elements are needed. We observed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) were increased in the peripheral blood at diagnosis and persisted in high numbers after induction of clinical remission with a cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen in FL patients. High levels of peripheral blood Tregs prior to therapy were associated with decreased progression-free survival in FL patients treated with either chemotherapy or combination immunotherapy that targeted CD20 and PD-1 with monoclonal antibodies rituximab and pidilizumab, respectively. Intratumoral and peripheral blood Tregs potently suppressed autologous antitumor effector T cells in FL. However, the effects of FL Tregs could be reversed by triggering Toll-like receptors (TLR) with TLR ligands Pam3 CSK4 (TLR 1/2), flagellin (TLR 5), and CpG-B (TLR 9), and/or OX40. The TLR ligands synergized with each other as well as OX40 signaling to inhibit Tregs. Furthermore, they restored the function of FL tumor-specific effector T cells. Our results suggest that a state of tolerance exists in FL patients at diagnosis and after induction of clinical remission, and agents that activate TLRs 1/2, 5, and 9, and OX40 may serve as adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapeutic strategies and preventive vaccines against infectious diseases in these patients.",

Since there are no positive markers to reliably classify TNBC, these tumours are not yet treated with targeted therapies. Perhaps for this reason they are the most aggressive form of breast carcinomas. However, the clinical observation that these patients do not carry a uniformly dismal prognosis, coupled with data coming from pathology and epidemiology, suggests that this negative definition is not capturing a single clinical entity, but several. We critically evaluate this evidence in this paper, reviewing clinical and epidemiological data and new studies that aim to subclassify TNBC. Moreover, evidence on the role of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on TNBC progression, response to chemotherapy and patient outcome have been published. The heterogeneity, observed even at TILs level, highlights the idea that TNBC is much more than a single disease with a unique treatment. The exploration of the immune environment present at the tumour site could indeed help in answering the question 'How many diseases is TNBC' and will help to define prognosis and eventually develop new therapies, by stimulating the immune effector cells or by inhibiting immunological repressor molecules. In this review, we focus on the prospect of the patient's diverse immune signatures within the tumour as potential biomarkers and how they could be modulated to fight the disease.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26387133": "The so called \"Triple Negative Breast Cancer\" (TNBC) represents approximately 15-20% of breast cancers. This acronym simply means that the tumour does not express oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and does not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. Despite this unambiguous definition, TNBCs are an heterogeneous group of tumours with just one common clinical feature: a distinctly aggressive nature with higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Because of the absence of well-defined molecular targets, cytotoxic chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for TNBC. In the last decades, the use of more aggressive chemotherapy has produced a clear improvement of the prognosis in women with TNBC, but this approach results in an unacceptable deterioration in the quality of life, also if some support therapies try to relieve patients from distress. In addition, there is the general belief that it is impossible to further improve the prognosis of TNBC patients with chemotherapy alone. In view of that, there is a feverish search for new \"clever drugs\" able both to rescue chemo-resistant, and to reduce the burden of chemotherapy in chemo-responsive TNBC patients. A major obstacle to identifying actionable targets in TNBC is the vast disease heterogeneity both inter-tumour and intra-tumour and years of study have failed to demonstrate a single unifying alteration that is targetable in TNBC. TNBC is considered the subtype that best benefits from the neoadjuvant model, since the strong correlation between pathological Complete Response and long-term Disease-Free-Survival in these patients. In this review, we discuss the recent discoveries that have furthered our understanding of TNBC, with a focus on the subtyping of TNBC.

Various studies have been reported in western literature on TNBCs, all highlighting the poor prognosis of this subtype. However, extensive data from India is lacking. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological and clinical profile of TNBCs at our institute. This was the retrospective study carried out in Tertiary Cancer Care Center in South India. Case files of all breast cancer patients were reviewed from the hospital database registered in 1 year and TNBC patients were selected for the study.

Median age of presentation was 44.5 years. About 94% (79/84) of patients had first full-term delivery before the age of 30 years. The most common presenting symptom was left sided breast lump. Locally advanced and early breast cancer (EBC) was 51% (43/84) and 42% (36/84), respectively. Metastatic breast cancer was seen in five patients. The highest numbers of patients were node negative disease (36.9%) [31/84], followed by N1 30.95% (26/84).

In 2010 the NTP reversed its decision and shifted back to SD rats because of reproductive issues with the Wistar strain. For post hoc comparative analyses, we report minimal practical differences in Functional Observational Battery (FOB) data from a large sample of male and female Wistar-Han and SD rats. In summarizing data from the preclinical safety evaluations of the CNS effects of new drugs using the FOB, it is crucial to understand the value of not only how the functional expression of drug effects in the rat are predictive of the human response, but also how and why they differ. What we can predict from the behavioral and physiological response of the designated test system to drug administration is the foundation of \"generalizability\" to the human's response.

It is demonstrated that spectral intensities corresponding to a number of endogenous metabolites do not show Gaussian distributions and there is evidence for bimodality for some metabolites. Additionally, despite the visual similarity of the NMR spectra from the two strains of rat, the descriptor distributions and the statistics derived from them revealed differences in the metabolite profiles, which clearly distinguished the two populations.

Ophthalmologic or histopathologic examinations revealed a higher incidence of corneal opacities or corneal mineralization in Wistar Han rats. Restricted feeding of SD rats resulted in intermediate values for body weights and food consumption between the ad libitum fed SD and Wistar Han rats, and WBC and AST were lower than those in the ad libitum fed SD rats.

Motor activity, startle response, learning and memory testing, and neurological (quantitative and qualitative) examinations were conducted using three groups of control, prenatally exposed (to Methylazoxymethanol [MAM] on gestation Day 15) and acutely treated (with IDPN, MK-801 or Chlorpromazine) animals for each strain. The positive controls produced clear effects in most endpoints investigated, with limited functional differences in baseline behavior and positive control sensitivity. However, SD rats were considerably more susceptible to MAM-induced learning and memory impairments and neurological damage. These data highlight differential sensitivity between the strains, which may require risk assessment consideration for developmental neurotoxicants.",

The effects of rat strain and gender in <i>in vitro</i> metabolism were investigated in Sprague Dawley (SD) and Wister Han (WH) rats based on the hepatocyte metabolic profiles of 14 small molecule drugs. Similarities were found between the hepatocyte metabolic clearances of SD and WH strains, suggesting that only one strain can be confidently used for the evaluation of hepatic clearance. Neither strain of rat was preferable over the other to cover human metabolites. Higher similarities in metabolic pathways were found between the same gender than the same strain. Differences in metabolite identities, metabolite formation rates and potential biotransformation pathways were observed between SD and WH rat strains. Eleven metabolites from six drugs were \"disproportionally\" formed between SD and WH rats. The use of a specific rat strain model and gender for ADME and toxicity testing should, therefore, be carefully considered as metabolic profiles may differ, even though metabolic clearance was similar between SD and WH rats.",

Dilution linearity, spiked recovery, intra- and inter-assay precision, functional sensitivity, matrix effects, and frozen stability were assessed across five laboratories. Reference ranges were generated for male Sprague Dawley and Han Wistar rats. Acceptable performance was defined as an overall assay coefficient of variation \u2264 20% with an intraday LLOQ \u2264 20 pg/ml. Intra- and inter-assay precision and functional sensitivity (\u22646.4 pg/ml) generally met these criteria, but with occasional evidence of greater variability, particularly at lower concentrations. Dilution linearity was acceptable with occasional low recovery. Acceptable recovery of kit calibrators from rat serum confirmed the absence of matrix effects. Matched serum and plasma samples gave comparable results. The signal increased on freezing, remained constant for \u22653 freeze-thaw cycles and was generally stable for at least 8 weeks. Mean inhibin B ranged from 33.5 to 140.6 pg/ml in adult rats across laboratories, with some evidence for a decline from 6 to 9 weeks of age. Power calculations using preliminary reference range data indicated 10 animals/group would generally detect a 40% decrease in inhibin B at AstraZeneca, but laboratories with lower control values would require larger groups. The assay meets the analytical performance criteria; however, precision at the low end of the standard curve, biological variability, and low control values observed in some laboratories indicate that the utility of the assay may be limited in some laboratories.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764299": "A previous report of this work (Ringeissen et al. 2003) described the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical data analysis (MVDA) to identify novel biomarkers of peroxisome proliferation (PP) in Wistar Han rats. Two potential biomarkers of peroxisome proliferation in the rat were described, N-methylnicotinamide (NMN) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4PY). The inference from these results was that the tryptophan-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) pathway was altered in correlation with peroxisome proliferation, a hypothesis subsequently confirmed by TaqMan analysis of the relevant genes encoding two key enzymes in the pathway, aminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.45) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.19). The objective of the present study was to investigate these data further and identify other metabolites in the NMR spectrum correlating equally with PP. MVDA Partial Least Squares (PLS) models were constructed that provided a better prediction of PP in Wistar Han rats than levels of 4PY and NMN alone. The resulting Wistar Han rat predictive models were then used to predict PP in a test group of Sprague Dawley rats following administration of fenofibrate. The models predicted the presence or absence of PP (above on arbitrary threshold of &gt;2-fold mean control) in all Sprague Dawley rats in the test group.",

The animals were kept under 12 h light: 12 h darkness (12 L:12 D) and killed 7 h after the onset of light and darkness, respectively. The parameters examined were pineal protein content, serotonin and melatonin levels and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) activity. All the parameters examined revealed interstrain differences, independently of whether the data were expressed per pineal or per mg protein. The variation coefficients for the various parameters were relatively high. They were mostly smaller when the data were expressed per pineal rather than per mg protein. No striking differences existed between the variation coefficients in inbred and outbred rats. When pineal size and the melatonin-related parameters expressed per pineal were used to assess the melatonin-synthesizing capacity of the pineal glands, it was found that the outbred Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats and the inbred LEWIS-derived (LEW/Han) rats, all of which were albinos, had the most active pineals. Intermediate activity was noted in the hooded E3/Han and BDE/Han and the albino BDII/Han rats. The smallest and least active pineals were found in the totally pigmented BN/Han and DA/Han rats. The results taken together show that different stocks and strains exhibit significant differences in pineal size and melatonin-forming capacity. Albino rats appear to have larger and more active pineals than pigmented rats.",

This is due in part to the large database for this outbred rat available for comparison of litter data, and the low incidence of fetal malformations and variations. The following study was conducted to generate information on potential embryo-fetal developmental defects and litter data in another outbred stock of rat, the Wistar Hannover. One hundred fifty pregnant female Wistar Hannover rats (Tac:Glx:WIfBR) were dosed orally once per day with distilled water from Gestation Days (GD) 6 through 17 covering the time from implantation to closure of the hard palate (GD0 = day of insemination). Caesarean sections were performed on Day 20 of gestation. All fetuses were examined for external, visceral and skeletal malformations and variations. Macroscopic and histomorphologic examinations were also completed for the F0 females at termination. The percent pregnant (88%) and litter size (average 10.6) were found to be lower than that commonly reported for the Sprague-Dawley rat (Crl:CD (SD)BR; 95.4% and 14.6, respectively). Pre-implantation loss (14.1%), post-implantation loss (7.4%) and percent resorptions (7.2%) occurred at a higher incidence than typically seen in the Sprague-Dawley rat (5.9, 5.6 and 5.1%, respectively). The average fetal body weights for both the female and male rats were lower than those typically seen in the Sprague-Dawley rat. External, visceral and skeletal examination of the F1 fetuses revealed numerous malformations and variations which also occurred at higher incidences than those reported for the Sprague-Dawley rat. Routine macroscopic and histomorphologic examination showed there were no changes that would be interpreted to have impaired mating performance, fertility or gestation. Thus, this study provides information on the reproductive effects and the background incidence of embryo-fetal development defects that could be used for comparison to those identified when using this outbred rat for developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, as well as for comparison to the more commonly used rat stock, the Sprague-Dawley rat. For the parameters evaluated, the Wistar Hannover rat had greater variability and an increased incidence of spontaneous malformations as compared to the Crl:CD (SD)BR Sprague-Dawley rat. These findings should be considered if this stock of rat is selected in the conduct of developmental and reproductive toxicity studies.",

In each facility, 20 or 22 female rats were dosed with vehicle solution during the organogenesis period. As a result, no abnormalities in clinical signs and necropsy findings in dams were found. Body weights and food consumption in dams were lower than those in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The number of corpora lutea (13.3 vs. 16.0 in SD) and implantations (11.8 vs. 14.7) were fewer, and fetal body weights (3.66 vs. 3.70) and placental weights (0.42 vs. 0.45) tended to be lower than those in SD rats. Regarding the fetal abnormalities, the incidence of several findings such as the persistent left umbilical artery (10.4% vs. 1.1%) and cervical (5.2% vs. 0.4%), full (7.4% vs. 0.9%) or short supernumerary (64.5% vs. 9.9%) and wavy ribs (6.6% vs. 0.3%) was higher than that in SD rats. Our present study showed that they maintained a sufficient number of live fetuses and the difference in the fetal sex ratio was not observed. In conclusion, Wistar Han rats were considered to be a suitable strain for embryo-fetal development toxicity study. Since the incidence of several abnormalities was higher than that in SD rats, it may be said that to accumulate background control data is important to evaluate the embryo-fetal development toxicity study using Wistar Han rats.",

After animals were treated with the typical inducers \u03b2-naphthoflavone (BNF), dexamethasone (DEX) and phenobarbital (PB), the levels of O-dealkylation of ethoxyresorufin (EROD), methoxyresorufin (MROD), pentoxyresorufin (PROD) and benzyloxyresorufin (BROD) activity were determined using responsive catalytic reactions to study CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2B, respectively. A maximal induction of EROD and MROD was found in BNF-treated animals from all strains (2.4- to 15.1-fold) except DBA/2 (0.9- to 1.8-fold). C57BL/6 mice had the strongest BNF-induced EROD (15.1-fold) and MROD (8.3-fold) activities. No differences in BNF-induced EROD and MROD activities were observed between males and females. However, the EROD activity of Wistar rats and the MROD activity of Sprague Dawley rats were higher in males than females. DEX induced PROD activity only in mice (1.3- to 7.1-fold), but not in rats and guinea pigs (0.2- to 1.1-fold). However, induction of BROD activity was found in DEX-treated mice and rats (1.5 to 12.5-fold), but not in guinea pigs (0.3 to 0.4-fold). PB caused a significant elevation of PROD (1.7- to 10.4-fold) and BROD (31- to 13.2-fold) activities in all the animals. PB-induced BROD activity was higher in females than males in Sprague Dawley rats. These observations strongly suggest that the choice of experimental animal strain, species and inducer is of critical importance for studies of drug metabolism and interaction.",

Negative trends (5 out of 80 cases) were observed for skin fibromas in F344 males, for follicular cell adenomas in Han Wistar females and in Sprague-Dawley males and females, and for follicular cell carcinomas in Sprague-Dawley males. Positive trends (8 out of 80 cases) were observed for skin keratoacanthomas in Han Wistar males, for C-cell adenomas in BASF Wistar males and females, for stromal polyps in Han Wistar and Sprague-Dawley females, and for mesenteric lymph node hemangiomas in Han Wistar and Sprague-Dawley males and in BASF Wistar females. In 67 out of 80 cases there were no statistically significant trends. Tumor drift was not common but occurred far more often in outbred rat strains (Wistar and Sprague-Dawley) than in the inbred rat strain (F344). This observation suggests that tumor predisposition is genetically determined, that tumor drift is primarily caused by genetic drift and that non-genotoxic carcinogens operate by facilitating the expression of tumor predisposition in target cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749500": "Laboratory strains of rats are a commonly used subject to study play behavior. Recent research has shown that play in one laboratory strain of rat (e.g., Long-Evans hooded) differs in a number of ways from its wild counterparts. These findings suggest that domestication affects some aspects of play behavior. However, there are multiple strains of laboratory rats, which have been domesticated through different lineages all derived from wild rats and it cannot be assumed that all domestic strains are identical in their play. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the play behavior of three other strains of laboratory rats (e.g., Wistar, Sprague-Dawley, and Brown Norway). All strains were similar to each other as they all engaged in high frequencies of play, tolerated similar interanimal distances before initiating playful defense and displayed similar acrobatic capacities, suggesting domestication produces some common changes in play and other factors that influence play. However, strains differed significantly from one another in the use of tactics that promote bodily contact during play. Indeed, in this regard, some strains were more similar to wild rats than others, suggesting that some domestication-induced changes are either unique or more prominent in some laboratory strains than others. Such a mosaic pattern of transformation not only offers the possibility of using strain differences to characterize the genetic factors contributing to different facets of play, but also cautions researchers from making rat-general conclusions from studies on any one strain.",

Therefore, behavioral phenotyping of laboratory animals belonging to different strains is important. The aim of the present study was to compare the variation in allothetic visuospatial learning in most commonly used laboratory rat strains: inbred Wistar (W) and Sprague-Dawley (SD), outcrossed Wistar/Sprague-Dawley (W/SD), and outbred Long Evans (LE) rats. All rats were trained to the arbitrary performance criterion of 83 % correct responses in the partially baited 12-arm radial maze allowing for simultaneous evaluation of both working and reference memory. In the present study, testing albino versus pigmented and inbred versus outcrossed rats revealed significant strain-dependent differences with the inbred SD rats manifesting lower performance on all learning measures compared to other strains. On the other hand, the outcrossed W/SD rats showed a lower frequency of reference memory errors and faster rate of task acquisition compared to both LE and W rats, with W rats showing a lower frequency of working memory errors compared to other strains. In conclusion, albinism apparently did not reduce the animals' performance in the allothetic visuospatial learning task, while outcrossing improved the spatial learning. A differential effect of strain on the contribution of each error type to the animals' overall performance was observed. The strain-dependent differences were more pronounced between subpopulations of learning-deficient individuals (\"poor\" learners), and generally the reference memory errors contributed more to the final behavioral output than did the working memory errors.",

In contrast, no comparable investigations to date have been undertaken for the vestibular organ in different breeds of the rat. Vestibular organs of two breeds of rat (Wistar, Sprague-Dawley) were analyzed morphologically and morphometrically by means of microdissection techniques in order to determine the mechanical sensitivity of the cupula according to Oman et al; (Acta Otolaryngol., 1987;103:1-13, 1987). Differences in shape of the lateral semicircular duct exist between the two breeds and the cupular mechanical sensitivity is significantly higher in Wistar than in Sprague-Dawley rats. With respect to the other semicircular ducts, no differences in shape were found between the two strains. The cupular mechanical sensitivity of the anterior semicircular duct, however, is higher in Wistar than in Sprague-Dawley rats. The breeds also differ in the shape of their utriculus; obviously a correlation exists between the latter and the cupular mechanical sensitivity of the semicircular ducts. There are differences in the vestibular organs between the two breeds of the laboratory rat investigated. The cupular mechanical sensitivity of the semicircular duct does not seem to be correlated to body mass. The size and morphology of the utriculus influence the mechanical sensitivity of a single duct, but differences only become significant if other parameters also differ.",

Quantitative analysis of urine protein, Complement C3 and C4, and anti-ds DNA antibody were conducted. HE and PAS staining and TEM analysis were employed to observe the pathological changes in renal tissue. Significant elevation on urine protein and anti-dsDNA and reduction on Complement C3 and C4 were observed in MRL/lpr mice when comparing the controls in same age. Staining and TEM analysis observed several pathological changes in glomerulus among MRL/lpr mice, including cellular enlargement, basement membrane thickening, and increased cellularcasts. The linear regression analysis found the optical density of IFIT1 was inversely associated with F-actin, Nephrin, and Podocin, but not Synatopodin.

Peripheral blood of another 10 SLE patients was extracted to obtain specimens of white blood cell lysate. Molecular cloning and a modified gluthion S-transferase (GST)-pull down assay were used to capture the protein interacting with IFIT1 in the specimens of white blood cell lysate. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) was preformed to identify the captured protein that could interact with IFIT1. Twenty-nine sex and age-matched healthy persons were used as controls. By real-time PCR showed that the IFIT1Delta Ct value (x +/- s) was 2.344 +/- 1.200 in the SLE patients and was 3.734 +/- 1.274 in the controls (P &lt; 0.001), showing a significant up-regulation in SLE patients. IFIT1 was cloned and GST-IFIT1 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. GST-IFIT1 fusion protein was further purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B column, and was treated as bait to capture prey from peripheral white blood cell lysate of SLE patients.

Clustering of the gene expression profile was compared with the clinical immune phenotype. SLE-induced genes that were over- or under-expressed were determined and independently validated using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. To study their potential function and the possible pathways involved, a candidate gene was cloned and a GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was further purified using the glutathione Sepharose 4B system, and was treated as bait to capture prey from SLE peripheral white blood cell lysate. MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight) mass spectrometry was then performed to determine the prey protein. Similarity was found between the gene expression profile and the immune phenotype clusters of the SLE patients. More than 20 disease-associated genes were identified, some of which have not been related to SLE previously. Of these genes, a cluster of interferon-induced genes were highly correlated. IFIT1 (interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) was one of these genes, and overexpression of its mRNA was confirmed independently by real-time PCR in a larger population (40 SLE patients and 29 normal controls). An IFIT1 protein- protein interaction study showed that IFIT1 may interact with Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The gene expression profile seems to be the molecular basis of the diverse immune phenotype of SLE. On the basis of the SLE-related genes found in this study, we suggest that the interferon-related immune pathway is important in the pathogenesis of SLE. IFIT1 is the first gene described as a candidate gene for SLE, and may function by activating Rho proteins through interaction with Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. IFIT1 and the interferon-related pathway may provide potential targets for novel interventions in the treatment of SLE.",

In vitro assays were developed to validate the variants identified (fibroblast assay, induced pluripotent stem cell [iPSC] derived retinal organoids, and a dynein motility assay). Four novel DYNC2H1 variants (V1, g.103327020_103327021dup; V2, g.103055779A&gt;T; V3, g.103112272C&gt;G; V4, g.103070104A&gt;C) and one previously reported variant (V5, g.103339363T&gt;G) were identified.

V1 and V2 impaired dynein-2 motility in vitro and perturbed IFT88 distribution within cilia. V3, homozygous in probands 2-4, is predicted to cause a PTC in a retina-predominant transcript. Analysis of retinal organoids showed that this new transcript expression increased with organoid differentiation. V4, a novel missense variant, was in trans with V5, previously associated with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD).

However, none of the IFT-B core complex proteins have been associated with nonsyndromic retinal dystrophies. Given the importance of ciliary transport in photoreceptor function and structural maintenance, we sought to investigate the impact of IFT (intraflagellar transport) mutations in nonsyndromic retinopathies. Whole exome sequencing was performed on 50 cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) patients that were previously screened for mutations in known retinal disease genes. The impact of candidate mutation was studied using in vitro cell system and in vivo zebrafish assay to determine the pathogenicity of the variant. Compound heterozygous mutations in IFT81, including one nonsense (c.1213C&gt;T, p.R405*) and one missense variant (c.1841T&gt;C, p.L614P), were identified in a nonsyndromic CRD proband. Extensive functional analyses of the missense variant in cell culture and zebrafish strongly suggests its pathogenic nature. Loss of IFT81 impairs ciliogenesis and, interestingly, the missense variant displayed significantly reduced rescue of ciliogenesis in the IFT81 knockdown in vitro system. Consistently, dramatic reduction of rescue efficiency of the ift81 mutant zebrafish embryo by mRNA with the missense variant was observed, further supporting its pathogenicity. Consistent with the function of the IFT-B complex in the maintenance of photoreceptor cilium, we report a case of mutations in a core IFT-B protein, IFT81. This represents the first report of mutations in IFT81 as a candidate gene for nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy, hence expanding the phenotype spectrum of IFT-B components.",

To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276 G&gt;T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802 T&gt;G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073 G&gt;A, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156 G&gt;A, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3 T&gt;A; and c.12575 G&gt;A, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. Careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting.",

A mutational screening was performed in 378 additional unrelated families for the exon-intron boundaries of the ABHD12 gene. To establish a genotype-phenotype correlation, individuals who were homozygous or compound heterozygotes of mutations in ABHD12 underwent exhaustive clinical examinations by ophthalmologists, neurologists, and otologists. DNA sequence variants, best-corrected visual acuity, visual field assessments, electroretinogram responses, magnetic resonance imaging, and audiography.

Another homozygous mutation (p.His372Gln) was detected in 1 affected individual (RP-1487) from a cohort of 378 unrelated arRP and syndromic RP patients. After exhaustive clinical examinations by neurologists and otologists, the 4 affected members of the RP-1292 had no polyneuropathy or ataxia, and the sensorineural hearing loss and cataract were attributed to age or the normal course of the RP, whereas the affected members of the families W08-1833 and RP-1487 showed clearly symptoms associated with polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, RP, and early-onset cataract (PHARC) syndrome. Null mutations in the ABHD12 gene lead to PHARC syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease including polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, RP, and early-onset cataract. Our study allowed us to report 5 new mutations in ABHD12. This is the first time missense mutations have been described for this gene. Furthermore, these findings are expanding the spectrum of phenotypes associated with ABHD12 mutations ranging from PHARC syndrome to a nonsyndromic form of retinal degeneration.",

The GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure) trial tests the hypotheses that omecamtiv mecarbil can safely improve symptoms, prevent clinical HF events, and delay CV death in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial. More than 8,000 patients with chronic symptomatic (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) HF, left ventricular ejection fraction \u226435%, elevated natriuretic peptides, and either current hospitalization for HF or history of hospitalization or emergency department visit for HF within a year of screening will be randomized to either oral placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil employing a pharmacokinetic-guided dose titration strategy using doses of 25, 37.5, or 50 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy outcome is the time to cardiovascular death or first HF event. The study has 90% power to assess a final hazard ratio of approximately 0.80 in cardiovascular death, the first secondary outcome. The GALACTIC-HF trial is the first trial examining whether selectively increasing cardiac contractility in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction will result in improved clinical outcomes.

We compared the molecular mechanism of action of OM on the interaction of atrial and ventricular myosin with actin using an optical trap and an in vitro motility assay. In concentrations up to 0.5 \u03bcM, OM did not affect the step size of a myosin molecule but reduced it at a higher OM level. OM substantially prolonged the interaction of both isoforms of myosin with actin. However, the interaction characteristics of ventricular myosin with actin were more sensitive to OM than those of atrial myosin. Our results, obtained at the level of isolated proteins, can explain why the impact of OM in therapeutic concentrations on the contractile function of the atrium is less significant as compared to those of the ventricle.",

At higher plasma concentrations, these agents may be associated with myocardial ischemia and impaired diastolic function. An ongoing phase 3 clinical trial will estimate the clinical efficacy and safety of omecamtiv mecarbil.

Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) is a compound that has been developed to treat systolic heart failure via targeting the cardiac myosin heavy chain to increase myocardial contractility. Biophysical and biochemical studies have found that OM increases calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) sensitivity of contraction by prolonging the myosin working stroke and increasing the actin-myosin cross-bridge duty ratio. Most in vitro studies probing the effects of OM on cross-bridge kinetics and muscle force production have been conducted at subphysiological temperature, even though temperature plays a critical role in enzyme activity and cross-bridge function. Herein, we used skinned, ventricular papillary muscle strips from rats to investigate the effects of [OM] on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force production, cross-bridge kinetics, and myocardial viscoelasticity at physiological temperature (37\u00b0C). We find that OM only increases myocardial contractility at submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation levels and not maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation levels. As [OM] increased, the kinetic rate constants for cross-bridge recruitment and detachment slowed for both submaximal and maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated conditions. These findings support a mechanism by which OM increases cardiac contractility at physiological temperature via increasing cross-bridge contributions to thin-filament activation as cross-bridge kinetics slow and the duration of cross-bridge attachment increases. Thus, force only increases at submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation due to cooperative recruitment of neighboring cross-bridges, because thin-filament activation is not already saturated. In contrast, OM does not increase myocardial force production for maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated conditions at physiological temperature because cooperative activation of thin filaments may already be saturated.",

We find OM does not change the overall actin affinity. Transient kinetic experiments suggest that there are two kinetic pathways in the presence of OM. The dominant pathway results in a slow transition between actomyosin\u00b7ADP states and increases the time myosin is strongly bound to actin.

Another compound, CK-1032100, has much lower affinity to RyR-2 than omecamtiv mecarbil, while it still has a moderate affinity to myosin. It was concluded that further research starting from the chemical structure of CK-1032100 may result a better myosin activator burdened probably less by the RyR-2 binding side effect. It also is possible, however, that the selectivity of omecamtiv mecarbil to myosin over RyR-2 cannot be substantially improved, because similar moieties seem to be responsible for the high affinity to both myosin and RyR-2.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25680381": "We determined the effect of Omecamtiv Mecarbil, a novel allosteric effector of cardiac muscle myosin, on the kinetic and \"in vitro\" motility properties of the porcine ventricular heavy meromyosin (PV-HMM). Omecamtiv Mecarbil increases the equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step (M-ATP \u21c4 M-ADP-Pi) from 2.4 to 6 as determined by quench flow, but the maximal rates of both the hydrolysis step and tryptophan fluorescence increase are unchanged by the drug. OM also increases the amplitude of the fast phase of phosphate dissociation (AM-ADP-Pi \u2192 AM-ADP + Pi) that is associated with force production in muscle by 4-fold. These results suggest a mechanism in which hydrolysis of M-ATP to M-ADP-Pi occurs both before and after the recovery stroke, but rapid acceleration of phosphate dissociation by actin occurs only on post-recovery stroke A-M-ADP-Pi. One of the more dramatic effects of OM on PV-HMM is a 14-fold decrease in the unloaded shortening velocity measured by the in vitro motility assay. The increase in flux through phosphate dissociation and the unchanged rate of ADP dissociation (AM-ADP \u2192 AM + ADP) by the drug produce a higher duty ratio motor in which a larger fraction of myosin heads are strongly bound to actin filaments. The increased internal load produced by a larger fraction of strongly attached crossbridges explains the reduced rate of in vitro motility velocity in the presence of OM and predicts that the drug will produce slower and stronger contraction of cardiac muscle.",

Decreases in myocardial contractility and shortening of ventricular systole are characteristic of systolic heart failure and might be improved by a new therapeutic class, cardiac myosin activators. We report the first study of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, in patients with systolic heart failure. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial investigating the effects of omecamtiv mecarbil (formerly CK-1827452), given intravenously for 2, 24, or 72 h to patients with stable heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction receiving guideline-indicated treatment. Clinical assessment (including vital signs, echocardiograms, and electrocardiographs) and testing of plasma drug concentrations took place during and after completion of each infusion. The primary aim was to assess safety and tolerability of omecamtiv mecarbil. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00624442\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT00624442</a>. 45 patients received 151 infusions of active drug or placebo. Placebo-corrected, concentration-dependent increases in left ventricular ejection time (up to an 80 ms increase from baseline) and stroke volume (up to 9\u00b77 mL) were recorded, associated with a small reduction in heart rate (up to 2\u00b77 beats per min; p&lt;0\u00b70001 for all three measures). Higher plasma concentrations were also associated with reductions in end-systolic (decrease of 15 mL at &gt;500 ng/mL, p=0\u00b70026) and end-diastolic volumes (16 mL, p=0\u00b70096) that might have been more pronounced with increased duration of infusion. Cardiac ischaemia emerged at high plasma concentrations (two patients, plasma concentrations roughly 1750 ng/mL and 1350 ng/mL). For patients tolerant of all study drug infusions, no consistent pattern of adverse events with either dose or duration emerged. Omecamtiv mecarbil improved cardiac function in patients with heart failure caused by left ventricular dysfunction and could be the first in class of a new therapeutic agent. Cytokinetics Inc.",

Existing drugs increase cardiac contractility indirectly through signaling cascades but are limited by their mechanism-related adverse effects. To avoid these limitations, we previously developed omecamtiv mecarbil, a small-molecule, direct activator of cardiac myosin. Here, we show that it binds to the myosin catalytic domain and operates by an allosteric mechanism to increase the transition rate of myosin into the strongly actin-bound force-generating state. Paradoxically, it inhibits adenosine 5'-triphosphate turnover in the absence of actin, which suggests that it stabilizes an actin-bound conformation of myosin. In animal models, omecamtiv mecarbil increases cardiac function by increasing the duration of ejection without changing the rates of contraction. Cardiac myosin activation may provide a new therapeutic approach for systolic heart failure.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26025342": " Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) is a novel inotropic agent that prolongs systolic ejection time and increases ejection fraction through myosin ATPase activation. We hypothesized that a potentially favorable energetic effect of unloading the left ventricle, and thus reduction of wall stress, could be counteracted by the prolonged contraction time and ATP-consumption. Postischemic left ventricular dysfunction was created by repetitive left coronary occlusions in 7 pigs (7 healthy pigs also included). In both groups, systolic ejection time and ejection fraction increased after OM (0.75 mg/kg loading for 10 minutes, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/min continuous infusion). Cardiac efficiency was assessed by relating myocardial oxygen consumption to the cardiac work indices, stroke work, and pressure-volume area. To circumvent potential neurohumoral reflexes, cardiac efficiency was additionally assessed in ex vivo mouse hearts and isolated myocardial mitochondria. OM impaired cardiac efficiency; there was a 31% and 23% increase in unloaded myocardial oxygen consumption in healthy and postischemic pigs, respectively. Also, the oxygen cost of the contractile function was increased by 63% and 46% in healthy and postischemic pigs, respectively. The increased unloaded myocardial oxygen consumption was confirmed in OM-treated mouse hearts and explained by an increased basal metabolic rate. Adding the myosin ATPase inhibitor, 2,3-butanedione monoxide abolished all surplus myocardial oxygen consumption in the OM-treated hearts. Omecamtiv mecarbil, in a clinically relevant model, led to a significant myocardial oxygen wastage related to both the contractile and noncontractile function. This was mediated by that OM induces a continuous activation in resting myosin ATPase.",

It is presumed that interaction with the bacterial cell surface and membrane permeabilization by defensins is an important step in the killing process. In this study, we have compared interactions of three human \u03b1-defensins HNP3, HNP4, HD5 and human \u03b2-defensins HBD1-4 that are active against Escherichia coli, with its cell surface and inner membrane as well as negatively charged model membranes. We have also included the inactive \u03b1-defensin HD6 in the study. Among the \u03b1-defensins, HNP4, HD5 and HD6 were more effective in increasing the zeta potential as compared to HNP3. Among the \u03b2-defensins, HBD1 was the least effective in increasing the zeta potential. The zeta potential modulation data indicate variations in the surface charge neutralizing ability of \u03b1- and \u03b2-defensins. Comparison of E. coli inner membrane and model membrane permeabilizing abilities indicated that HD5, HD6 and HBD1 do not permeabilize membranes. Although HBD4 does not permeabilize model membranes, considerable damage to the inner membrane of E. coli is observed. Our data indicate that mammalian defensins do not kill E. coli by a simple mechanism involving membrane permeabilization though their antibacterial potencies are very similar.",

Similar to the pharmacological profiles of hBD1 and hBD2, hBD4 had lower inhibitory effects on Kv1.1, Kv1.2, SKCa3, and IKCa channels. Subsequent mutagenesis and channel activation experiments confirmed that hBD3 binds in a manner similar to that of hBD1, interacting with the outer pore region of the Kv1.3 channel without affecting Kv1.3 channel activation.

Concerning the prophylactic and therapeutic applications of defensins, we then discuss the applicability of human defensins as antivirals that has been demonstrated in reports using animal models. Finally, we discuss the potential adjuvant-like activity of human defensins and propose an exploration of the 'defensin vaccine' concept to prime the body with a controlled supply of human defensins.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167344": "The fifth wave of A(H7N9) virus infection in China from 2016 to 2017 caused great concern due to the large number of individuals infected, the isolation of drug-resistant viruses, and the emergence of highly pathogenic strains. Antibodies against neuraminidase (NA) provide added benefit to hemagglutinin-specific immunity and may be important contributors to the effectiveness of A(H7N9) vaccines. We generated a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to identify antigenic domains on NA of the novel A(H7N9) virus and compared their functional properties. The loop formed in the region of residue 250 (250 loop) and the domain formed by the loops containing residues 370, 400, and 430 were identified as major antigenic regions. MAbs 1E8, 2F6, 10F4, and 11B2, which recognize these two antigenic domains, were characterized in depth. These four MAbs differ in their abilities to inhibit cleavage of small and large substrates (methyl-umbelliferyl-acetyl neuraminic acid [MU-NANA] and fetuin, respectively) in NA inhibition assays. 1E8 and 11B2 did not inhibit NA cleavage of either MU-NANA or fetuin, and 2F6 inhibited cleavage of fetuin alone, whereas 10F4 inhibited cleavage of both substrates. All four MAbs reduced the <i>in vitro</i> spread of viruses carrying either the wild-type N9 or N9 with antiviral-resistant mutations but to different degrees. These MAbs have different <i>in vivo</i> levels of effectiveness: 10F4 was the most effective in protecting mice against challenge with A(H7N9) virus, 2F6 was less effective, and 11B2 failed to protect BALB/c mice at the doses tested. Our study confirms that NA-specific antibodies can protect against A(H7N9) infection and suggests that <i>in vitro</i> properties can be used to rank antibodies with therapeutic potential.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The novel A(H7N9) viruses that emerged in China in 2013 continue to infect humans, with a high fatality rate. The most recent outbreak resulted in a larger number of human cases than previous epidemic waves. Due to the absence of a licensed vaccine and the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, there is a need to develop alternative approaches to prevent or treat A(H7N9) infection. We have made a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for neuraminidase (NA) of A(H7N9) viruses; some of these MAbs are effective in inhibiting viruses that are resistant to antivirals used to treat A(H7N9) patients. Binding avidity, inhibition of NA activity, and plaque formation correlated with the effectiveness of these MAbs to protect mice against lethal A(H7N9) virus challenge. This study identifies <i>in vitro</i> measures that can be used to predict the <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of NA-specific antibodies, providing a way to select MAbs for further therapeutic development.",

Therefore, we determined the relation between mutations in the NA and HA genome segments of 205 influenza A/H3N2 viruses isolated from patients in Japan during the five seasons from 2010 to 2015. The amino acid (AA) sequences of the NA and HA proteins in these isolates were then determined. In the 2011-2012 season, there was the emergence of isolates with NA and HA sequences containing AA93G (NA93G) and AA278K (HA278K), respectively (24/48 isolates, 50.0%). This was in contrast to NA93D-HA278N being detected exclusively in the previous 2010-2011 season (24/24 isolates, 100.0%). The isolates with the NA93G-HA278K substitutions became predominant in the following 2012-2013 season (95.8%, 46/48 isolates). The NA and HA phylogenetic trees of the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons were segregated by clades with NA93D-HA278N or NA93G-HA278K. In the subsequent 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 seasons, the strong relationship between NA93D-HA278N and NA93G-HA278K observed in the previous seasons, was no longer present and NA93G-HA278N (33/52 isolates, 63.5% in the 2014-2015 season) became predominant. In addition, the clades within the NA and HA trees could no longer be segregated based on NA AA93 and HA AA278. These findings suggest that the co-mutation of NA and HA AA sequences is present and may contribute to the formation of an epidemic lineage.",

VaxArray assays for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have been developed to address this need. In this report, we evaluate the use of these assays to assess the potency of HA and NA of an A/H3N2 subunit vaccine by determining the correlation between the amounts measured by VaxArray and the immunogenicity in mice. The antibody response after one and two doses of five formulations of the vaccine ranging from 5 \u00b5g/mL to 80 \u00b5g/mL of HA, was measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assays. For hemagglutinin, vaccine potency determined by VaxArray was equivalent to potency measured SRID and these amounts were predictive of immunogenicity, with excellent correlation between potency measured by VaxArray and the HAI geometric mean titers (GMT). Likewise, the amount of NA measured by VaxArray was predictive of the NAI GMT. The VaxArray NA assay reported non-detectable levels of intact NA for a sample that had been heat degraded at 56 \u00b0C for 20 h, demonstrating that the assay measures the native, active form of NA. Similarly, the HA potency measured by VaxArray in this heat-treated sample was very low when a monoclonal antibody was used to detect the amount of antigen bound. Importantly, the force degraded sample induced low HAI titers and the NAI titers were not measurable, supporting the conclusion that the VaxArray HA and NA assays measure the immunogenic forms of these A/H3N2 antigens. This study indicates that VaxArray assays can be used to assess the potency of HA and NA components in influenza vaccines as a proxy for immunogenicity.",

Mice were immunized intranasally with 0.1, 0.3 or 1microg of HA or NA together with the cholera toxin adjuvant, and then boosted intranasally with 0.3 microg of the adjuvant-combined HA or NA 4 weeks later. Two weeks after the second immunization, the mice were challenged by an infection of the upper respiratory tract with the homologous virus. After 3 days, nasal wash and serum specimens were collected for virus and Ab titration. The HA immunization induced HA-specific IgG Ab responses against A/Beijing HA, which depended on the H-2 haplotype of the strain: The B10.A (H-2(a)), B10.D2 (H-2(d)), B10.BR (H-2(k)) and B10 (H-2(b)) strains were the highest, high, intermediate and low responders, respectively. The nasal IgA responses were induced in the B10.A, B10.D2 and B10.BR strains, but not in the B10 strain. In parallel with Ab responses, the B10.A, B10.BR and B10.D2 strains were conferred significant protection at any dose of primary immunization, but the B10 strain was provided protection only at 1microg of HA. On the other hand, the NA immunization induced NA-specific Ab responses, which depended on the the H-2 haplotype of the strain: the B10.A, B10.D2, B10 and B10.BR strains were the highest, high, intermediate and low responders, respectively. In parallel with Ab responses, all the strains were conferred significant protection at any dose of primary immunization. These results indicate that the MHC-restricted responsiveness of mice to HA is different from that to NA, suggesting that the use of high-HA dose or NA as a component of the nasal influenza A (H1N1 subtype) virus vaccine improves the protective efficacy against influenza among low responder populations.",

Since antibodies against HA and neuraminidase (NA) contribute independently to protection against disease, antigenic changes in NA may allow A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses to escape from vaccine-induced immunity. In this study, analysis of the specificities of human NA-specific monoclonal antibodies identified antigenic sites that have changed over time. The impact of these differences on <i>in vitro</i> inhibition of enzyme activity was not evident for polyclonal antisera until viruses emerged in 2013 without a predicted glycosylation site at amino acid 386 in NA. Phylogenetic and antigenic cartography demonstrated significant antigenic changes that in most cases aligned with genetic differences. Typical of NA drift, the antigenic difference is observed in one direction, with antibodies against conserved antigenic domains in A/California/7/2009 (CA/09) continuing to inhibit NA of recent A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reasonably well. However, ferret CA/09-specific antiserum that inhibited the NA of A/Michigan/45/2015 (MI/15) very well <i>in vitro</i>, protected mice against lethal MI/15 infection poorly. These data show that antiserum against the homologous antigen is most effective and suggest the antigenic properties of NA should not be overlooked when selecting viruses for vaccine production.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines against circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has been modest in recent years, despite the absence of antigenic drift of HA, the primary vaccine component. Human monoclonal antibodies identified antigenic sites in NA that changed early after the new pandemic virus emerged. The reactivity of ferret antisera demonstrated antigenic drift of A(H1N1)pdm09 NA from 2013 onward. Passive transfer of serum raised against A/California/7/2009 was less effective than ferret serum against the homologous virus in protecting mice against a virus with the NA of more recent virus, A/Michigan/45/2015. Given the long-standing observation that NA-inhibiting antibodies are associated with resistance against disease in humans, these data demonstrate the importance of evaluating NA drift and suggest that vaccine effectiveness might be improved by selecting viruses for vaccine production that have NAs antigenically similar to those of circulating influenza viruses.",

Each DNA was inoculated twice, 3 weeks apart, or four times, 2 weeks apart, at a dose of 1 microg of each component per mouse by particle-mediated DNA transfer to the epidermis (gene gun). Seven days after the last immunization, mice were challenged with a lethal homologous or heterologous virus and the ability of each DNA to protect the mice from influenza was evaluated by observing lung virus titers and survival rates. The administration of a plasmid DNA mixture of either (HA + NA) or (HA + NA + M1) provided almost complete protection against the PR8 virus challenge, and this protection was accompanied by high levels of specific antibody responses to the respective components. The degree of protection afforded in these groups is significantly higher than that in mice given either HA- or NA-expressing DNA alone, which provided only a partial protection against PR8 challenge or that in mice given M1-expressing DNA, which failed to provide any protection. In addition, both of the plasmid DNA mixtures (HA + NA) and (HA + NA + M1) showed a slight tendency to provide cross-protection against an A/Yamagata/120/86 (H1N1) virus challenge, and this was accompanied by a relatively high level of cross-reacting antibodies. Thus, there was no clear difference between the ability of the HA + NA and HA + NA + M1 plasmid DNA mixtures in providing protection against either a PR8 or heterologous virus challenge. These results suggest that in mice immunized by gene gun, a mixture of plasmid DNAs encoding HA and NA can provide the most effective protection against the virus challenge. The addition of the M -expressing plasmid DNA to this mixture does not enhance the degree of protection afforded.",

In this report, 72 hemagglutinin (HA) and 45 neuraminidase (NA) H1N1 virus gene sequences, isolated in 2009 from various regions of Saudi Arabia, were analyzed. Genetic characterization indicated that viruses from two different clades, 6 and 7, were circulating in the region, with clade 7, the most widely circulating H1N1 clade globally in 2009, being predominant. Sequence analysis of the HA and NA genes revealed a high degree of sequence identity with the corresponding genes from viruses circulating in the South East Asia region and with the A/California/7/2009 strain. New mutations in the HA gene of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) viruses, that could alter viral fitness, were identified.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349854": "Two surface glycoproteins of influenza virus, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), play opposite roles in terms of their interaction with host sialic acid receptors. HA attaches to sialic acid on host cell surface receptors to initiate virus infection while NA removes these sialic acids to facilitate release of progeny virions. This functional opposition requires a balance. To explore what might happen when NA of an influenza virus was replaced by one from another isolate or subtype, in this study, we generated three recombinant influenza A viruses in the background of A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1) and with NA genes obtained respectively from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus, and a lowly pathogenic avian H9N2 virus. These recombinant viruses, rPR8-H1N1NA, rPR8-H5N1NA, and rPR8-H9N2NA, were shown to have similar growth kinetics in cells and pathogenicity in mice. However, much more rPR8-H5N1NA and PR8-wt virions were released from chicken erythrocytes than virions of rPR8-H1N1NA and rPR8-H9N2NA after 1 h. In addition, in MDCK cells, rPR8-H5N1NA and rPR8-H9N2NA infected a higher percentage of cells, and induced cell-cell fusion faster and more extensively than PR8-wt and rPR8-H1N1NA did in the early phase of infection. In conclusion, NA replacement in this study did not affect virus replication kinetics but had different effects on infection initiation, virus release and fusion of infected cells. These phenomena might be partially due to NA proteins' different specificity to \u03b12-3/2-6-sialylated carbohydrate chains, but the exact mechanism remains to be explored.",

However, in recent years, several groups have described point mutations that confer receptor-binding activity on NA, albeit in laboratory rather than natural settings. One of these mutations, D151G, appears to arise in the NA of recent human H3N2 viruses upon passage in tissue culture. We inadvertently isolated the second of these mutations, G147R, in the NA of the lab-adapted A/WSN/33 (H1N1) strain while we were passaging a heavily engineered virus in the lab. G147R also occurs at low frequencies in the reported sequences of viruses from three different lineages: human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1), human seasonal H1N1, and chicken H5N1. Here we reconstructed a representative G147R NA from each of these lineages and found that all of the proteins have acquired the ability to bind an unknown cellular receptor while retaining substantial sialidase activity. We then reconstructed a virus with the HA and NA of a reported G147R pdmH1N1 variant and found no attenuation of viral replication in cell culture or change in pathogenesis in mice. Furthermore, the G147R virus had modestly enhanced resistance to neutralization by the Fab of an antibody against the receptor-binding pocket of HA, although it remained completely sensitive to the full-length IgG. Overall, our results suggest that circulating N1 viruses occasionally may acquire the G147R NA receptor-binding mutation without impairment of replicative capacity. Influenza viruses have two main proteins on their surface: one (hemagglutinin) binds incoming viruses to cells, while the other (neuraminidase) helps release newly formed viruses from these same cells. Here we characterize unusual mutant neuraminidases that have acquired the ability to bind to cells. We show that the mutation that allows neuraminidase to bind cells has no apparent adverse effect on viral replication but does make the virus modestly more resistant to a fragment of an antibody that blocks the normal hemagglutinin-mediated mode of viral attachment. Our results suggest that viruses with receptor-binding neuraminidases may occur at low levels in circulating influenza virus lineages.",

Prior to serological analysis with polyclonal rabbit antisera, HA and NA antigens of four viruses of each subtype were segregated by genetic reassortment to forestall nonspecific steric hindrance during antigen-antibody combination. This analysis has demonstrated that with respect to antigenic phenotype, HA and NA proteins have evolved at different rates. With H1N1 viruses, an arrest of significant evolution of the NA discordant with the continuing antigenic drift of HA was found in the 1980-1983 period. It is probable that the different and independent rates of evolution of HA and NA reflect the greater selective pressure of HA antibodies, which forces the more rapid emergence of HA escape mutants. The slower antigenic change found for NA further supports the potential for NA-specific infection-permissive immunization as a useful stratagem against influenza.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24027333": "In the vast majority of influenza A viruses characterized to date, hemagglutinin (HA) is the receptor-binding and fusion protein, whereas neuraminidase (NA) is a receptor-cleaving protein that facilitates viral release but is expendable for entry. However, the NAs of some recent human H3N2 isolates have acquired receptor-binding activity via the mutation D151G, although these isolates also appear to retain the ability to bind receptors via HA. We report here the laboratory generation of a mutation (G147R) that enables an N1 NA to completely co-opt the receptor-binding function normally performed by HA. Viruses with this mutant NA grow to high titers even in the presence of extensive mutations to conserved residues in HA's receptor-binding pocket. When the receptor-binding NA is paired with this binding-deficient HA, viral infectivity and red blood cell agglutination are blocked by NA inhibitors. Furthermore, virus-like particles expressing only the receptor-binding NA agglutinate red blood cells in an NA-dependent manner. Although the G147R NA receptor-binding mutant virus that we characterize is a laboratory creation, this same mutation is found in several natural clusters of H1N1 and H5N1 viruses. Our results demonstrate that, at least in tissue culture, influenza virus receptor-binding activity can be entirely shifted from HA to NA.",

In the present study, mice were immunized once with 30 microg of NA or HA DNA by electroporation. Four weeks or 28 weeks after immunization, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous virus and the ability of NA or HA DNA to protect the mice from influenza was evaluated. We found that a single inoculation of NA DNA could provide protection against influenza virus challenge as well as long-term protection against viral infection. Whereas, the mice immunized with a single dose of HA DNA could not be protected. In addition, neonatal mice immunized with a single dose of 30 microg of NA DNA could be provided with significant protection against viral infection.",

Here, we report that current influenza vaccines poorly display key NA epitopes and rarely induce NA-reactive B cells. Conversely, influenza virus infection induces NA-reactive B cells at a frequency that approaches (H1N1) or exceeds (H3N2) that of HA-reactive B cells. NA-reactive antibodies display broad binding activity spanning the entire history of influenza A virus circulation in humans, including the original pandemic strains of both H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The antibodies robustly inhibit the enzymatic activity of NA, including oseltamivir-resistant variants, and provide robust prophylactic protection, including against avian H5N1 viruses, in vivo. When used therapeutically, NA-reactive antibodies protected mice from lethal influenza virus challenge even 48 hr post infection.

Previous studies have suggested that Cal-derived chimeric hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) improve virus yields. However, the cell-based vaccine of the H1N1 pandemic virus has been less investigated. RG viruses that contained Cal-derived chimeric HA and NA could be rescued in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that expressed \u03b12,6-sialyltransferase (MDCK-SIAT1). The viral growth kinetics and chimeric HA and NA properties were analyzed. We attempted to generate various RG viruses that contained Cal-derived chimeric HA and NA, but half of them could not be rescued in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. When both the 3'- and 5'-terminal regions of Cal HA viral RNA were replaced with the corresponding regions of PR8 HA, the RG viruses were rescued. Our results were largely consistent with those of previous studies, in which the N- and C-terminal chimeric HA slightly improved virus yield. Importantly, the chimeric HA, compared to Cal HA, showed cell fusion ability at a broader pH range, likely due to amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane region of HA. The rescued RG virus with high virus yield harbored the chimeric HA capable of cell fusion at a broader range of pH.",

The HA protein facilitates the viral binding and entering a host cell and the NA protein helps the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA entail their collaboration, which has important implications for viral replication and fitness. The HA protein from early strains of pandemic 2009 H1N1 of swine origin preferentially binds to human type receptors with a weak binding to avian type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in December 2013 in Texas, USA, which motivated us to investigate the changes of genetic features that might contribute to the surged virulence of the virus. Our time series analysis on the strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that the HA binding preference of this virus in USA, Europe, and Asia has been the characteristic of swine H1N1 virus since 2009. However, its characteristic of seasonal human H1N1 and its binding avidity for avian type receptors both were on steady rise and had a clear increase in 2013 with American strains having the sharpest surge. The first change could enhance the viral transmission and replication in humans and the second could increase its ability to cause infection deep in lungs, which might account for the recent human deaths in Texas. In light of HA and NA coadaptation and evolutionary interactions, we also explored the NA activity of this virus to reveal the functional balance between HA and NA during the course of virus evolution. Finally we identified amino acid substitutions in HA and NA of the virus that were critical for the observed evolution.",

There are two glycoproteins in this lipid membrane; namely, hemagglutinin (HA) which helps in attachment of the viral strain on the host cell surface and neuraminidase (NA) that is responsible for initiation of viral infection. We have developed homology models of both Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase receptors from H1N1 strains in eastern India.

Among progeny displaying microcytic red-cell phenotypes, 7 independent mouse strains harboring mutations within the transferrin receptor gene <i>Tfrc</i> were identified. Six of the mutants, including the previously described red blood cell 6 (RBC6) strain, displayed reduced erythroblast CD71 expression and midgestation lethality of homozygotes (E12.5-E14.5), and 1 novel strain, RBC21, displayed a variable phenotype with sustained CD71 expression and late homozygous lethality (E18.5). Standard iron studies were normal in the RBC21 mutant, but intracellular ferritin was significantly reduced. The microcytic phenotype seen in the RBC21 strain was the result of impaired binding of transferrin to the receptor. Neither RBC6 nor RBC21 responded to iron replacement therapy. These studies describe how point mutations of the transferrin receptor can cause a microcytic anemia that does not respond to iron therapy and would not be detected by routine iron studies, such as serum ferritin.",

At postnatal day (P), 10 and 20 iron-sufficient rat pups were fostered to ID dams to produce a postnatal ID (PNID) group, which was compared to 20 iron-sufficient (IS) pups fostered by IS dams. Pups were assessed from P13 to P15 for hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and Ret-He. Hippocampal iron status was assessed by transferrin receptor-1 (Tfrc-1) and divalent metal transporter-1 (Slc11a2) mRNA expression.

At P14, the PNID group had lower Ret-He, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and reticulocyte percentage (RET%). Tfrc-1 expression was increased, consistent with brain iron deficiency.

The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of <i>Angelica sinensis</i> polysaccharide (ASP) and its underlying mechanism in the treatment of renal anemia. In the present study, we found that ASP could enhance hypoxic induction of EPO in Hep3B cells, with a mechanism that involved the stabilization of HIF-2\u03b1 protein. In parallel, ASP rescued the inhibition of EPO, induced by proinflammatory factor TNF-\u03b1 through blocking GATA2 and NF-\u03baB activation. In a rat model of adenine-induced anemia of CKD, oral administration of ASP corrected anemia and alleviated renal damage and inflammation. By increasing the accumulation of HIF-2\u03b1 protein and reducing the expression of NF-\u03baB and GATA2 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, ASP stimulated both renal and hepatic EPO production, and resulted in an elevation of serum EPO. The restoration of EPO production and EPOR mRNA expression with ASP treatment activated EPOR downstream JAK2/STAT5 and PI3K/Akt signaling, induced their target genes, such as Bcl-xL, Fam132b and Tfrc, and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells of CKD rats. Furthermore, we found that ASP suppressed hepatic hepcidin expression, mobilized iron from spleen and liver and increased serum iron. These findings demonstrate that ASP elicits anti-anemic action by restoring EPO production and improving iron availability in the setting of CKD in rats.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28151426": "Iron availability for erythropoiesis and its dysregulation in \u03b2-thalassemia are incompletely understood. We previously demonstrated that exogenous apotransferrin leads to more effective erythropoiesis, decreasing erythroferrone (ERFE) and derepressing hepcidin in \u03b2-thalassemic mice. Transferrin-bound iron binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is essential for cellular iron delivery during erythropoiesis. We hypothesize that apotransferrin's effect is mediated via decreased TfR1 expression and evaluate TfR1 expression in \u03b2-thalassemic mice in vivo and in vitro with and without added apotransferrin. Our findings demonstrate that \u03b2-thalassemic erythroid precursors overexpress TfR1, an effect that can be reversed by the administration of exogenous apotransferrin. In vitro experiments demonstrate that apotransferrin inhibits TfR1 expression independent of erythropoietin- and iron-related signaling, decreases TfR1 partitioning to reticulocytes during enucleation, and enhances enucleation of defective \u03b2-thalassemic erythroid precursors. These findings strongly suggest that overexpressed TfR1 may play a regulatory role contributing to iron overload and anemia in \u03b2-thalassemic mice. To evaluate further, we crossed TfR1<sup>+/-</sup> mice, themselves exhibiting iron-restricted erythropoiesis with increased hepcidin, with \u03b2-thalassemic mice. Resultant double-heterozygote mice demonstrate long-term improvement in ineffective erythropoiesis, hepcidin derepression, and increased erythroid enucleation in relation to \u03b2-thalassemic mice. Our data demonstrate for the first time that TfR1<sup>+/-</sup> haploinsufficiency reverses iron overload specifically in \u03b2-thalassemic erythroid precursors. Taken together, decreasing TfR1 expression during \u03b2-thalassemic erythropoiesis, either directly via induced haploinsufficiency or via exogenous apotransferrin, decreases ineffective erythropoiesis and provides an endogenous mechanism to upregulate hepcidin, leading to sustained iron-restricted erythropoiesis and preventing systemic iron overload in \u03b2-thalassemic mice.",

Recently, it has been demonstrated that TfR1 could also have signaling functions in erythroid cells. Moreover, the second transferrin receptor, TfR2, whose signaling functions in hepatic cells are well established, was recently shown to be a partner of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and thereby likely to play a role in erythroid differentiation. This review reports recent findings regarding the specificities of the regulation of TfR1 expression and iron uptake in erythroblasts. The newly discovered noncanonical actions of TfR1 and TfR2 in erythroid cells are also discussed. Erythrocytes contain more than 60% of the iron of the body and each day, differentiating erythroid cells uptake around 20 mg of iron for heme synthesis. Accordingly, TfR1 is one of the most abundant membrane proteins of the erythroblasts and it is not surprising that specific regulations regarding both its expression and its mechanism of action operate in erythroblasts. The signaling functions of both TfR1 and TfR2 in erythroid cells were unexpected and these recent findings open a new field of research regarding the last steps of erythroid differentiation and their regulation.",

Bone marrow erythroblasts incorporate Tf through endocytosis, which is mediated by transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). Recently, human TFR1, aside from its role as a Tf receptor, was also found to be a receptor for the H-subunit of ferritin (FTH). In humans, hematopoietic erythroid precursor cells express high levels of TFR1 and specifically take up the FTH homopolymer (H-ferritin). H-ferritin inhibits the formation of burst forming unit-erythroid colonies in vitro. TFR2, which is also a Tf receptor, is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and erythroid precursor cells. In the liver, TFR2 forms a complex with HFE, a hereditary hemochromatosis-associated protein, and acts as an iron sensor. In mice, hepatocyte-specific knockout of the TFR2 gene has been shown to cause systemic iron-overload with decreased expression of hepcidin, the central regulator of iron homeostasis. In erythroid cells, TFR2 forms a complex with the erythropoietin receptor and facilitates its trafficking to the cell membrane. Moreover, hematopoietic cell-specific knockout of the TFR2 gene causes microcytic erythrocytosis in mice. This review focuses on the molecular evolution and functions of these TFRs and their ligands.",

The excess unmatched alpha-globin chains accumulate in the growing erythroid precursors, causing their premature death (ineffective erythropoiesis). Clinical features of beta-thalassemia include variably severe anemia and iron accumulation due to increased intestinal iron absorption. The most anemic patients require regular blood transfusions, which exacerbate their iron overload and result in damage to vital organs. The hepatic peptide hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism in mammals, was recently found to be low in the urine of beta-thalassemia patients, compared with healthy controls, despite their iron overload. In our work, we measured by RQ-PCR the liver mRNA expression of hepcidin and other iron regulatory genes in beta-thalassemia major mouse model (C57Bl/6 Hbb(th3/th3)), and compared it with beta-thalassemia intermedia mouse model (C57Bl/6 Hbb(th3/+)) and control mice. We found decreased expression of hepcidin and TfR2 and increased expression of TfR1 and NGAL in the beta-thalassemia mouse models, compared with the control mice.

Iron absorption, serum iron levels and hepcidin expression were then measured. The hydrodynamic gene transfer technique proved to be an effective approach to achieving sustained expression of sTfR1 in mice. Although expression of high levels of sTfR1 significantly increased serum iron levels, repeated experiments showed that neither hsTfR1 nor msTfR1 had any effect on iron absorption or hepcidin mRNA expression levels.

We introduced mutations into a ubiquitously expressed Tfr1 transgene or the endogenous Tfr1 locus to promote or prevent the Hfe/Tfr1 interaction. Under conditions favoring a constitutive Hfe/Tfr1 interaction, mice developed iron overload attributable to inappropriately low expression of the hormone hepcidin. In contrast, mice carrying a mutation that interferes with the Hfe/Tfr1 interaction developed iron deficiency associated with inappropriately high hepcidin expression. High-level expression of a liver-specific Hfe transgene in Hfe-/- mice was also associated with increased hepcidin production and iron deficiency.

Snx3 is highly expressed in vertebrate hematopoietic tissues. Silencing of Snx3 results in anemia and hemoglobin defects in vertebrates due to impaired transferrin (Tf)-mediated iron uptake and its accumulation in early endosomes. This impaired iron assimilation can be complemented with non-Tf iron chelates. We show that Snx3 and Vps35, a component of the retromer, interact with Tfrc to sort it to the recycling endosomes.

The purpose of this study was to find out whether LES could be equally applied to evaluate joint function in patients with elbow stiffness. A total of 63 patients with elbow stiffness were included in this retrospective validation study. The LES combines a nine-item patient-answered questionnaire (PAQ) and a six-item clinical assessment score (CAS), and can also be divided to evaluate two different parameters: elbow motion capacity (EMC) and elbow-related symptoms (ERS). Construct validity was assessed by correlating LES with previously validated scoring systems, and Spearman correlation coefficients (SCCs) were calculated. Effect size (ES) and standardized response mean (SRM) were calculated to determine responsiveness. There were no ceiling or floor effects in the target population. Good-to-excellent validity was determined based on total score (0.45-0.89), PAQ (0.42-0.88), CAS (0.35-0.60), EMC (0.46-0.86), and ERS (0.36-0.59).

The study included a total of 100 Discovery Elbows (April 2003 to January 2010) with a minimum 2-year follow-up, including 75 primary and 25 revisions (60% women and 40% men; mean age, 62 years). Outcome was assessed by means of the Liverpool Elbow Score, pain experience, patient satisfaction, range of motion, and radiographic imaging. The mean follow-up period was 48.5 months (range, 24-108 months). The Liverpool Elbow Score improved from 3.79 to 6.36 (P &lt; .001). The percentage of pain-free patients was substantially increased from 7% preoperatively to 64% at the final follow-up. The patient satisfaction rate was over 90%. The flexion-extension arc and pronation-supination arc increased from 72\u00b0 to 93\u00b0 and from 86\u00b0 to 111\u00b0, respectively (P &lt; .001). Major postoperative complications included deep infection (2%), progressive aseptic loosening requiring revision (primary, 5%; revision 12%), persistent ulnar neuropathy (3%), and periprosthetic fracture (primary, 6.8%; revision, 8%). The Discovery Elbow System resulted in improved function, reduced pain, and high patient satisfaction. Long-term results are required to assess the survivorship of this system.",

A prospective randomised study on the surgical treatment of humeral diaphyseal fractures was carried out between September 2009 and January 2013. The patients indicated for surgical treatment fell into two groups according to the technique used as follows: minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) with a locking compression plate (LCP; Synthes, Switzerland); depending on the fracture type and course of fracture line, either a straight narrow or a Philos or a metaphyseal LCP was used (group 1); and intramedullary nailing (EHN, Synthes, Switzerland) (group 2). A total of 49 patients were entered into the study. The men-to-women ratio was about 1:1 and the average age was 52 years (18 to 83). Of them, 45 patients with 46 humeral fractures were followed up and evaluated. The injury was caused by a fall from standing or while walking (n=21), traffic accident (n=16), sports activity (n=3) or work-related activity (n=5). A single injury was treated in 72% and multiple trauma in 28% of the patients. Using the AO classification, fractures were diagnosed as types A, B and C in 25, 10 and 11 patients, respectively. The patients were randomised into the groups using a computer programme allowing for the maintenance of group homogeneity. Each patient received information on the method to be used in a sealed envelope. The average injury-surgery interval was 6 days (range, 0 to 26). The average operative time was 128 minutes (80 to 200). The average intra-operative exposure to X-ray was 8 minutes (3 to 20). The average hospital stay was 20 days (4 to 100) The average rehabilitation time till functional recovery was 17 weeks (3 to 37), the time of bone union by radiographic assessment was 20 weeks (12 to 40). The functional outcome was assessed using the Constant-Murley (CM) and Liverpool Elbow Score (LES) systems. The relative CM/LES score, as compared with the healthy extremity, was 95/100. Excellent and good results were achieved in 89% and complications were recorded in 26% of the patients. The most frequent complication was impingement syndrome or prolonged rehabilitation both in the patients with proximal humerus fractures managed with the Philos locking plate and in those treated by intramedullary nailing, although this was not necessarily due to a technical error, i.e., osteosynthetic material protrusion. Iatrogenic radial nerve injury was found only in one patient treated by intramedullary nailing and was associated with traction during reduction and nail insertion. Pseudoarthrosis was recorded in one patient of each group and there were no infectious complications. Intramedullary nailing has not yet shown such good outcomes in humeral as in tibial fractures. The results of metaanalysis have indicated that humeral fractures treated by plate osteosynthesis have fewer complications and require repeat surgery less frequently. However, as shown by most recent studies, this difference is getting smaller. The MIPO technique was adopted at our department several years ago and the aim was to compare our results with those of other centres. The studies so far published have show that MIPO and conventional open plate osteosynthesis give comparable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The statistical evaluation using the unpaired t-test did not show any significant differences in either the functional results or the number of complications between the two methods. Both achieved about 90% of excellent and good results and had 26% of complications. The only significant difference was found in the length of operative time (136 min in MIPO versus 117 min in EHN). With use of the Chi-Square test, a significant correlation between AO fracture type and treatment outcome in the MIPO group was found, i.e., no poor result was recorded for type A fractures, as assessed by the CM/LES score. No such correlation between the fracture type and the functional outcome was seen in the EHN group.",

The aim of this prospective observational study was to assess these parameters for the Liverpool Elbow Score (LES) in total elbow replacement (TER). The study included 121 cemented TER cases with linked elbow prosthesis (Discovery Elbow, Biomet Orthopaedics, Swindon, UK) for various conditions, including inflammatory arthritis, noninflammatory arthritis, trauma, and loosening. The proportion of patients with the lowest score (0 points; floor effect) and maximum score (10 points; ceiling effect) was checked preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Distribution-based methods (effect size [ES], standardized response mean [SRM], Guyatt responsiveness ratio [GRR]) and anchor-based methods (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve and Spearman correlation coefficient) were used to assess responsiveness. Patient satisfaction after TER was used as an external anchor. Patients were a mean age of 63 years (range, 20-86 years). Large ES (1.64), SRM (1.25), and GRR (1.69) were found during the follow-up period. Area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.87; P = .03). There was significant positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.35; P = .004) between changes in LES and satisfaction level. LES showed no floor and ceiling effect preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively. LES is a responsive measure and has no floor and ceiling effect.

Osteosynthesis of the fracture fragment or correction of elbow deformity with osteotomies and ulnar nerve transposition or sometimes both procedures combined is a controversial topic. We retrospectively evaluated open reduction and fixation cases in late presentation of lateral humeral condyle fracture in pediatric cases with regards to union and functional results. Twenty two pediatric (\u226412 years) patients with fractures of lateral condyle presenting 4 weeks or more post injury between the study period of 2006 and 2010 were included. Multiple K-wires / with or without screws along with bone grafting were used. At final evaluation, union (radiologically) and elbow function (Liverpool Elbow Score, LES) was assessed. There were 19 boys and 3 girls. Followup averaged 33 months. Pain (n=9), swelling (n=6), restriction of elbow motion (n=6), prominence of lateral condylar region (n=4), valgus deformity (n=4) were the main presenting symptoms. Ulnar nerve function was normal in all patients. There were nine Milch type I and 13 type II fractures. Union occurred in 20 cases. One case had malunion and in another case there was resorption of condyle following postoperative infection and avascular necrosis. Prominent lateral condyles (4/12), fish tail appearance (n=7), premature epiphyseal closure (n=2) were other observations. LES averaged 8.12 (range, 6.66-9.54) at final followup. There is high rate of union and satisfactory elbow function in late presenting lateral condyle fractures in children following osteosynthesis attempt. Our study showed poor correlation between patient's age, duration of late presentation or Milch type I or II and final elbow function as determined by LES.",

Healing of this lesion is reported with the use of autologous blood as well as with platelet-rich plasma (PRP). A comparative study of these 2 treatments was conducted in an effort to investigate the possible advantages of PRP. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Twenty-eight patients were divided equally into 2 groups, after blocked randomization. Group A was treated with a single injection of 3 mL of autologous blood and group B with 3 mL of PRP under ultrasound guidance. A standardized program of eccentric muscle strengthening was followed by all patients in both groups. Evaluation using a pain visual analog scale (VAS) and Liverpool elbow score was performed at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The VAS score improvement was larger in group B at every follow-up interval but the difference was statistically significant only at 6 weeks, when mean improvement was 3.8 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1-4.5) in group B (61.47% improvement) and 2.5 points (95% CI, 1.9-3.1) in group A (41.6% improvement) (P &lt; .05). No statistically significant difference was noted between groups regarding Liverpool elbow score. Regarding pain reduction, PRP treatment seems to be an effective treatment for chronic lateral elbow epicondylitis and superior to autologous blood in the short term. Defining details of indications, best PRP concentration, number and time of injections, as well as rehabilitation protocol might increase the method's effectiveness. Additionally, the possibility of cost reduction of the method might justify the use of PRP over autologous whole blood for chronic or refractory tennis elbow.",

Records of 7 men and 3 women aged 33 to 73 years who underwent plate osteosynthesis for severe olecranon fractures were reviewed. All had some degree of soft-tissue injury; 6 presented with associated fractures. Seven patients were treated with a limited contact dynamic compression plate, and the remaining 3 received a locking compression plate. Patients were followed up for fracture healing, range of motion, nerve damage, heterotopic ossification, infection, hardware complaints, and the need of a secondary surgical procedure. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was determined at the final follow-up. The patient-answered questionnaire (PAQ) portion of the Liverpool Elbow Score (LES) was evaluated 2 to 37 months later by telephone. All patients had bone union. None had nerve damage or heterotopic ossification. Patients 4, 6, and 8 with type-IIIB fractures developed deep infections and severe soft-tissue swelling; all had been treated with the limited contact dynamic compression plate. Four patients underwent plate removal owing to hardware complaints. One patient underwent a secondary procedure to restore complete range of elbow motion. The mean MEPS score was 84 (range, 35-100); 5 patients attained excellent scores, one good, 2 satisfactory, and 2 unsatisfactory. The mean PAQ portion of the LES score was 31 (range, 23-36).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19380130": " The treatment of fractures of the distal humerus is difficult and involves the risk of bad functional results, particularly with articular fractures or impaired bone quality. Anatomical reconstruction and stable fixation allowing early mobilisation of the elbow are the basic prerequisites for good clinical outcomes. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the Distal Humerus Plate (DHP, Synthes), a novel, perpendicular, fixed-angle plate system, fulfils the requirements for this treatment goal. From 2004 to 2007, 46 consecutive patients (19 men and 21 women; mean age of 60.5 years) underwent open reduction and internal fixation with the new DHP system. Six patients were lost to follow up. The remaining 40 patients were followed up for 11 months (range 4-24 months). Follow up involved assessment of functional outcome using the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and Liverpool Elbow Score (LES), reduction results and complication rates. Subgroup analyses involved comparisons of younger (&lt;60 years) to elderly (&gt; or =60 years) patients and type C3 injuries versus other fracture patterns. Only six cases received primary internal fixation, whilst 31 patients were temporarily stabilised by either external fixation or cast before ORIF could be performed. Three patients were treated for implant failure (systems other than DHP) after surgery in other hospitals. The mean time from injury to internal fixation was 7 days. Open fractures were present in 10 cases. Olecranon osteotomy was required for reduction in 35 cases. Mean operation time was 215 min. 'Good' or 'excellent' results were observed in 29/40 patients. Median MEPS and LES were 84 and 8.1 points, respectively. Mean ROM was 100 degrees. We found no significant differences in the subgroup analyses; however, there was a tendency towards better functional results in younger patients and injuries without comminution of the articular surface. Complications comprised two superficial wound infections, two cases of heterotopic ossification, one case of delayed union and five cases of transient ulnar neuropathy. Implant failure was observed twice in one patient. Open reduction and internal fixation with the DHP system provides reliable, stable fixation allowing early functional mobilisation of the elbow joint, even in complex fractures and impaired bone quality, resulting in good outcomes for the majority of patients. The complication rate reported here is comparable to that of other implants, but the low number of implant failures is promising and warrants further investigation.",

Extensively established key effectors of such apoptotic bypass mechanisms, the antiapoptotic BCL-2 (apoptosis regulator BCL-2) proteins, determine the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. Within this background, research and development of antiapoptotic BCL-2 inhibitors were considered to have a tremendous amount of potential toward the discovery of novel pharmacological modulators in cancer. In this review, milestone achievements in the development of selective antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins inhibitors for BCL-2, BCL-XL (BCL-2-like protein 1), and MCL-1 (induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein MCL-1) were summarized and their future implications were discussed. In the first section, the design and development of BCL-2/BCL-XL dual inhibitor navitoclax, as well as the recent advances and clinical experience with selective BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, were synopsized. Preclinical data from selective BCL-XL inhibitors, which are currently undergoing extensive testing as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents, were further summarized. In the second section, MCL-1 inhibitors developed as potential anticancer agents were reviewed regarding their specificity toward MCL-1. Explicitly, studies leading to the identification of MCL-1, nonselective and selective targeting of MCL-1, and recently initiated clinical trials were compiled in chronological order.

Treatment with Lico-E exhibited significant cytotoxicity on FaDu cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of Lico-E in FaDu cells was ~50 \u00b5M. Treatment with Lico-E increased the number of dead FaDu cells. Furthermore, chromatin condensation, which is associated with apoptotic cell death, was observed in FaDu cells treated with Lico-E for 24 h. By contrast, Lico-E did not produce cytotoxicity or increase the number of dead cells when applied to human normal oral keratinocytes (hNOKs). Furthermore, chromatin condensation was not observed in hNOKs treated with Lico-E. Treatment with Lico-E increased the expression of Fas ligand and the cleaved form of caspase-8 in FaDu cells. Furthermore, treatment with Lico-E increased the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, including apoptosis regulator BAX, Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1, caspase-9 and tumor suppressor p53, while decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic factors, including apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-like protein 1 in FaDu cells. The expression of cleaved caspases-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase was significantly upregulated following treatment with Lico-E in FaDu cells, while Lico-E-induced apoptotic FaDu cell death was partially suppressed by treatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan caspase inhibitor. Therefore, Lico-E-induced oral cancer (OC) cell-specific apoptosis is mediated by the death receptor-dependent extrinsic and mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways. In conclusion, these data suggested that Lico-E exhibits potential chemopreventive effects and warrants further developed as a chemotherapeutic agent against OC.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045046": "Breast cancer is the second-most frequently diagnosed malignancy in US women. The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype, which lacks expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, afflicts 15% of patients and is refractory to current targeted therapies. Like many cancers, TNBC cells often deregulate programmed cell death by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family. One family member, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), is commonly amplified in TNBC and correlates with a poor clinical prognosis. Here we show the effect of silencing Mcl-1 and Bcl-2-like protein 1 isoform 1 (Bcl-xL) expression on viability in a panel of seventeen TNBC cell lines. Cell death was observed in a subset upon Mcl-1 knockdown. In contrast, Bcl-xL knockdown only modestly reduced viability, indicating that Mcl-1 is a more important survival factor. However, dual silencing of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL reduced viability in most cell lines tested. These proliferation results were recapitulated by BH3 profiling experiments. Treatment with a Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 peptide had only a moderate effect on any of the TNBC cell lines, however, co-dosing an Mcl-1-selective peptide with a peptide that inhibits Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 was effective in each line tested. Similarly, the selective Bcl-xL inhibitor WEHI-539 was only weakly cytotoxic across the panel, but sensitization by Mcl-1 knockdown markedly improved its EC50. ABT-199, which selectively inhibits Bcl-2, did not synergize with Mcl-1 knockdown, indicating the relatively low importance of Bcl-2 in these lines. Mcl-1 sensitivity is not predicted by mRNA or protein levels of a single Bcl-2 family member, except for only a weak correlation for Bak and Bax protein expression. However, a more comprehensive index composed of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Bim, Bak and Noxa protein or mRNA expression correlates well with Mcl-1 sensitivity in TNBC and can also predict Mcl-1 dependency in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.",

Myocilin is a secreted protein with relatively ill-defined matricellular properties. Despite its high expression in the eye, myocilin-deficient mice have originally been reported to have no obvious ocular phenotype. Here we revisited the ocular phenotype of myocilin-deficient mice and detected a higher number of neurons in their inner (INL) and outer (ONL) nuclear layers, as well as a higher number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons. The increase in retinal neurons appears to be caused by a decrease in programmed developmental cell death, as apoptosis of retinal neurons between postnatal days 4 and 10 was found to be attenuated when compared to that of wildtype littermates. In contrast, when Myoc(-/-) mice were crossed with \u03b2B1-crystallin-MYOC mice with ectopic overexpression of myocilin in the eye, no differences in developmental apoptosis, RGC number and INL thickness were observed when compared to wildtype littermates. The amounts of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein 1 (BCL2L1, Bcl-xL) and its mRNA were increased in retinae of Myoc(-/-) mice, while lower amounts of BCL2L1 and its mRNA were detected in mixed Myoc(-/-)/\u03b2B1-crystallin-MYOC mice. The structural differences between Myoc(-/-) mice and wildtype littermates did not result in functional differences as measured by electroretinography. Noteworthy though mixed Myoc(-/-)/\u03b2B1-crystallin-MYOC mice with ocular overexpression of myocilin had significant cone function deficits.

Particularly, obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin, a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue, and attenuates obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing M2 macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus, this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18931655": "In all animals, the initial events of embryogenesis are controlled by maternal gene products that are deposited into the developing oocyte. At some point after fertilization, control of embryogenesis is transferred to the zygotic genome in a process called the maternal-to-zygotic transition. During this time, many maternal RNAs are degraded and transcription of zygotic RNAs ensues. There is a long-standing question as to which factors regulate these events. The recent findings that microRNAs and Smaug mediate maternal transcript degradation have shed new light on this aspect of the problem. However, the transcription factor(s) that activate the zygotic genome remain elusive. The discovery that many of the early transcribed genes in Drosophila share a cis-regulatory heptamer motif, CAGGTAG and related sequences, collectively referred to as TAGteam sites raised the possibility that a dedicated transcription factor could interact with these sites to activate transcription. Here we report that the zinc-finger protein Zelda (Zld; Zinc-finger early Drosophila activator) binds specifically to these sites and is capable of activating transcription in transient transfection assays. Mutant embryos lacking zld are defective in cellular blastoderm formation, and fail to activate many genes essential for cellularization, sex determination and pattern formation. Global expression profiling confirmed that Zld has an important role in the activation of the early zygotic genome and suggests that Zld may also regulate maternal RNA degradation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599892": "Maternally contributed mRNAs and proteins control the initial stages of development following fertilization. During this time, most of the zygotic genome remains transcriptionally silent. The initiation of widespread zygotic transcription is coordinated with the degradation of maternally provided mRNAs at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). While most of the genome is silenced prior to the MZT, a small subset of zygotic genes essential for the future development of the organism is transcribed. Previous work in our laboratory and others identified the TAGteam element, a set of related heptameric DNA-sequences in the promoters of many early-expressed Drosophila genes required to drive their unusually early transcription. To understand how this unique subset of genes is regulated, we identified a TAGteam-binding factor Grainyhead (Grh). We demonstrated that Grh and the previously characterized transcriptional activator Zelda (Zld) bind to different TAGteam sequences with varying affinities, and that Grh competes with Zld for TAGteam occupancy. Moreover, overexpression of Grh in the early embryo causes defects in cell division, phenocopying Zld depletion. Our findings indicate that during early embryonic development the precise timing of gene expression is regulated by both the sequence of the TAGteam elements in the promoter and the relative levels of the transcription factors Grh and Zld.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22028675": "In past years, much attention has focused on the gene networks that regulate early developmental processes, but less attention has been paid to how multiple networks and processes are temporally coordinated. Recently the discovery of the transcriptional activator Zelda (Zld), which binds to CAGGTAG and related sequences present in the enhancers of many early-activated genes in Drosophila, hinted at a mechanism for how batteries of genes could be simultaneously activated. Here we use genome-wide binding and expression assays to identify Zld target genes in the early embryo with the goal of unraveling the gene circuitry regulated by Zld. We found that Zld binds to genes involved in early developmental processes such as cellularization, sex determination, neurogenesis, and pattern formation. In the absence of Zld, many target genes failed to be activated, while others, particularly the patterning genes, exhibited delayed transcriptional activation, some of which also showed weak and/or sporadic expression. These effects disrupted the normal sequence of patterning-gene interactions and resulted in highly altered spatial expression patterns, demonstrating the significance of a timing mechanism in early development. In addition, we observed prevalent overlap between Zld-bound regions and genomic \"hotspot\" regions, which are bound by many developmental transcription factors, especially the patterning factors. This, along with the finding that the most over-represented motif in hotspots, CAGGTA, is the Zld binding site, implicates Zld in promoting hotspot formation. We propose that Zld promotes timely and robust transcriptional activation of early-gene networks so that developmental events are coordinated and cell fates are established properly in the cellular blastoderm embryo.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22028662": "The earliest stages of development in most metazoans are driven by maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs, with widespread transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome occurring hours after fertilization, at a period known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In Drosophila, the MZT is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes; and the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in their transcriptional activation. To better understand the mechanisms of ZLD activation and the range of its targets, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD before (mitotic cycle 8), during (mitotic cycle 13), and after (late mitotic cycle 14) the MZT. Although only a handful of genes are transcribed prior to mitotic cycle 10, we identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. As expected, early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage. However, we also observed ZLD bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT and to virtually all of the thousands of known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is so strong that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This strong early association of ZLD with regions not active until the MZT suggests that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537497": "The Drosophila Zelda transcription factor plays an important role in regulating transcription at the embryonic maternal-to-zygotic transition. However, expression of zelda continues throughout embryogenesis in cells including the developing CNS and trachea, but little is known about its post-blastoderm functions. In this paper, it is shown that zelda directly controls CNS midline and tracheal expression of the link (CG13333) gene, as well as link blastoderm expression. The link gene contains a 5' enhancer with multiple Zelda TAGteam binding sites that in vivo mutational studies show are required for link transcription. The link enhancer also has a binding site for the Single-minded:Tango and Trachealess:Tango bHLH-PAS proteins that also influences link midline and tracheal expression. These results provide an example of how a transcription factor (Single-minded or Trachealess) can interact with distinct co-regulatory proteins (Zelda or Sox/POU-homeodomain proteins) to control a similar pattern of expression of different target genes in a mechanistically different manner. While zelda and single-minded midline expression is well-conserved in Drosophila, midline expression of link is not well-conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of link expression suggests that ~60 million years ago, midline expression was nearly or completely absent, and first appeared in the melanogaster group (including D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, and D. erecta) &gt;13 million years ago. The differences in expression are due, in part, to sequence polymorphisms in the link enhancer and likely due to altered binding of multiple transcription factors. Less than 6 million years ago, a second change occurred that resulted in high levels of expression in D. melanogaster. This change may be due to alterations in a putative Zelda binding site. Within the CNS, the zelda gene is alternatively spliced beginning at mid-embryogenesis into transcripts that encode a Zelda isoform missing three zinc fingers from the DNA binding domain. This may result in a protein with altered, possibly non-functional, DNA-binding properties. In summary, Zelda collaborates with bHLH-PAS proteins to directly regulate midline and tracheal expression of an evolutionary dynamic enhancer in the post-blastoderm embryo.",

However, the impact of enhancer priming by pioneer factors on the temporal control of gene expression and on mitotic memory remains unclear. Here we employ quantitative live imaging methods and mathematical modeling to test the effect of the pioneer factor Zelda on transcriptional dynamics and memory in Drosophila embryos. We demonstrate that increasing the number of Zelda binding sites accelerates the kinetics of nuclei transcriptional activation regardless of their transcriptional past. Despite its known pioneering activities, we show that Zelda does not remain detectably associated with mitotic chromosomes and is neither necessary nor sufficient to foster memory. We further reveal that Zelda forms sub-nuclear dynamic hubs where Zelda binding events are transient. We propose that Zelda facilitates transcriptional activation by accumulating in microenvironments where it could accelerate the duration of multiple pre-initiation steps.",

The zinc-finger TF zelda (zld) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand cis-regulatory modules to regulate chromatin accessibility. D. melanogaster displays a long germ type of embryonic development, where all segments are simultaneously generated along the whole egg. However, it remains unclear if zld is also involved in the MZT of short-germ insects (including those from basal lineages) or in other biological processes. Here we show that zld is an innovation of the Pancrustacea lineage, being absent in more distant arthropods (e.g. chelicerates) and other organisms. To better understand zld\u00b4s ancestral function, we thoroughly investigated its roles in a short-germ beetle, Tribolium castaneum, using molecular biology and computational approaches. Our results demonstrate roles for zld not only during the MZT, but also in posterior segmentation and patterning of imaginal disc derived structures. Further, we also demonstrate that zld is critical for posterior segmentation in the hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus, indicating this function predates the origin of holometabolous insects and was subsequently lost in long-germ insects. Our results unveil new roles of zld in different biological contexts and suggest that changes in expression of zld (and probably other major TFs) are critical in the evolution of insect GRNs.",

Recently, we showed that Zelda acts through specific chromatin patterns of histone modifications to mark developmental enhancers and active promoters. Intriguingly, some Zelda sites still maintain these chromatin patterns in Drosophila embryos lacking maternal Zelda protein. This suggests that additional Zelda-like pioneer factors may act in early fly embryos. We developed a computational method to analyze and refine the chromatin landscape surrounding early Zelda peaks, using a multichannel spectral clustering. This allowed us to characterize their chromatin patterns through MZT (mitotic cycles 8-14). Specifically, we focused on H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K18ac, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 and identified three different classes of chromatin signatures, matching \"promoters,\" \"enhancers\" and \"transiently bound\" Zelda peaks. We then further scanned the genome using these chromatin patterns and identified additional loci-with no Zelda binding-that show similar chromatin patterns, resulting with hundreds of Zelda-independent putative enhancers. These regions were found to be enriched with GAGA factor (GAF, Trl) and are typically located near early developmental zygotic genes. Overall our analysis suggests that GAF, together with Zelda, plays an important role in activating the zygotic genome. As we show, our computational approach offers an efficient algorithm for characterizing chromatin signatures around some loci of interest and allows a genome-wide identification of additional loci with similar chromatin patterns.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29261646": "In nearly all metazoans, the earliest stages of development are controlled by maternally deposited mRNAs and proteins. The zygotic genome becomes transcriptionally active hours after fertilization. Transcriptional activation during this maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is tightly coordinated with the degradation of maternally provided mRNAs. In Drosophila melanogaster, the transcription factor Zelda plays an essential role in widespread activation of the zygotic genome. While Zelda expression is required both maternally and zygotically, the mechanisms by which it functions to remodel the embryonic genome and prepare the embryo for development remain unclear. Using Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate targeted mutations in the endogenous zelda locus, we determined the functional relevance of protein domains conserved amongst Zelda orthologs. We showed that neither a conserved N-terminal zinc finger nor an acidic patch were required for activity. Similarly, a previously identified splice isoform of zelda is dispensable for viability. By contrast, we identified a highly conserved zinc-finger domain that is essential for the maternal, but not zygotic functions of Zelda. Animals homozygous for mutations in this domain survived to adulthood, but embryos inheriting these loss-of-function alleles from their mothers died late in embryogenesis. These mutations did not interfere with the capacity of Zelda to activate transcription in cell culture. Unexpectedly, these mutations generated a hyperactive form of the protein and enhanced Zelda-dependent gene expression. These data have defined a protein domain critical for controlling Zelda activity during the MZT, but dispensable for its roles later in development, for the first time separating the maternal and zygotic requirements for Zelda. This demonstrates that highly regulated levels of Zelda activity are required for establishing the developmental program during the MZT. We propose that tightly regulated gene expression is essential to navigate the MZT and that failure to precisely execute this developmental program leads to embryonic lethality.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26335633": "The Drosophila genome activator Vielfaltig (Vfl), also known as Zelda (Zld), is thought to prime enhancers for activation by patterning transcription factors (TFs). Such priming is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl). Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs. Without Zld, Dl binding decreases at enhancers and redistributes to open regions devoid of enhancer activity. We propose that Zld primes enhancers by lowering the high nucleosome barrier just enough to assist TFs in accessing their binding motifs and promoting spatially controlled enhancer activation if the right patterning TFs are present. We envision that genome activators in general will utilize this mechanism to activate the zygotic genome in a robust and precise manner.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26335634": "The transition from a specified germ cell to a population of pluripotent cells occurs rapidly following fertilization. During this developmental transition, the zygotic genome is largely transcriptionally quiescent and undergoes significant chromatin remodeling. In Drosophila, the DNA-binding protein Zelda (also known as Vielfaltig) is required for this transition and for transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. Open chromatin is associated with Zelda-bound loci, as well as more generally with regions of active transcription. Nonetheless, the extent to which Zelda influences chromatin accessibility across the genome is largely unknown. Here we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements to determine the role of Zelda in regulating regions of open chromatin in the early embryo. We demonstrate that Zelda is essential for hundreds of regions of open chromatin. This Zelda-mediated chromatin accessibility facilitates transcription-factor recruitment and early gene expression. Thus, Zelda possesses some key characteristics of a pioneer factor. Unexpectedly, chromatin at a large subset of Zelda-bound regions remains open even in the absence of Zelda. The GAGA factor-binding motif and embryonic GAGA factor binding are specifically enriched in these regions. We propose that both Zelda and GAGA factor function to specify sites of open chromatin and together facilitate the remodeling of the early embryonic genome.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25538246": "Delayed transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome is a nearly universal phenomenon in metazoans. Immediately following fertilization, development is controlled by maternally deposited products, and it is not until later stages that widespread activation of the zygotic genome occurs. Although the mechanisms driving this genome activation are currently unknown, the transcriptional activator Zelda (ZLD) has been shown to be instrumental in driving this process in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we define functional domains of ZLD required for both DNA binding and transcriptional activation. We show that the C-terminal cluster of four zinc fingers mediates binding to TAGteam DNA elements in the promoters of early expressed genes. All four zinc fingers are required for this activity, and splice isoforms lacking three of the four zinc fingers fail to activate transcription. These truncated splice isoforms dominantly suppress activation by the full-length, embryonically expressed isoform. We map the transcriptional activation domain of ZLD to a central region characterized by low complexity. Despite relatively little sequence conservation within this domain, ZLD orthologs from Drosophila virilis, Anopheles gambiae, and Nasonia vitripennis activate transcription in D. melanogaster cells. Transcriptional activation by these ZLD orthologs suggests that ZLD functions through conserved interactions with a protein cofactor(s). We have identified distinct DNA-binding and activation domains within the critical transcription factor ZLD that controls the initial activation of the zygotic genome.",

Experiments in Drosophila and zebrafish have revealed that ZGA depends on transcription factors that provide large-scale control of gene expression by direct and specific binding to gene regulatory sequences. Zelda (Zld) plays such a role in the Drosophila embryo, where it has been shown to control the action of patterning signals; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unclear. A recent model proposed that Zld binding sites act as quantitative regulators of the spatiotemporal expression of genes activated by Dorsal (Dl), the morphogen that patterns the dorsoventral axis. Here we tested this model experimentally, using enhancers of brinker (brk) and short gastrulation (sog), both of which are directly activated by Dl, but at different concentration thresholds. In agreement with the model, we show that there is a clear positive correlation between the number of Zld binding sites and the spatial domain of enhancer activity. Likewise, the timing of expression could be advanced or delayed. We present evidence that Zld facilitates binding of Dl to regulatory DNA, and that this is associated with increased chromatin accessibility. Importantly, the change in chromatin accessibility is strongly correlated with the change in Zld binding, but not Dl. We propose that the ability of genome activators to facilitate readout of transcriptional input is key to widespread transcriptional induction during ZGA.",

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this event are being clarified in Drosophila melanogaster, little is know about the embryogenic processes in other insect species. The recent publication of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from embryos of the global pest species Ceratitis capitata (medfly) has enabled the investigation of embryogenesis in this species and has allowed a comparison of the embryogenic processes in these two related dipteran species, C. capitata and D. melanogaster, that shared a common ancestor 80-100 mya. Using a novel PCR-based sexing method, which takes advantage of a putative LTR retrotransposon MITE insertion on the medfly Y chromosome, the transcriptomes of individual early male and female embryos were analysed using RT-PCR. This study is focused on two crucial aspects of the onset of embryonic development: sex determination and cellular blastoderm formation. Together with the three known medfly genes (Cctransformer, Cctransformer2 and Ccdoublesex), the expression patterns of other medfly genes that are similar to the D. melanogaster sex-determination genes (sisterlessA, groucho, deadpan, Sex-lethal, female lethal d, sans fille and intersex) and four cellular blastoderm formation genes (Rho1, spaghetti squash, slow-as-molasses and serendipity-alpha) were analyzed, allowing us to sketch a preliminary outline of the embryonic process in the medfly. Furthermore, a putative homologue of the Zelda gene has been considered, which in D. melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding factor responsible for the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Our novel sexing method facilitates the study of i) when the MTZ transition occurs in males and females of C. capitata, ii) when and how the maternal information of \"female-development\" is reprogrammed in the embryos and iii) similarities and differences in the regulation of gene expression in C. capitata and D. melanogaster. We suggest a new model for the onset of the sex determination cascade in the medfly: the maternally inherited Cctra transcripts in the female embryos are insufficient to produce enough active protein to inhibit the male mode of Cctra splicing. The slow rate of development and the inefficiency of the splicing mechanism in the pre-cellular blastoderm facilitates the male-determining factor (M) activity, which probably acts by inhibiting CcTRA protein activity.",

Zelda has been studied in other endopterygotes: Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum, and the paraneopteran Rhodnius prolixus. We studied Zelda in the cockroach Blattella germanica, a hemimetabolan, short germ-band, and polyneopteran species. B. germanica Zelda has the complete set of functional domains, which is typical of species displaying ancestral features concerning embryogenesis. Interestingly, we found D. melanogaster TAGteam heptamers in the B. germanica genome. The canonical one, CAGGTAG, is present at a similar proportion in the genome of these two species and in the genome of other insects, suggesting that the genome admits as many CAGGTAG motifs as its length allows. Zelda-depleted embryos of B. germanica show defects involving blastoderm formation and abdomen development, and genes contributing to these processes are down-regulated. We conclude that in B. germanica, Zelda strictly activates the zygotic genome, within the MZT, a role conserved in more derived endopterygote insects. In B. germanica, zelda is expressed during MZT, whereas in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum it is expressed beyond this transition. In these species and A. mellifera, Zelda has functions even in postembryonic development. The expansion of zelda expression beyond the MZT in endopterygotes might be related with the evolutionary innovation of holometabolan metamorphosis.

Here, we utilized the MS2 live imaging system to evaluate the expression of the Dl target gene short gastrulation (sog) to better understand how a pioneer factor affects the kinetic parameters of transcription. Our experiments indicate that Zld modifies probability of activation, the timing of this activation, and the rate at which transcription occurs. Our results further show that this effective rate increase is due to an increased accumulation of Dl at the site of transcription, suggesting that transcription factor \"hubs\" induced by Zld [10] functionally regulate transcription.",

Forty-four monotherapy studies of abatacept, adalimumab, baricitinib, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, sarilumab, sirukumab, tocilizumab, and tofacitinib reported in 71 publications were identified. Tocilizumab had the most studies (14), followed by etanercept (10) and adalimumab (9). These b/tsDMARDs were consistently shown to be efficacious treatments, regardless of whether patients were intolerant of or had never used conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs. However, better treatment outcomes were usually achieved with combination therapy, and this was observed for all b/tsDMARDs assessed by this review. Only a few studies provided a head-to-head comparison between b/tsDMARD treatments or between b/tsDMARD monotherapy and combination therapy, and as many were initial RA treatments they were not generalizable to usual care. In conclusion, evidence from randomized trials suggests that the b/tsDMARDs studied are effective as monotherapy. In general, some patient responses seem better with combination therapy and the durability of monotherapy is less than combination therapy.

Treatment wise, great progress has been achieved over the last decades with the discovery and introduction in therapeutics of new molecules, such as the biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and the targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. Today, with such a plethora of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs, tsDMARDs, and bDMARDs, why are we unable to successfully treat RA patients? What is wrong? However, a new drug for RA does not mean it is necessary to switch to a new treatment. It is very easy to change and switch therapies when the patient complains about pain and stiffness. In this setting, it is obligatory to rule out other comorbidities and disorders that may be the cause of the pain first. Thus, clinicians must have a deep knowledge of the drug therapy and be able to adjust the treatment when needed. A minute clinical examination must be carried out on every visit with close monitoring of the patient. A treat-to-target (T2T) approach and the application of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) recommendations and strategies should minimize the unmet needs.",

These agents differ in terms of their effectiveness for controlling specific rheumatic diseases depending on the pivotal cytokine driving the inflammatory process. Cytokine blockers were the first to be developed and rapidly expanded. They include agents that act against tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1) (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and interleukin (IL) 6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL\u20111 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept), IL\u201117 (secukinumab and ixekizumab), and IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) receptors. Lymphocyte\u2011targeting agents include rituximab and belimumab, which act against B cells by different mechanisms, and abatacept, which is a T cell costimulation modulator. tsDMARDs, also known as small\u2011molecule inhibitors, are oral drugs based on a novel strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib) and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors (apremilast) form this group. The major concern with the use of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs is a higher risk of infections. Performance of blood tests as well as screening for tuberculosis and hepatitis viral infection are mandatory prior to biologic therapy initiation. Adherence to an immunization program is also recommended. Whenever possible, the choice of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs should be guided by the patient's comorbidities. There have been limited data on the use of these drugs during pregnancy, but anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy, rituximab, and anakinra seem to be safe. Biologic agents are expensive, but biosimilars have emerged as a cost\u2011effective option with a potential to treat a greater number of patients.",

Only six patients have been described to date. All the previous mutations were truncating variants clustered in the C-terminus of the protein. A previous patient with TRIM8-related epileptic encephalopathy was reported to have nephrotic syndrome. Here we describe the clinical, radiological and histological features of an 8-year-old male patient with a TRIM8 mutation who, in contrast to previous patients, had only mild intellectual disability and well-controlled epilepsy. The patient was found to have proteinuria at 2 years of age. Renal biopsy findings were suggestive of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. His kidney function declined and peritoneal dialysis was started at 5 years of age. He underwent renal transplant at 7 years of age. Trio-based whole genome sequencing identified a novel de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in TRIM8 (NM_030912.2) c.1198_1220del, p.(Tyr400ArgfsTer2). This patient is further evidence that TRIM8 mutations cause a syndrome with both neurological and renal features.

Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are predicted to reduce viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and prevent hospitalization. In this ongoing phase 2 trial involving outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate Covid-19, we randomly assigned 452 patients to receive a single intravenous infusion of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in one of three doses (700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg) or placebo and evaluated the quantitative virologic end points and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the viral load at day 11. The results of a preplanned interim analysis as of September 5, 2020, are reported here. At the time of the interim analysis, the observed mean decrease from baseline in the log viral load for the entire population was -3.81, for an elimination of more than 99.97% of viral RNA. For patients who received the 2800-mg dose of LY-CoV555, the difference from placebo in the decrease from baseline was -0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.98 to -0.08; P = 0.02), for a viral load that was lower by a factor of 3.4. Smaller differences from placebo in the change from baseline were observed among the patients who received the 700-mg dose (-0.20; 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.25; P = 0.38) or the 7000-mg dose (0.09; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.55; P = 0.70). On days 2 to 6, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had a slightly lower severity of symptoms than those who received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a Covid-19-related hospitalization or visit to an emergency department was 1.6% in the LY-CoV555 group and 6.3% in the placebo group.

In the present study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with head-space solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) was employed to analyze the volatile metabolites in the urine samples of 131 subjects. The subjects were divided into 4 main groups: Aggressive B-NHL, indolent B-NHL, benign lymphatic diseases patients and healthy volunteers. The differences of the concentrations of the potential biomarkers among the groups were assessed by non-parametric Wilcoxon's test. The ability of the potential biomarkers to discriminate between the four aforementioned groups was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). The present study indicated that 4-heptanone, 2-methylpyrazine, 2-methylbutanal, 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol and decanoic acid may serve as potential biomarkers for B-NHL. The area under the curve (AUC) values of single potential biomarker ranged from 0.634 to 0.901.

We identified 598 incident lymphoma cases and 601 matched controls in Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study participants with archived pre-diagnosis plasma samples and measured 13 immune marker levels with multiplexed immunoassays. Using multivariable logistic regression we calculated Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) per standard deviation unit increase in biomarker concentration for risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and major histological subtype, stratifying additional models by years (&lt;5, 5 to &lt;10, \u226510) after blood draw.

Blood samples for biomarkers measurements were collected. ELISA method for measurements of circulating level of Gal-3 and NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was used. Hemodynamic evaluation was performed by transthoracic echocardiography. Fifty five cumulative clinical events occurred in 21 patients (25.6%) within the follow-up, with their distribution being as follows: 5 cardiovascular deaths, 24 cardiac arrhythmias, 8 cardiac ischemic events, 3 strokes, 9 chronic heart failures and 6 hospital admissions for cardiovascular reasons. Circulating levels of Gal-3 in subjects without and with cardiovascular events were 5.37 ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI]=2.90-7.85 ng/ml) and 13.97 ng/ml (95% CI=7.82-20.11 ng/ml) (P=0.03) respectively. The results of regression analysis showed directly related circulating Gal-3 with E/Em (r=0.45, P=0.045), T2DM (r=0.38, P=0.01). Multivariate logistic regression revealed independent predictive value of circulating Gal-3 for 12 months cumulative cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR]=1.11; 95% CI=1.05-1.25; P=0.005). In fact, Gal-3, NT-pro-BNP, GFR, and LVEF remained statistically significant predictors for cumulative cardiovascular events, whereas T2DM, hypertension, obesity did not.

Nevertheless, it is known that they can survive limited exposure to air, and often eliminate oxygen or reactive derivatives via NAD(P)H-dependent reduction. This system does apparently contribute to survival after oxidative stress, but is insufficient to establish long-term tolerance of aerobic conditions. Here we show that manipulation of the regulatory mechanism of this defence mechanism can trigger aerotolerance in the obligate anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum. Deletion of a peroxide repressor (PerR)-homologous protein resulted in prolonged aerotolerance, limited growth under aerobic conditions and rapid consumption of oxygen from an aerobic environment. The mutant strain also revealed higher resistance to H2O2 and activities of NADH-dependent scavenging of H2O2 and organic peroxides in cell-free extracts increased by at least one order of magnitude. Several genes encoding the putative enzymes were upregulated and identified as members of the clostridial PerR regulon, including the heat shock protein Hsp21, a reverse rubrerythrin which was massively produced and became the most abundant protein in the absence of PerR. This multifunctional protein is proposed to play the crucial role in the oxidative stress defence.",

Apple juice with varying pH values was used to determine the effect of pH on germination capability of C. pasteurianum spores. The spores were found to be able to germinate at pH as low as 4.3 in pH-adjusted apple juice at low contamination levels. It was confirmed by PCR that C. pasteurianum isolated from spoiled apple juice did not contain the genes for botulinum toxins B and E, which were more commonly found in neurotoxigenic butyric clostridia.

C. difficile infections begin when its metabolically dormant spores germinate in the gut of susceptible individuals. Binding of bile salt germinants to the Csp family pseudoprotease CspC triggers a proteolytic signaling cascade consisting of the Csp family protease CspB and the cortex hydrolase SleC. Conserved across many of the Clostridia, Csp proteases are subtilisin-like serine proteases that activate pro-SleC by cleaving off its inhibitory pro-peptide. Active SleC degrades the protective cortex layer, allowing spores to resume metabolism and growth. This signaling pathway, however, is differentially regulated in C. difficile, since CspC functions both as a germinant receptor and regulator of CspB activity. CspB is also produced as a fusion to a catalytically inactive CspA domain that subsequently undergoes interdomain processing during spore formation. In this study, we investigated the role of the CspA pseudoprotease domain in regulating C. difficile spore germination. Mutational analyses revealed that the CspA domain controls CspC germinant receptor levels in mature spores and is required for optimal spore germination, particularly when CspA is fused to the CspB protease. During spore formation, the YabG protease separates these domains, although YabG itself is dispensable for germination. Bioinformatic analyses of Csp family members suggest that the CspC-regulated signaling pathway characterized in C. difficile is conserved in related Peptostreptococcaceae family members but not in the Clostridiaceae or Lachnospiraceae. Our results indicate that pseudoproteases play critical roles in regulating C. difficile spore germination and highlight that diverse mechanisms control spore germination in the Clostridia.",

Use of natural antimicrobials has been favoured over synthetic molecules in food preservation owing to concerns over the adverse health effects of synthetic chemicals. The continuing need for novel natural antimicrobial compounds has spurred research to investigate natural sources, such as bacteria, for antimicrobials. The antimicrobial-producing potential of bacteria has been investigated in numerous studies. However, the discovery of antimicrobials has been biased towards aerobes and facultative anaerobes, and strict anaerobes such as Clostridium spp. have been largely neglected. In recent years, genomic studies have indicated the genetic potential of strict anaerobes to produce putative bioactive molecules and this has encouraged the exploration of Clostridium spp. for their antimicrobial production. So far, only a limited number of antimicrobial compounds have been isolated, identified and characterised from the genus Clostridium. This review discusses our current knowledge and understanding of clostridial antimicrobial compounds as well as recent genome mining studies of Clostridium spp. focused at identification of putative gene clusters encoding bacterial secondary metabolite groups and peptides reported to possess antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, opportunities and challenges in the identification of antimicrobials from Clostridium spp. using genomic-guided approaches are discussed.

A mode of genetic regulation that involves insulators and insulator binding proteins to establish independent transcriptional units is currently not known in nematodes including Caenorhabditis elegans. We therefore searched in nematodes for orthologs of proteins that are involved in chromatin insulation. While orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all 35 analysed nematode species, we find orthologs of CTCF in a subset of nematodes. As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans and other derived nematodes does so. Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more derived nematodes.

Here we describe a systematic approach to discover and characterize regulatory motifs within mammalian CNEs by searching for long motifs (12-22 nt) with significant enrichment in CNEs and studying their biochemical and genomic properties. Our analysis identifies 233 long motifs (LMs), matching a total of approximately 60,000 conserved instances across the human genome. These motifs include 16 previously known regulatory elements, such as the histone 3'-UTR motif and the neuron-restrictive silencer element, as well as striking examples of novel functional elements. The most highly enriched motif (LM1) corresponds to the X-box motif known from yeast and nematode. We show that it is bound by the RFX1 protein and identify thousands of conserved motif instances, suggesting a broad role for the RFX family in gene regulation. A second group of motifs (LM2*) does not match any previously known motif. We demonstrate by biochemical and computational methods that it defines a binding site for the CTCF protein, which is involved in insulator function to limit the spread of gene activation. We identify nearly 15,000 conserved sites that likely serve as insulators, and we show that nearby genes separated by predicted CTCF sites show markedly reduced correlation in gene expression.

It has important roles in transcriptional insulation and the formation of a high-dimensional chromatin structure. CTCF has a paralog called \"Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites\" (BORIS) or \"CTCF-like\" (CTCFL). It binds DNA at sites similar to those of CTCF. However, the expression profiles of the two proteins are quite different. We investigated the evolutionary trajectories of the two proteins after the duplication event using a phylogenomic and interactomic approach. We find that CTCF has 52 direct interaction partners while CTCFL only has 19. Almost all interactors already existed before the emergence of CTCF and CTCFL. The unique secondary loss of CTCF from several nematodes is paralleled by a loss of two of its interactors, the polycomb repressive complex subunit SuZ12 and the multifunctional transcription factor TYY1. In contrast to earlier studies reporting the absence of BORIS from birds, we present evidence for a multigene synteny block containing CTCFL that is conserved in mammals, reptiles, and several species of birds, indicating that not the entire lineage of birds experienced a loss of CTCFL. Within this synteny block, BORIS and its genomic neighbors seem to be partitioned into two nested chromatin loops. The high expression of SPO11, RAE1, RBM38, and PMEPA1 in male tissues suggests a possible link between CTCFL, meiotic recombination, and fertility-associated phenotypes. Using the 65,700 exomes and the 1000 genomes data, we observed a higher number of intergenic, non-synonymous, and loss-of-function mutations in CTCFL than in CTCF, suggesting a reduced strength of purifying selection, perhaps due to less functional constraint.",

We showed that this loss of genomic data could be mitigated by sequencing whole genomes from needle core biopsies. Storage of resection specimens at 4 \u00b0C for up to 96 h overcame the challenge of freezing tissue out of hours including weekends. Removing access to formalin increased compliance to these storage arrangements. With over 70 different sarcoma subtypes described, WGS was a useful tool for refining diagnoses and identifying novel alterations. Genomes from 350 of the cohort of 597 patients were analysed in this study. Overall, diagnoses were modified for 3% of patients following review of the WGS findings. Continued refinement of the variant-calling bioinformatic pipelines is required as not all alterations were identified when validated against histology and standard of care diagnostic tests. Further research is necessary to evaluate the impact of germline mutations in patients with sarcoma, and sarcomas with evidence of hypermutation. Despite 50% of the WGS exhibiting domain 1 alterations, the number of patients with sarcoma who were eligible for clinical trials remains small, highlighting the need to revaluate clinical trial design.",

The purpose of the present study is to estimate the lifetime risk of cancers induced by occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers. Using estimated organ doses and the RadRAT risk assessment tool, the lifetime cancer risk was estimated among medical radiation workers who were enrolled in the Korean National Dose Registry from 1996 to 2011. Median doses were used for estimating the risk because of the skewed distribution of radiation doses. Realistic representative exposure scenarios in the study population based on sex, job start year, and occupational group were created for calculating the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR). The mean estimated lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure varied significantly by sex and occupational group. The highest LAR was observed in male and female radiologic technologists who started work in 1991 (264.4/100,000 and 391.2/100,000, respectively). Female workers had a higher risk of radiation-related excess cancer, although they were exposed to lower radiation doses than male workers. The higher LAR among women was attributable primarily to excess breast and thyroid cancer risks. LARs among men were higher than women in most other cancer sites. With respect to organ sites, LAR of colon cancer (44.3/100,000) was the highest in male radiologic technologists, whereas LAR of thyroid cancer (222.0/100,000) was the highest in female radiologic technologists among workers who started radiologic practice in 1991. Thyroid and bladder cancers had the highest LFR among radiologic technologists. Our findings provide an assessment of the potential cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers, based on current knowledge about radiation risk. Although the radiation-related risk was small in most cases, it varied widely by sex and occupational group, and the risk would be underestimated due to the use of median, rather than mean, doses. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary to optimize radiation doses and protect medical radiation workers from potential health risks, particularly female radiologic technologists.",

Organ doses were estimated from surveys of individual scan parameters and CT protocols used in the United Kingdom. Frequencies of scans were estimated from the NHS Diagnostic Imaging Dataset. Excess lifetime risks (ELRs) of radiation-related cancer were calculated as cumulative lifetime risks, accounting for survival probabilities, using the RadRAT risk assessment tool. In 2000-2008, ELRs ranged from 0.3 to 1 per 1000 head scans and 1 to 5 per 1000 non-head scans. ELRs per scan were reduced by 50-70% in 2000-2008 compared with 1990-1995, subsequent to dose reduction over time. The 130 750 scans performed in 2015 in the United Kingdom were projected to induce 64 (90% uncertainty interval (UI): 38-113) future cancers. Current practices would lead to about 300 (90% UI: 230-680) future cancers induced by scans performed in 2016-2020. Absolute excess risks from single exposures would be low compared with background risks, but even small increases in annual CT rates over the next years would substantially increase the number of potential subsequent cancers.",

The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses &lt; 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",

Therefore, despite its relatively rare occurrence, melanoma continues to cause the majority of skin cancer deaths, with less than 15% of those affected with late-stage disease surviving 10 years or more. Historically, the mainstay of treatment has been single-agent chemotherapy or immunotherapy with the alkylating agent dacarbazine and interleukin-2 or interferon. Cytotoxic chemotherapy with dacarbazine demonstrated poor response rates and little or no survival benefit, whereas IL-2 and interferon, although showing durable responses, are associated with poor side effect profiles (1, 2). However, with the elucidation of the molecular biology and oncogenic pathways involved in melanoma, agents targeted against mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway including BRAF and MEK inhibitors have demonstrated prolonged survival and more manageable side effect profiles relative to traditional chemotherapy. Simultaneously, an evolved understanding of the immunologic basis for the development and regression of melanoma lead to the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which confer a similar survival benefit. Foremost among these was ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody against the negative regulatory checkpoint molecule cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4), which was the first drug in the management of metastatic melanoma to confer a survival benefit. However, treatment is complicated by a high rate of grade 3 and 4 immune-related adverse events and limited response. Nivolumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), has shown a survival benefit in an open-label phase II trial, and was the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved worldwide. With a favorable side effect profile and ongoing trials in combination with extant therapies, nivolumab shows substantial potential to further augment the options for an effective treatment in malignant melanoma.",

Thirty patients with untreated unresectable/metastatic melanoma were treated with ipilimumab and CP. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored and response to treatment was evaluated. Tumor tissue and peripheral blood were collected at specified time points to characterize tumor immune markers by immunohistochemistry and systemic immune activity by multiplex assays and flow cytometry. Eighty three percent of patients received all 5 cycles of CP and 93% completed ipilimumab induction. Serious AEs occurred in 13% of patients, and no treatment-related deaths were observed. Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) were 27 and 57%, respectively. Median overall survival was 16.2 months. Response to treatment was positively correlated with a higher tumor CD3<sup>+</sup> infiltrate (immune score) at baseline.

The effect of the discontinuation of vemurafenib therapy on ocular manifestations was assessed, as well as the effect of rechallenging when vemurafenib was reintroduced. Seven patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [4.0] years) had uveitis. The vemurafenib dose was 960 mg twice per day in 6 patients and a half dose in 1 patient.

Here we analyze genome-wide changes in transcript levels, binding of the Notch pathway transcription factor, CSL [Suppressor of Hairless, Su(H), in Drosophila], and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) immediately following a short pulse of Notch stimulation. A total of 154 genes showed significant differential expression (DE) over time, and their expression profiles stratified into 14 clusters based on the timing, magnitude, and direction of DE. E(spl) genes were the most rapidly upregulated, with Su(H), Pol II, and transcript levels increasing within 5-10 minutes. Other genes had a more delayed response, the timing of which was largely unaffected by more prolonged Notch activation. Neither Su(H) binding nor poised Pol II could fully explain the differences between profiles. Instead, our data indicate that regulatory interactions, driven by the early-responding E(spl)bHLH genes, are required. Proposed cross-regulatory relationships were validated in vivo and in cell culture, supporting the view that feed-forward repression by E(spl)bHLH/Hes shapes the response of late-responding genes.

We find that Hes1 protein is present in somatic cells and oocyte cytoplasm and decreases between E15.5 and P0. Conventional Hes1 knock-out (KO), Hes1 conditional KO in the ovarian somatic, and chemical inhibition of Notch signaling decrease the total number, size and maturation of oocytes and increase the number of pregranulosa cells at P0. These defects correlate with abnormal proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. Expression of the proapoptotic gene Inhbb is increased, while the levels of the antiapoptotic and oocyte maturation marker Kit are decreased in the Hes1 KO ovaries. Conversely, overactivation of the Notch pathway in ovarian somatic cells increases the number of mature oocytes and decreases the number of pregranulosa cells.

There are seven members in the human Hes family, Hes1-7, which are expressed in many tissues and play various roles mainly in development. All Hes proteins have three conserved domains: basic HLH (bHLH), Orange, and WRPW domains. The basic region binds to target DNA sequences, while the HLH region forms homo- and heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, the Orange domain is responsible for the selection of partners during heterodimer formation, and the WRPW domain recruits corepressors. Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of canonical Notch signaling, which regulates cell differentiation via cell-cell interaction. Hes factors regulate many events in development by repressing the expression of target genes, many of which encode transcriptional activators that promote cell differentiation. For example, Hes1, Hes3, and Hes5 are highly expressed by neural stem cells, and inactivation of these genes results in insufficient maintenance of stem cell proliferation and prematurely promotes neuronal differentiation.

Prior studies have shown that during early embryogenesis in mouse and zebrafish, deficit of RERE causes various patterning defects in multiple organs including the neural tube. Here, we detected the expression of RERE in the developing chick spinal cord, and found that normal RERE activity is needed for proper neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation possibly by affecting Notch-mediated Hes expression. In mammalian cells, RERE co-immunoprecipitates with CBF1 and Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and is recruited to nuclear foci formed by over-expressed NICD1. RERE is also necessary for NICD to activate the expression of Notch target genes.

These proteins are normally induced by Notch activity and inhibit neural commitment by antagonizing the activity of proneural genes. We describe here four chick hes genes that are expressed during neurogenesis: three hes5-like genes (hes5-1, hes5-2 and hes5-3) and one hes6-like (hes6-2). We show that hes6-2 represses transcription of the hes5 genes, thus functioning as a negative regulator of Notch signaling. Conversely, hes6-2 may be repressed by hes5 activity. In cells committing to differentiation, we find that hes6-2 is up-regulated by proneural genes and contributes to the proneural program of neuronal commitment by preventing Notch activity in these cells. In neural progenitors, Notch signaling produces an initial burst of hes5 activity, which represses hes6-2. However, as hes5 transcription declines due to negative auto-regulation, hes6-2 may become active and inhibit the remaining hes5 activity to end Notch signaling. These cells can then enter a new cycle of fate decisions and will be kept as progenitors if a new pulse of Notch activity occurs. Maintenance of progenitors during vertebrate neurogenesis therefore requires that these cells go through successive cycles of Notch activity. We propose that the hes5/hes6 circuitry of negative cross-regulations is a conserved feature of the Notch pathway that underlies these cycles in neural progenitors.",

Here, we isolated and characterized the mouse Hes2 gene. This gene consists of four exons, and all the introns are located within the protein-coding region at positions homologous to those of other Hes genes. On the inter-specific backcross analyses, mouse Hes2 is mapped to the distal region of Chromosome 4 near the Hes3 and Hes5 loci, which are different from the Hes1 locus on Chromosome 16. Upstream of the transcription initiation site, there are GC-rich regions, but a typical TATA box is not present. Transient transfection analyses demonstrated that, while Hes1 and Hes5 promoter activities are significantly upregulated by the active form of Notch, a key regulator of cellular differentiation, Hes2 and Hes3 promoter activities are not. These results suggest that Hes genes are functionally classified into two groups: those that are regulated by Notch and those that are not.",

Previous expression data suggested a conserved role for the Hes genes in the Notch signalling pathway, but not in segmentation. Here, Hes3 expression during mouse embryogenesis is described. During early development of the central nervous system, Hes3 is expressed specifically in the region of the midbrain/hindbrain boundary, and in rhombomeres 2, 4, 6 and 7. This pattern suggests that Hes3 may have a conserved role as a segmentation gene. Later in development, Hes3 is co-expressed with other neurogenic gene homologues in the developing central nervous system and epithelial cells undergoing mesenchyme induction.",

Within the trophoblast lineage, Mash-2 transcripts are first expressed in the ectoplacental cone and chorion, but not in terminally differentiated trophoblast giant cells. After day 8.5 of gestation, Mash-2 expression becomes further restricted to focal sites within the spongiotrophoblast and labyrinth. Downregulation is probably important for normal development since overexpression of Mash-2 reduces giant cell formation. We have investigated the role that the Notch signaling pathway may play in trophoblast development. Mash-2 is a homologue of Drosophila achaete/scute complex genes. In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which interact with the Groucho protein to shut off achaete-scute transcription. In the developing mouse placenta, we found that all elements of the Notch pathway were expressed. In particular, the Notch-2, HES-2, and HES-3 genes were coexpressed in trophoblast giant cells and in foci within the spongiotrophoblast at day 10.5 when Mash-2 transcription becomes restricted. Two members of the mammalian Groucho family were expressed in trophoblasts; TLE3 was expressed broadly in the giant cell, spongiotrophoblast, and labyrinthine regions, whereas TLE2 was limited to giant cells and focal regions of the spongiotrophoblast. These data suggest that Notch signaling through activation of HES transcriptional repressors may play a role in murine placental development.",

Studies of the mechanisms controlling the fine balance between neural stem cells and more differentiated progenitors have shown that, in every asymmetric cell division, progenitors send a Delta-Notch signal to their sibling stem cells. Here, we show that excessive activation of Notch or overexpression of its direct targets of the Hes family causes stem-cell hyperplasias in the <i>Drosophila</i> larval central nervous system, which can progress to malignant tumours after allografting to adult hosts. We combined transcriptomic data from these hyperplasias with chromatin occupancy data for Dpn, a Hes transcription factor, to identify genes regulated by Hes factors in this process. We show that the Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes. These are excluded from the stem cells and promote early differentiation steps, most likely by preventing the reversion of immature progenitors to a stem-cell fate. We describe the impact of two of these 'anti-stemness' factors, Zfh1 and Gcm, on Notch/Hes-triggered tumorigenesis.",

An evolutionary conserved program consisting of Notch signalling mediated by basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor activity is necessary for both the maintenance of neural progenitor cell character and the progression of neurogenesis; however, additional players in mammalian CNS neural specification remain largely unknown. In Drosophila we recently characterized Hamlet, a transcription factor that mediates Notch signalling and neural cell fate. Hamlet is a member of the Prdm (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing) proto-oncogene transcription factor family, and in this study we report that multiple genes in the Prdm family (Prdm6, 8, 12, 13 and 16) are expressed in the developing mouse CNS in a spatially and temporally restricted manner. In developing spinal cord Prdm8, 12 and 13 are expressed in precise neuronal progenitor zones suggesting that they may specify discrete neuronal subtypes. In developing telencephalon Prdm12 and 16 are expressed in the ventricular zone in a lateral to medial graded manner, and Prdm8 is expressed in a complementary domain in postmitotic neurons. In postnatal brain Prdm8 additionally shows restricted expression in cortical layers 2/3 and 4, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. To further elucidate roles of Prdm8 and 16 in the developing telencephalon we analyzed the relationship between these factors and the bHLH Hes (Hairy and enhancer of split homolog) effectors of Notch signalling. In Hes null telencephalon neural differentiation is enhanced, Prdm8 expression is upregulated, and Prdm16 expression is downregulated; conversely in utero electroporation of Hes1 into the developing telencephalon upregulates Prdm16 expression. Our data demonstrate that Prdm genes are regulated by the Notch-Hes pathway and represent strong candidates to control neural class specification and the sequential progression of mammalian CNS neurogenesis.",

HESR1 is a downstream target of Notch in endothelial cells and could be an effector of Notch signaling in these cells. HESR1 is necessary for the induction of a tubular network and for continued maintenance of mature and quiescent blood vessels. To examine the role of HESR1 in retinal neovascularization, we transfected retinal vascular endothelial cells (HRCECs) with the HESR1 gene and studied its effects on the expression of angiogenic factors, on the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and on the formation of tube-like structures (TLSs). Overexpression of HESR1 downregulated VEGFR-2 expression, upregulated occludin expression, inhibited the migration and proliferation of HRCECs, and inhibited the formation of TLSs. Thus, HESR1 plays a key role in the finely tuned network of molecules involved in the regulation of retinal vascular homeostasis. HESR1 seems to inhibit the vessel-promoting effects of VEGF, shift endothelial cells from a proliferative state to a quiescent state, and restore normal vessel structures. Expression of the HESR1 gene in retinal vascular endothelial cells may protect retinal blood vessels and may be useful in the treatment of diseases involving damage to the retinal vasculature, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion.",

Using the yeast two-hybrid approach, a previously uncharacterized protein was identified in Xenopus that interacts with XHRT1 (originally referred to as bc8), one member of the HRT/Hey subclass. This protein is evolutionarily conserved in chordates. It binds to sequences adjacent to the bHLH domain of XHRT1 known as the Orange domain and has been named bc8 Orange interacting protein (BOIP). BOIP shows a rather uniform subcellular localization and is recruited to the nucleus upon binding to XHRT1. In Xenopus, XBOIP mRNA is detected by RNase protection analysis throughout embryogenesis. In the adult, the strongest expression is detected in testis. In the mouse, high levels of BOIP mRNA are also found in adult testis. No expression is detected in the embryo and in any of the other adult organs tested. In situ hybridization revealed that BOIP transcripts were detected almost exclusively in round spermatids and that this expression overlaps with that of Hey1 (HRT1), which is expressed throughout spermatogenesis. In view of the importance of the Orange domain for HRT/Hey function, the newly identified BOIP proteins may serve as regulators specifically of HRT1/Hey1 activity.",

It has been shown in Drosophila melanogaster that Delta-dependent Notch signaling activates the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless, leading to an increased expression of the Enhancer of Split genes. Genetic evidence has also implicated the kuzbanian gene, which encodes a disintegrin metalloprotease, in the Notch signaling pathway. By using a two-cell coculture assay, we show here that vertebrate Dl-1 activates the Notch-1 cascade. Consistent with previous data obtained with active forms of Notch-1 a HES-1-derived promoter construct is transactivated in cells expressing Notch-1 in response to Dl-1 stimulation. Impairing the proteolytic maturation of the full-length receptor leads to a decrease in HES-1 transactivation, further supporting the hypothesis that only mature processed Notch is expressed at the cell surface and activated by its ligand. Furthermore, we observed that Dl-1-induced HES-1 transactivation was dependent both on Kuzbanian and RBP-J activities, consistent with the involvement of these two proteins in Notch signaling in Drosophila. We also observed that exposure of Notch-1-expressing cells to Dl-1 results in an increased level of endogenous HES-1 mRNA. Finally, coculture of Dl-1-expressing cells with myogenic C2 cells suppresses differentiation of C2 cells into myotubes, as previously demonstrated for Jagged-1 and Jagged-2, and also leads to an increased level of endogenous HES-1 mRNA. Thus, Dl-1 behaves as a functional ligand for Notch-1 and has the same ability to suppress cell differentiation as the Jagged proteins do.",

The molecular details of how Hes and Hey proteins control transcription are still poorly understood, however. Proposed modes of action include direct binding to N- or E-box DNA sequences of target promoters as well as indirect binding through other sequence-specific transcription factors or sequestration of transcriptional activators. Repression may rely on recruitment of corepressors and induction of histone modifications, or even interference with the general transcriptional machinery. All of these models require extensive protein-protein interactions.

We report on all the children and young people seen at a single large tertiary centre. Data were collected through a retrospective case-notes review. Twelve individuals from 10 families were identified. Eight different mutations were present, including four novel mutations. Two patients displayed a very severe phenotype including congenital contractures, severe spasticity and/or dystonia, dysautonomia, severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy and optic atrophy, significant white matter changes on brain MRI, respiratory insufficiency, and complete lack of neurodevelopmental progress. The remaining 10 patients represented a spectrum of severity with common features including a movement disorder with spasticity and/or dystonia, subtle features of dysautonomia, sensory axonal neuropathy, varying degrees of optic atrophy and of learning and/or behavioural difficulties, and subtle or absent-but sometimes progressive-changes in white matter on MRI.

As such, it has been considered as a relevant target in disorders as varied as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, neuropathic pain and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A range of competitive antagonists/inverse agonists have progressed into clinical development, with pitolisant approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. Given the breadth of compounds developed and potential therapeutic indications, we assessed the comparative pharmacology of six investigational histamine H<sub>3</sub> agents, including pitolisant, using native tissue and recombinant cells. Whilst all of the compounds tested displayed robust histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor inverse agonism and did not differentiate between the main H<sub>3</sub> receptor splice variants, they displayed a wide range of affinities and kinetic properties, and included rapidly dissociating (pitolisant, S 38093-2, ABT-239) and slowly dissociating (GSK189254, JNJ-5207852, PF-3654746) agents. S 38093-2 had the lowest histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor affinity (pK<sub>B</sub> values 5.7-6.2), seemingly at odds with previously reported, potent in vivo activity in models of cognition. We show here that at pro-cognitive and anti-hyperalgesic/anti-allodynic doses, S 38093-2 preferentially occupies the mouse sigma-1 receptor in vivo, only engaging the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor at doses associated with wakefulness promotion and neurotransmitter (histamine, ACh) release. Furthermore, pitolisant, ABT-239 and PF-3654746 also displayed appreciable sigma-1 receptor affinity, suggesting that this property differentiates clinically evaluated histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists and may play a role in their efficacy.",

To induce obesity, male CD-1 mice were fed a high-fat diet consisting of 40% fat blend for 14 weeks, water and 30% sucrose solution available ad libitum. Glucose tolerance test was performed at the beginning of week 15. Insulin tolerance was tested the day after. At the end of study, plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterol were determined. Pitolisant at dose of 10 mg/kg bw (ip) was administrated during 14 days, starting from the beginning of week 13. Metformin at dose of 100 mg/kg bw (ip) was used as reference drug. Mice fed with high-fat diet and sucrose solution showed more weight gain throughout the 12-week period of inducing obesity. Animals fed with high-fat diet and treated with pitolisant (for the next 14 days) showed significantly less weight gain than mice from the control group consuming a high-fat feed. In the group treated with pitolisant, glucose levels were significantly lower than glucose levels of control obese mice after glucose load. The plasma triglyceride levels in pitolisant-treated mice were significantly lower compared with those in control obese group.

Although only a few drugs have received regulatory approval for narcolepsy to date, treatment involves diverse medications that affect multiple biochemical targets and neural circuits. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the following classes of drugs as narcolepsy treatments: alerting medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol [JZP-110]), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), sodium oxybate, and the H<sub>3</sub>-receptor inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant. Enhanced catecholamine availability and regulation of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neuron activity is likely central to the therapeutic activity of most of these compounds. LC NE neurons are integral to sleep/wake regulation and muscle tone; reduced excitatory input to the LC due to compromise of Hcrt/orexin neurons (likely due to autoimmune factors) results in LC NE dysregulation and contributes to narcolepsy/cataplexy symptoms. Agents that increase catecholamines and/or LC activity may mitigate EDS and cataplexy by elevating NE regulation of GABAergic inputs from the amygdala. Consequently, novel medications and treatment strategies aimed at preserving and/or modulating Hcrt/orexin-LC circuit integrity are warranted in narcolepsy/cataplexy.",

In contrast to the other histamine receptor subtypes (H<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>4</sub>), the H<sub>3</sub> receptor is located presynaptically and shows a constitutive activity. In detail, H<sub>3</sub> receptors are involved in the inhibition of histamine release (presynaptic autoreceptor), impulse flow along the histaminergic neurones (somadendritic autoreceptor) and histamine synthesis. Moreover, they occur as inhibitory presynaptic heteroreceptors on serotoninergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic and perhaps cholinergic neurones. This review shows for four functions of the brain that the H<sub>3</sub> receptor represents a brake against the wake-promoting, anticonvulsant and anorectic effect of histamine (via postsynaptic H<sub>1</sub> receptors) and its procognitive activity (via postsynaptic H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> receptors). Indeed, H<sub>1</sub> agonists and H<sub>3</sub> inverse agonists elicit essentially the same effects, at least in rodents; these effects are opposite in direction to those elicited by brain-penetrating H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists in humans.

The interest in the identification of presynaptic receptors has faded in recent years and it may therefore be justified to give an overview of their occurrence in the autonomic and central nervous system; this review will focus on presynaptic receptors in human tissues. Autoreceptors are presynaptic receptors at which a given transmitter restrains its further release, though in some instances may also increase its release. Inhibitory autoreceptors represent a typical example of a negative feedback; they are tonically activated by the respective endogenous transmitter and/or are constitutively active. Autoreceptors also play a role under pathophysiological conditions, e.g. by limiting the massive noradrenaline release occurring during congestive heart failure. They can be used for therapeutic purposes; e.g., the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist mirtazapine is used as an antidepressant and the inverse histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist pitolisant has been marketed as a new drug for the treatment of narcolepsy in 2016. Heteroreceptors are presynaptic receptors at which transmitters from adjacent neurons, locally formed mediators (e.g. endocannabinoids) or hormones (e.g. adrenaline) can inhibit or facilitate transmitter release; they may be subject to an endogenous tone. The constipating effect of the sympathetic nervous system or of the antihypertensive drug clonidine is related to the activation of inhibitory \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors on postganglionic parasympathetic neurons.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant, a histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist, for treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. For this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 16 sleep centres in nine countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine). Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy according to version two of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria, experienced at least three cataplexies per week, and had excessive daytime sleepiness (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score \u226512). We used a computer-generated sequence via an interactive web response system to randomly assign patients to receive either pitolisant or placebo once per day (1:1 ratio). Randomisation was done in blocks of four. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation.

In ICSD-3, the names of some central disorders of hypersomnolence have been changed: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy have been renamed narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2, respectively. A low level of hypocretin-1/orexin-A in the CSF is now theoretically sufficient to diagnose narcolepsy type 1, as it is a highly specific and sensitive biomarker. Conversely, other central hypersomnias are less well-defined disorders with variability in the phenotype, and few reliable biomarkers have been discovered so far. The epidemiologic observation that influenza A (H1N1) infection and vaccination are potential triggering factors of narcolepsy type 1 (discovered during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) has increased interest in this rare disease, and progress is being made to better understand the process (highly suspected to be autoimmune) responsible for the destruction of hypocretin neurons. Treatment of narcolepsy remains largely symptomatic, usually initially with modafinil or armodafinil or with higher-potency stimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamines.

All teenagers developed their disease during childhood (11.3 \u00b1 2.4 years; 50% boys) and were 17.3 \u00b1 0.8 years old at the time of pitolisant therapy. Pitolisant treatment was increased from 10 to 30 mg (n = 1) and 40 mg (n = 3). The adapted Epworth Sleepiness Score decreased from 14.3 \u00b1 1.1 to 9.5 \u00b1 2.9 (P = 0.03) with pitolisant alone to 7 \u00b1 3.4 when combined with mazindol (n = 1), methylphenidate (n = 1), or sodium oxybate plus modafinil (n = 1). Mean sleep onset latency increased from 31 \u00b1 14 minutes to 36 \u00b1 8 minutes (P = 0.21) on the maintenance of wakefulness test. The severity and frequency of cataplexy were slightly improved. Adverse effects were minor (insomnia, headache, hot flushes, leg pain, and hallucinations) and transitory, except for insomnia, which persisted in 2 teenagers. The benefit was maintained after a mean of 13 months. Pitolisant could constitute an acceptable alternative for the treatment of refractory sleepiness in teenagers with narcolepsy.",

Inhibition of histone H3 lysine N-methyltransferase, especially G9a, has been recently shown to restore candidate genes from silenced parental chromosomes in the imprinting disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In addition to this epigenetic approach, pitolisant as G-protein coupled histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor (H<sub>3</sub>R) antagonist has demonstrated promising therapeutic effects for Prader-Willi syndrome. To combine these pioneering principles of drug action, we aimed to identify compounds that combine both activities, guided by the pharmacophore blueprint for both targets. However, pitolisant as selective H<sub>3</sub>R inverse agonist with FDA and EMA-approval did not show the required inhibition at G9a. Pharmacological characterization of the prominent G9a inhibitor A-366, that is as well an inhibitor of the epigenetic reader protein Spindlin1, revealed its high affinity at H<sub>3</sub>R while showing subtype selectivity among subsets of the histaminergic and dopaminergic receptor families. This work moves prominent G9a ligands forward as pharmacological tools to prove for a potentially combined, symptomatic and causal, therapy in PWS by bridging the gap between drug development for G-protein coupled receptors and G9a as an epigenetic effector in a multi-targeting approach.",

They can also compensate for metabolic disorders, which affect glucose or triglyceride levels. In previous studies, we have shown that pitolisant, a histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist/inverse agonist and \u03c31 receptor agonist, prevented the development of certain metabolic and depressive-like disorders in mice that have been treated chronically with olanzapine. As a continuation of our previous experiments, this study aimed to investigate the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activity of pitolisant in mice using the corticosterone-induced depression model. The forced swim and the elevated plus maze tests were used as behavioral endpoints. We also studied the effect pitolisant had on the level of acetoacetic acid in the urine as well as the glucose tolerance and body weight of the mice that had been administered corticosterone. Pitolisant (10 mg/kg b.w.) did not prevent depressive-like behavior in mice during the chronic corticosterone administration but did counteract anxiety-like behavior, whilst fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was shown to protect the mice from both of these behaviors. None of the treatments that were used in the study showed an effect on the locomotor activity of the mice. Pitolisant did not prevent an increase in acetoacetic acid levels in the urine, nor did it improve glucose tolerance in the tested mice. Although literature data indicates that there is significant potential for finding an antidepressant and anti-diabetic drug among the histamine H<sub>3</sub> and \u03c31 receptor ligands, in our study, pitolisant was shown to only slightly compensate for corticosterone-induced abnormalities.

Since H(3)-ligands can decrease inflammatory pain, we tested Pitolisant in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. MATERIALS AND TREATMENTS: Behavioral effects of pitolisant and the structural different H(3) receptor inverse agonists ciproxifan and ST-889 were tested in zymosan-induced inflammation and the spared nerve injury model for neuropathic pain. Responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli were determined. Calcium imaging was performed with primary neuronal cultures of dorsal root ganglions. Clinically relevant doses of pitolisant (10 mg/kg) had no relevant effect on mechanical or thermal pain thresholds in all animal models. Higher doses (50 mg/kg) dramatically increased thermal but not mechanical pain thresholds. Neither ciproxifan nor ST-889 altered thermal pain thresholds. In peripheral sensory neurons high concentrations of pitolisant (30-500 \u03bcM), but not ciproxifan, partially inhibited calcium increases induced by capsaicin, a selective activator of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1). High doses of pitolisant induced a strong hypothermia. The data show a dramatic effect of high dosages of pitolisant on the thermosensory system, which appears to be H(3) receptor-independent.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32032921": "Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder of sleep-wake state instability. This instability underlies all narcolepsy symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysregulation (ie, cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Several neurotransmitter systems promote wakefulness, and various neural pathways are involved in regulating REM sleep-related muscle atonia, providing multiple targets for pharmacologic intervention to reduce EDS and cataplexy. Medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy include traditional stimulants (eg, amphetamines, methylphenidate), wake-promoting agents (eg, modafinil, armodafinil), and solriamfetol, which mainly act on dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways. Sodium oxybate (thought to act via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors) is FDA-approved for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy. Pitolisant, a histamine 3 (H<sub>3</sub>)-receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in adults and by the FDA for the treatment of EDS in adults with narcolepsy. Pitolisant increases the synthesis and release of histamine in the brain and modulates the release of other neurotransmitters (eg, norepinephrine, dopamine). Antidepressants that inhibit reuptake of serotonin and/or norepinephrine are widely used off label to manage cataplexy. In many patients with narcolepsy, combination treatment with medications that act via different neural pathways is necessary for optimal symptom management. Mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and abuse potential are important considerations in treatment selection and subsequent medication adjustments to maximize efficacy and mitigate adverse effects in the treatment of patients with narcolepsy.",

However, these potentiating effects of thioperamide do not necessarily result from H3 receptor blockade since thioperamide is an imidazole-based compound capable of enhancing plasma cocaine concentrations by blocking cytochrome P450 activity. In contrast, Pitolisant is a non-imidazole H3 receptor inverse agonist that has already been tested in clinical trials but it remains to be determined whether this compound also potentiates the behavioral effects of cocaine. The present study tested the effects of Pitolisant on locomotion, on cocaine-induced hyperactivity and on the development of conditioned place preference induced by cocaine (2 and 8mg/kg, i.p.) in male C57BL/6J mice. Pitolisant was injected 30min before each cocaine-pairing session. Locomotion recorded on the first cocaine-pairing session was used to test the effects of Pitolisant on the locomotor effects of cocaine. Our results show that doses of Pitolisant higher than 10mg/kg depressed locomotion. When injected alone at doses that did not affect locomotion, Pitolisant (2.5-10mg/kg, i.p.) had no rewarding properties in the place conditioning technique. Additionally, Pitolisant did not significantly alter cocaine-induced hyperactivity and cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. Taken together, our study indicates that Pitolisant has no addictive properties alone. Moreover, this compound does not significantly affect the stimulant and rewarding effects of cocaine. These results add further evidence to support the hypothesis that a pharmacokinetic interaction is involved in the ability of thioperamide to potentiate cocaine's psychomotor effects.",

For this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial, we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 32 sleep disorder centres in five European countries. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had not taken psychostimulants for at least 14 days, and had EDS (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score of at least 14).

In vitro studies were performed using mouse bone marrow cells that were cultured with or without interleukin-1\u03b2, thapsigargin, or tacrolimus to induce osteoclast differentiation. A mouse model of arthritis was established by immunizing mice with bovine type II collagen. Tacrolimus was orally administered to mice from day 20 to 45 following the initial immunization, and histopathological changes and expression of specific biomarkers of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways were examined. In vitro, tacrolimus inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand-mediated osteoclast formation augmented by interleukin-1\u03b2, thapsigargin, or both. Furthermore, tacrolimus inhibited glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE 1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) augmented by interleukin-1\u03b2, thapsigargin, or both. Tacrolimus significantly ameliorated osteolysis and endoplasmic reticulum stress intensity in mice.

We previously reported that rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, activated autophagy and decreased proteasome inhibitor-mediated ubiquitinated protein accumulation, cytoplasmic inclusion body formation, and apoptosis in hepatocytes. Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide that has been shown to activate autophagy. It has been reported to decrease aggregate-prone proteins and ameliorate cytotoxicity in neurodegenerative disease models. However, the effects of trehalose in hepatocytes are unclear. We show here that trehalose activated autophagy and reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress, cytoplasmic inclusion body formation, and apoptosis in proteasome inhibitor-treated liver-derived cultured cells.

Here, we investigated the contribution of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), an ERSR signaling effector comprising the second arm of ERSR, in the pathogenesis of SCI. In contrast to what was seen after attenuation of PERK-CHOP signaling, genetic ablation of ATF6 results in modulation of ERSR and decreased survival in oligodendrocyte precursor cells against ER stress. Further, ATF6 loss delays the ERSR after SCI, potentiates PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling and fails to improve locomotor deficits. These data suggest that deleting ATF6 levels is unlikely to be a viable therapeutic target to improve functional recovery after SCI.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3300731": "The mechanisms of the responses of an enzyme to different hormones and metabolites or several enzymes to a single hormone are surprisingly varied. There is neither an operon for lipogenic enzymes nor a common step at which hormones and metabolites coordinately regulate the expression of lipogenic genes. In bacteria, coordinated expression of several enzymes in a single metabolic pathway often is achieved by organizing the genes into operons. An operon is a group of genes linked together in a linear fashion and producing a polycistronic mRNA. Trans-acting factors regulate the transcription of these genes by interacting with promoter/regulatory sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the most 5'-ward of the genes. In vertebrate animals, however, coordinated control of gene transcription is not achieved by linking the individual genes, but by putting in the 5'-flanking regions of these genes a regulatory sequence that interacts with common trans-acting factors. Genes controlled by different hormones are expected to have regulatory elements for each hormone. The presence of glucocorticoid and cyclic AMP regulatory elements at the 5'-end of the PEPCK gene is consistent with this notion. Transcription is not the only step at which hormones and metabolites control the pathways for gene expression. The levels of the mRNAs for L-PK, ME, S11, and S14 are increased by T3 at post-transcriptional steps. Glucagon also regulates the accumulation of ME mRNA post-transcriptionally. Neither the mechanism nor the sequence organization of regulatory elements is known for post-transcriptional control of gene expression. In the case of PEPCK and HMG-CoA reductase, the next steps will be to determine more precisely the sequences in the 5'-region that mediate hormone sensitivity and feedback inhibition, respectively, and whether trans-acting factors are involved. For the other genes discussed, identification of the regulated step must precede identification of sequences that confer hormone or metabolite-sensitive regulation on a specific gene. In general, it is probable that the hybrid gene approach, so successful for PEPCK and HMG-CoA reductase, also will be effective in defining cis-acting hormone- or metabolite-regulatory elements in other genes. These techniques should be applicable to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.

The gene organization agrees well with the accumulated observations indicating the coordinate synthesis of RNA polymerase and ribosomes under various growth conditions for wild-type E. coli cells. On the other hand, the differential regulation of the two essential components observed under restrictive growth conditions, after addition of various drugs or with certain mutants, in particular those carrying mutations in the RNA polymerase genes, was found to take place through two novel regulation systems: The transcriptional termination at an internal attenuation site and the two autogenous and posttranscriptional controls, being specific for the two ribosomal protein genes and the two RNA polymerase subunit genes, respectively. The majority of the transcription initiated from the promoter rpoP beta terminates at an attenuator site between the promoter-proximal rplJL and the promoter-distal rpoBC genes. The frequency of the attenuation seems to control the relative level of RNA polymerase synthesis to that of ribosomes. The expression of rpoBC genes is subject to an autogenous regulation, in which both RNA polymerase holoenzyme and alpha 2 beta complex function as regulatory molecules with repressor activity. The autogenous regulation was found to operate at post-transcriptional step(s), probably at the level of translation. During the study on the regulation of RNA polymerase synthesis, we noticed that the rpoBC operon contained another autogenous regulation circuit, in which the synthesis of L10 and L7/12 was specifically repressed by the L10-L7/12 complex.

To find the pathway through which the operon has been transferred, we sequenced the operon and both flanking regions in four typical luminous species. In Vibrio cholerae NCIMB 41, a five-gene cluster, most genes of which were highly similar to orthologues present in Gram-positive bacteria, along with the lux operon, is inserted between VC1560 and VC1563, on chromosome 1. Because this entire five-gene cluster is present in Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, about 1.5 Mbp upstream of the operon, we deduced that the operon and the gene cluster were transferred from V. cholerae to an ancestor of Pr. luminescens. Because in both V. fischeri and Shewanella hanedai, luxR and luxI were found just upstream of the operon, we concluded that the operon was transferred from either species to the other. Because most of the genes flanking the operon were highly similar to orthologues present on chromosome 2 of vibrios, we speculated that the operon of most species is located on this chromosome.

Among metazoans, operons have been extensively characterized in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which \u223c15% of the total genes are organized into operons. The most recent genome assembly for the ascidian Ciona intestinalis placed \u223c20% of the genes (2909 total) into 1310 operons. The majority of these operons are composed of two genes, while the largest are composed of six. Here is reported a computational analysis of the genes that comprise the Ciona operons. Gene ontology (GO) terms were identified for about two-thirds of the operon-encoded genes. Using the extensive collection of public EST libraries, estimates of temporal patterns of gene expression were generated for the operon-encoded genes. Lastly, conservation of operons was analyzed by determining how many operon-encoded genes were present in the ascidian Ciona savignyi and whether these genes were organized in orthologous operons. Over 68% of the operon-encoded genes could be assigned one or more GO terms and 697 of the 1310 operons contained genes in which all genes had at least one GO term. Of these 697 operons, GO terms were shared by all of the genes within 146 individual operons, suggesting that most operons encode genes with unrelated functions. An analysis of operon gene expression from nine different EST libraries indicated that for 587 operons, all of the genes that comprise an individual operon were expressed together in at least one EST library, suggesting that these genes may be co-regulated. About 50% (74/146) of the operons with shared GO terms also showed evidence of gene co-regulation. Comparisons with the C. savignyi genome identified orthologs for 1907 of 2909 operon genes. About 38% (504/1310) of the operons are conserved between the two Ciona species. These results suggest that like C. elegans, operons in Ciona are comprised of a variety of genes that are not necessarily related in function.

Genes that are part of the same operon often have related functional roles or participate in the same metabolic pathways. The majority of all bacterial genes are co-transcribed with one or more other genes as part of a multi-gene operon. Thus, accurate identification of operons is important in understanding co-regulation of genes and their functional relationships. Here, we present a computational system that uses RNA-seq data to determine operons throughout a genome. The system takes the name of a genome and one or more files of RNA-seq data as input. Our method combines primary genomic sequence information with expression data from the RNA-seq files in a unified probabilistic model in order to identify operons. We assess our method's ability to accurately identify operons in a range of species through comparison to external databases of operons, both experimentally confirmed and computationally predicted, and through focused experiments that confirm new operons identified by our method.

The support vector machine (SVM) approach is here used to predict operons at the genomic level. Four features were chosen as SVM input vectors: the intergenic distances, the number of common pathways, the number of conserved gene pairs and the mutual information of phylogenetic profiles. The analysis reveals that these common properties are indeed characteristic of the genes within operons and are different from that of non-operonic genes. Jackknife testing indicates that these input feature vectors, employed with RBF kernel SVM, achieve high accuracy. To validate the method, Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis were taken as benchmark genomes of known operon structure, and the prediction results in both show that the SVM can detect operon genes in target genomes efficiently and offers a satisfactory balance between sensitivity and specificity.",

Protein-coding operons have not been reported in the Fungi even though they represent a very diverse kingdom of organisms. Here, we report a functional operon involved in the secondary metabolism of the fungus Glarea lozoyensis belonging to Leotiomycetes (Ascomycota). Two contiguous genes, glpks3 and glnrps7, encoding polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase, respectively, are cotranscribed into one dicistronic mRNA under the control of the same promoter, and the mRNA is then translated into two individual proteins, GLPKS3 and GLNRPS7. Heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans shows that the GLPKS3-GLNRPS7 enzyme complex catalyzes the biosynthesis of a novel pyrrolidinedione-containing compound, xenolozoyenone (compound 1), which indicates the operon is functional. Although it is structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus has a monophylogenic origin from fungi rather than having been horizontally transferred from prokaryotes. Moreover, two additional operons, glpks28-glnrps8 and glpks29-glnrps9, were verified at the transcriptional level in the same fungus. This is the first report of protein-coding operons in a member of the Fungi. Operons are multigene transcriptional units which occur mostly in prokaryotes but rarely in eukaryotes. Three operon-like gene structures for secondary metabolism that were discovered in the filamentous fungus Glarea lozoyensis are the first examples of protein-coding operons identified in a member of the Fungi. Among them, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon is responsible for the biosynthesis of xenolozoyenone, which is a novel tetramic acid-containing compound. Although structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus did not result from horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes. In addition, operonlike structures have been predicted in silico to be common in other fungi.

They are found primarily in prokaryotic genomes. Because genes in the same operon are likely to have related functions, identification of the operon structure is potentially useful for assigning gene function. We report the development and benchmarking of two different methods for detecting operons, based on an analysis of 42 fully sequenced prokaryotic organisms. The Gene Neighbor method (GNM) utilizes the relatively high conservation of gene order in operons, compared with genes in general. The Gene Gap Method (GGM) makes use of the relatively short gap between genes in operons compared with that otherwise found between adjacent genes. The methods have been benchmarked using KEGG pathway data and RegulonDB Escherichia coli operon data. With optimum parameters, the specificity of the GNM is 93% and the sensitivity is 70%. For the GGM, the specificity is 95% and the sensitivity is 68%. Together, the two methods have a sensitivity of 87.2%, while joint predictions have a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 98%.

Operons are regulated multigene transcription units, in which polycistronic pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA coding for multiple peptides) is processed to monocistronic mRNAs. This occurs by 3' end formation and trans-splicing using the specialized SL2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle for downstream mRNAs. Previously, the correlation between downstream location in an operon and SL2 trans-splicing has been strong, but anecdotal. Although only 28 operons have been reported, the complete sequence of the C. elegans genome reveals numerous gene clusters. To determine how many of these clusters represent operons, we probed full-genome microarrays for SL2-containing mRNAs. We found significant enrichment for about 1,200 genes, including most of a group of several hundred genes represented by complementary DNAs that contain SL2 sequence. Analysis of their genomic arrangements indicates that &gt;90% are downstream genes, falling in 790 distinct operons. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes. Numerous examples of co-transcription of genes encoding functionally related proteins are evident. Inspection of the operon list should reveal previously unknown functional relationships.",

Recent work in nematodes has demonstrated that the identity of genes within operons is highly conserved among species and that the unifying feature of genes within operons is that they are expressed in germline tissue. However, it is generally unknown what processes are responsible for generating the distribution of operon sizes across the genome, which are composed of up to eight genes per operon. Here we investigate several models for operon evolution to better understand their abundance, distribution of sizes, and evolutionary dynamics over time. We find that birth-death models of operon evolution reasonably describe the relative abundance of operons of different sizes in the C. elegans and Ciona genomes and generate predictions about the number of monocistronic, nonoperon genes that likely participate in the birth-death process. This theory, and applications to C. elegans and Ciona, motivates several new and testable hypotheses about eukaryote operon evolution.",

Operons are present in the class Chromadorea, one of the two main nematode classes, but their distribution in the other class, the Enoplea, is not known. We have surveyed the genomes of Trichinella spiralis, Trichuris muris, and Romanomermis culicivorax and identified the first putative operons in members of the Enoplea. Consistent with the mechanism of polycistronic RNA resolution in other nematodes, the mRNAs produced by genes downstream of the first gene in the T. spiralis and T. muris operons are trans-spliced to spliced leader RNAs, and we are able to detect polycistronic RNAs derived from these operons. Importantly, a putative intercistronic region from one of these potential enoplean operons confers polycistronic processing activity when expressed as part of a chimeric operon in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that T. spiralis genes located in operons have an increased likelihood of having operonic C. elegans homologs. However, operon structure in terms of synteny and gene content is not tightly conserved between the two taxa, consistent with models of operon evolution. We have nevertheless identified putative operons conserved between Enoplea and Chromadorea.

However, despite the resemblance to a bacterial operon, this gene cluster has been assembled from plant genes by gene duplication, neofunctionalization, and genome reorganization, rather than by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. Furthermore, recent assembly of operon-like gene clusters for triterpene synthesis has occurred independently in divergent plant lineages (Arabidopsis and oat).

Although this locus encodes three well-characterized tumor suppressors, p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), and ARF, the SNPs most strongly associated with ASVD are \u223c120 kb from the nearest coding gene within a long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) known as ANRIL (CDKN2BAS). While individuals homozygous for the atherosclerotic risk allele show decreased expression of ANRIL and the coding INK4/ARF transcripts, the mechanism by which such distant genetic variants influence INK4/ARF expression is unknown. Here, using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and analysis of next-generation RNA sequencing datasets, we determined the structure and abundance of multiple ANRIL species. Each of these species was present at very low copy numbers in primary and cultured cells; however, only the expression of ANRIL isoforms containing exons proximal to the INK4/ARF locus correlated with the ASVD risk alleles. Surprisingly, RACE also identified transcripts containing non-colinear ANRIL exonic sequences, whose expression also correlated with genotype and INK4/ARF expression. These non-polyadenylated RNAs resisted RNAse R digestion and could be PCR amplified using outward-facing primers, suggesting they represent circular RNA structures that could arise from by-products of mRNA splicing. Next-generation DNA sequencing and splice prediction algorithms identified polymorphisms within the ASVD risk interval that may regulate ANRIL splicing and circular ANRIL (cANRIL) production. These results identify novel circular RNA products emanating from the ANRIL locus and suggest causal variants at 9p21.3 regulate INK4/ARF expression and ASVD risk by modulating ANRIL expression and/or structure.",

The activity of circular ribozymes is comparable to the linear counterparts with similar core sequences. Circular forms of the TAR and Rev-binding element showed specific binding to Tfr-38 and Rev(35-50) peptide, respectively. To explore the potential for using this methodology to express circular RNA in vivo, circular forms of the HDV ribozyme and RNaseP RNA were produced in E. coli. Analysis of total RNA indicated that the precursor RNA spliced efficiently and accurately to produce circular ribozymes.

In the current study, we successfully established the miR-145-overexpressed prostate cancer LNCaP cells (LNCaP-miR-145) using lentiviral vectors. LNCaP cells expressing the empty vector (LNCaP-NC) were used as the negative control. The circRNA expression in LNCaP-miR-145 cells was detected by microarray analysis, and the miRNA targets of circRNAs were predicted using the bioinformatics software TargetScan and miRanda. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of circRNAs in the prostate cancer tissue, nonmalignant tissue, LNCaP-miR-145 cells, and LNCaP-NC cells. The interaction of miRNA and circRNA was further confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. A total of 267 and 149 circRNAs were significantly up- and downregulated in LNCaP-miR-145 cells, respectively. hsa_circRNA_101981, hsa_circRNA_101996 and hsa_circRNA_09142 were the 3 circRNAs that interacted with hsa-miR-145-5p; hsa_circRNA_008068 and hsa_circRNA_406557 were the 2 circRNAs that interacted with hsa-miR-145-3p.

They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization. Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and relatively stable in the cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential functions to circRNAs, such as acting as miRNA sponges, or binding to RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene transcription. It has been proposed that circRNA regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level by interacting with miRNAs and that circRNAs may have a role in regulating miRNA function in cancer initiation and progression. circRNAs appear to be more often downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue and this may be due to (i) errors in the back-splice machinery in malignant tissues, (ii) degradation of circRNAs by deregulated miRNAs in tumor tissue, or (iii) increasing cell proliferation leading to a reduction of circRNAs. circRNAs have been identified in exosomes and more recently, chromosomal translocations in cancer have been shown to generate aberrant fusion-circRNAs associated with resistance to drug treatments. In addition, though originally thought to be non-coding, there is now increasing evidence to suggest that select circRNAs can be translated into functional proteins.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of the MAGE-A3 cancer immunotherapeutic in surgically resected NSCLC. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients aged at least 18 years with completely resected stage IB, II, and IIIA MAGE-A3-positive NSCLC who did or did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy from 443 centres in 34 countries (Europe, the Americas, and Asia Pacific). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 13 intramuscular injections of recMAGE-A3 with AS15 immunostimulant (MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic) or placebo during 27 months. Randomisation and treatment allocation at the investigator site was done centrally via internet with stratification for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. A minimisation algorithm accounted for the number of chemotherapy cycles received, disease stage, lymph node sampling procedure, performance status score, and lifetime smoking status. The primary endpoint was broken up into three co-primary objectives: disease-free survival in the overall population, the no-chemotherapy population, and patients with a potentially predictive gene signature.

Patients with RA had the following characteristics: mean disease duration of 12 years, Disease Activity Score for 28 joints of 3.44, and Sharp-van der Heijde score of 57.5. Ten of the 19 RA patients showed high titers of ACPAs in their sera. Four of the seropositive (40%), none of the seronegative RA patients, and only 1 of the control subjects showed detectable levels of ACPAs in their sputum. The ratio between the reactivity with CitP and NorP peptides in the sputum was significantly higher in RA sputum than in control sputum (1.33 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 0.64 \u00b1 0.14, P = 0.02). A positive correlation was found between sputum ACPAs and age, serum ACPAs, sputum anti-NorP, serum anti-CitP/NorP reactivity ratio, and the proportion of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the sputum. No significant correlation was found between sputum ACPAs and disease severity, history of smoking, lung function tests, or treatment for RA. Anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies can be detected in the sputum of RA patients and are correlated with the presence in the serum.",

ACPA testing has become a routine tool for RA diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, treatment efficacy has been shown to vary by ACPA-positive status. However, it is not clear if the economic burden of patients with RA varies by ACPA status. To determine if the economic burden of RA varies by patient ACPA status. IMS PharMetrics Plus health insurance claims and electronic medical record (EMR) data from 2010-2015 were used to identify patients with incident RA. Patients were aged \u2265 18 years, had \u2265 1 inpatient or \u2265 2 outpatient claims reporting an RA diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM code 714.0), and had an anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP; a surrogate of ACPA) antibody test within 6 months of diagnosis. Incident patients were defined as those who had no claims with an RA diagnosis code in the 6 months before the first observed RA diagnosis. The primary outcome of interest was RA-related medical expenditures, defined as the sum of payer- and patient-paid amounts for all claims with an RA diagnosis code. Secondary outcomes included health care utilization metrics such as treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and physician visits. Generalized linear regression models were used for each outcome, controlling for ACPA-positive status (defined as anti-CCP \u2265 20 AU/mL), age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score as explanatory variables. Of 647,171 patients diagnosed with RA, 89,296 were incident cases, and 47% (n = 42,285) had an anti-CCP test. After restricting this sample to patients with a linked EMR and reported anti-CCP test result, 859 remained, with 24.7% (n = 212) being ACPA-positive. Compared with ACPA-negative patients, adjusted results showed that ACPA-positive patients were more likely to use either conventional (71.2% vs. 49.6%; P &lt; 0.001) or biologic (20.3% vs. 11.8%; P &lt; 0.001) DMARDs during the first year after diagnosis and had more physician visits (5.58 vs. 3.91 times per year; P &lt; 0.001). Annual RA-associated total expenditures were $7,941 for ACPA-positive and $5,243 for ACPA-negative patients (\u0394 = $2,698; P = 0.002). RA-associated medical expenditures were $4,380 for ACPA-positive and $3,427 for ACPA-negative patients (\u0394 = $954; P = 0.168), whereas DMARD expenditures were $3,560 and $1,817, respectively (\u0394 = $1,743; P = 0.001). RA-related economic burden is higher for patients who are ACPA-positive compared with those who are ACPA-negative. Providers may wish to inform patients diagnosed with ACPA-positive RA about the likely future disease and economic burden in hopes that both stakeholders can be more proactive in addressing them.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27755123": " This article reviews recent literature on the origin and pathogenic role of anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ACPAs and ACPA-immune complexes interact with immune cells to facilitate articular inflammation. Findings from recent in vitro and in vivo studies are congruent with epidemiologic observations in RA supporting a pathogenic role of ACPAs. ACPAs target proteins/peptides with citrullinated epitopes and serve as informative RA biomarkers. ACPAs are generated within synovium and possibly at extra-articular sites prior to disease onset. Proximate to RA onset, critical qualitative and quantitative changes to ACPAs occur that drive proinflammatory responses. Unable to induce arthritis alone, the administration of ACPAs enhances the development and severity of inflammation in mice when a mild synovitis is already present. In vitro studies have elucidated several possible mechanisms linking ACPA to disease progression including: first, activation of inflammatory cells by ACPA-immune complexes; second, ACPA-mediated neutrophil cell death producing neutrophil extracellular traps, which drives inflammation and autoimmunity by releasing citrullinated autoantigen; and finally, direct binding of ACPAs to osteoclasts and resulting osteoclastogenesis. Together, these recent investigations have begun to elucidate the different mechanisms by which ACPAs may be directly pathogenic in RA.",

Serum samples were assayed by ELISA for the presence of anticyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) antibodies and four different ACPA fine specificities. Cross-reactivity between ACPAs was examined by peptide absorption experiments. Genotyping was performed for HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles and the PTPN22 gene, while information regarding smoking was obtained by questionnaire. The association of genetic and environmental risk factors with different subsets of RA was calculated by logistic regression analysis. Limited cross-reactivity was observed between different ACPA fine specificities. In total, 17 RA subsets could be identified based on their different ACPA fine specificity profiles. Large differences in association with genetic and environmental determinants were observed between subsets. The strongest association of HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and smoking was identified for the RA subset which was defined by the presence of antibodies to citrullinated \u03b1-enolase and vimentin. This study provides the most comprehensive picture to date of how HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and smoking are associated with the presence of specific ACPA reactivities rather than anti-CCP levels. The new data will form a basis for molecular studies aimed at understanding disease development in serologically distinct subsets of RA.",

Citrullinated proteins are observed in RA lung tissues; however, the association of specific anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) with ILD in RA is unknown. RA patients underwent multidetector CT (MDCT) of the chest, from which ILD features and a semiquantitative ILD Score (ILDS; range 0-32) were assessed. Anti-CCP (CCP2) and levels of a panel of antibodies against 17 citrullinated and four non-citrullinated peptides were assessed from concurrent serum samples using a custom Bio-Plex bead array. High level ACPA was defined as \u2265the group 75th percentile. Among the 177 RA patients studied, median levels of CCP2 and all specific ACPAs were 46-273% higher among RA patients with versus those without ILD (all p values &lt;0.05), and higher levels correlated with higher ILDS. In contrast, levels of non-citrullinated protein antibodies were not higher in those with ILD. RA patients had a median of 2 high level ACPA reactivities (range 0-16), with each high level ACPA associated, on average, with a 0.10 unit higher ILDS (p=0.001). This association remained significant after adjusting for characteristics associated with ILD (age, gender, current and former smoking, Disease Activity Score for 28 joints, current prednisone and leflunomide use). More high level ACPA were observed in those with versus without pulmonary function restriction or impaired diffusion. Our findings of a broader ACPA repertoire in RA ILD suggest a possible role for ACPA in the pathogenesis of ILD.",

This longitudinal study investigated (1) progression from CSA to clinically detectable arthritis and (2) associations of clinical factors, serological factors (among which are anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs)) and MRI-detected subclinical inflammation with arthritis development. 150 patients with CSA were followed for \u22656 months. At baseline, clinical and serological data were collected and unilateral 1.5 T-MRI of metacarpophalangeal (MCP), wrist and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints was made. MRI scoring was done according to the RA MRI scoring system. Subclinical MRI inflammation was defined based on MRI results of 193 symptom-free persons. During follow-up (median=75 weeks, IQR=41-106 weeks), 30 patients developed clinical arthritis; 87% did so &lt;20 weeks after inclusion. In multivariable analyses, age, localisation of initial symptoms in small and large joints (compared with small joints only), C-reactive protein level, ACPA-positivity and subclinical MRI inflammation significantly associated with arthritis development; ACPA and MRI inflammation were most strongly associated (HR (95% CI) respectively, 6.43 (2.57 to 16.05) and 5.07 (1.77 to 14.50)). After 1-year follow-up, 31% of the patients with MRI inflammation and 71% of the ACPA-positive patients with MRI inflammation had progressed to arthritis. Forty-three per cent of the patients that developed arthritis within 1 year were ACPA-negative; 78% of them had subclinical MRI inflammation at baseline. When MRI inflammation was absent arthritis development was infrequent (6% in all patients with CSA and 3% in ACPA-negative patients with CSA). Subclinical MRI inflammation precedes clinical arthritis with a few months. Subclinical MRI inflammation is, independent of other factors such as ACPA, associated with arthritis development.",

This paper reviews the evidence for the use of ACPAs as a screening test in the broader general population, to identify individuals at high risk of subsequent onset of RA.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24206219": "Anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) constitute a class of autoantibodies found in 60-70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The most common test for ACPA positivity is based on the occurrence of antibodies that bind to circular citrullinated peptides, so-called CCP, some of which are derived from endogenously citrullinated proteins, like filaggrin. Several lines of evidence suggest that these autoantibodies may confer pathological reactions. They appear years before onset of clinical disease and are associated with worse prognosis and a more erosive disease. Their presence correlates with the most prominent genetic risk factors for RA development, and they were recently described to mediate relevant biological functions such as activation of complement system and induction of osteoclastogenesis. The development of new drugs that specifically target these autoantibodies is an appealing and novel approach. Herein, we briefly review the autoimmune condition of RA, characterized by the presence of ACPA, and we describe how the neutralization of autoantibodies might become a novel pharmacological principle.",

Still, many features of these antibodies, including their site of production and the extent of MHC class II-driven T cell help, remain unclarified. To address these questions, we have used a single B cell-based cloning technology to isolate and express immunoglobulin (Ig) genes from joint-derived B cells of active RA patients. We found \u223c25% of synovial IgG-expressing B cells to be specific for citrullinated autoantigens in the investigated ACPA(+) RA patients, whereas such antibodies were not found in ACPA(-) patients. The citrulline-reactive monoclonal antibodies did not react with the unmodified arginine peptides, yet several reacted with more than one citrullinated antigen. A role for active antigen selection of the citrulline-reactive synovial B cells was supported by the strong bias toward amino acid replacement mutations in ACPA(+) antibodies and by their loss of reactivity to citrullinated autoantigens when somatic mutations were reverted to the corresponding germline sequences.",

Despite similarities between RA and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the prevalence of ACPA in polyarticular JIA is low. We wanted to evaluate the influence of age, disease duration and total immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration on ACPA positivity in this cohort. Patients with JIA were classified according to age and International League of Associations for Rheumatology classification. Sixty-one JIA patients aged less than 16 yr were included and classified as polyarticular JIA (poly JIA &lt;16; n=23) or non-polyarticular JIA (n=38). In addition, a group of 21 polyarticular JIA patients, aged more than 16 yr (poly JIA &gt;16) and a group of 51 RA patients were included. Antibodies to the synthetic citrullinated peptides pepA and pepB were detected by line immunoassay and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP2) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgG was measured by fixed-time immunonephelometry. No ACPA reactivity was observed in the non-polyarticular group. In poly JIA &lt;16, only 1/23 had anti-CCP2 antibody, whereas in poly JIA &gt;16 patients a significantly higher fraction was detected (6/21). All but one of the anti-CCP2 reactive patients were rheumatoid factor (RF) positive. Assessing anti-CCP2 antibody concentration as a continuous variable, significantly higher titres were found in poly JIA &gt;16 compared with poly JIA &lt;16. No correlation between anti-CCP2 concentration and total IgG was detected. Four patients demonstrated immunoreactivity against pepA and pepB; all of them were anti-CCP2 reactive, poly JIA &gt;16 patients. ACPA are present in low prevalence in polyarticular JIA and are particularly found in the RF-positive subset.

The clinical significance of ACPA in patients with antisynthetase syndrome (ASS), a systemic disease characterized by the association of myositis, interstitial lung disease, polyarthralgia, and/or polyarthritis, has not yet been evaluated with regard to phenotype, prognosis, and response to treatment. ACPA-positive ASS patients were first identified among a French multicenter registry of patients with ASS. Additionally, all French rheumatology and internal medicine practitioners registered on the Club Rhumatismes et Inflammation web site were asked to report their observations of ASS patients with ACPA. The 17 collected patients were retrospectively studied using a standardized questionnaire and compared with 34 unselected ACPA-negative ASS patients in a case-control study. All ACPA-positive ASS patients suffered from arthritis versus 41% in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001).

Three diagnostic citrullinated peptides-viral citrullinated peptide 1 (VCP1) and VCP2 derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded proteins and histone citrullinated peptide 1 (HCP1) derived from histone H4-were synthesized as tetrameric multiple antigen peptides and immobilized on sensor chips CM5 type in a Biacore T100 instrument. Specific binding of purified antibodies from RA patients to the three peptides was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using two arginine-containing sequences as controls. Employing a 1:1 binding model for affinity constant calculation, ACPAs interacted with VCP1 and VCP2 with lower apparent affinity (10(-6) M&gt;KD&gt;10(-7) M) and interacted with HCP1 with higher apparent affinity (KD=10(-8) M). The results indicate that the binding to citrullinated peptides is characterized by wide differences in affinity, with slower association and faster dissociation rates in the case of antibodies to viral citrullinated peptides as compared with antibodies specific for the histone peptide.

The aim of this work is to evaluate in a retrospective study the clinico-serological association of ACPA detected using VCP1 and VCP2 (EBV-derived citrullinated peptides) and HCP1 and HCP2 (histone-H4-derived citrulinated peptides) in established RA. In 413 RA patients, anti-VCP1, -VCP2, -HCP1, -HCP2 were measured by ELISA. Patients were evaluated for systemic involvement, disease activity/severity, ongoing and past therapies. Data were analyzed by cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Anti-VCP1 were detected in 44% of RA patients; anti-VCP2 in 52%; anti-HCP1 in 46% and anti-HCP2 in 63%. CA and PCA independently demonstrated that ACPA levels are associated with RF positivity, and lung involvement. Subdividing patients in 5 groups according to the number of anti-peptide antibodies, mean antibody level and RF positivity, as well as the frequency of lung involvement, progressively increase in parallel with the number of ACPA specificities. Higher number/levels of ACPA subtypes is associated with lung involvement but not with erosive disease.

Citrulline modification is very similar to a different modified amino acid, homocitrulline. We investigated antihomocitrullinated protein/ peptide antibody (AHCPA) specificity for RA, whether ACPA were also able to bind homocitrullinated targets, and whether the SE could accommodate homocitrullinated peptide. Homocitrullinated fibrinogen was used to screen sera from patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, and healthy subjects for AHCPA using ELISA. Homocitrullination sites on fibrinogen were identified by mass spectrometry. ACPA were affinity-purified using a synthetic citrullinated peptide and tested for binding to homocitrullinated protein/peptide. Inhibition of antihomocitrullinated fibrinogen antibody binding was examined. Homocitrullinated peptide interaction with the SE was studied using computer modeling. IgG antihomocitrullinated fibrinogen antibodies were found specifically in 49% of patients with RA. Enrichment of ACPA by affinity purification from 5 patients with RA also enriched AHCPA. Serum AHCPA was inhibited by citrullinated fibrinogen and more significantly by homocitrullinated fibrinogen. Computer modeling indicated that the SE could accommodate a homocitrullinated peptide without steric hindrance. Mass spectrometry identified that 89/103 lysines of fibrinogen could be homocitrullinated, and 5 peptides that could be both citrullinated and homocitrullinated and are predicted to bind the SE. Antihomocitrullinated fibrinogen antibodies are specific to RA. The presence of AHCPA coincides with ACPA, and AHCPA copurifies with ACPA in affinity purification and is inhibited by citrullinated and homocitrullinated antigens. Thus AHCPA and ACPA are frequently cross-reactive and homocitrullinated proteins/peptides may bind the SE.",

In this study, we analyzed the reactivity of ACPA to various citrullinated peptides by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, in order to determine the dependency of specific amino acids for antibody reactivity. A non-human protein (ovalbumin) and antigens directly related to RA were used as templates for synthesis of non-modified and citrullinated peptides, becoming potential target epitopes. Mainly peptides containing a Cit-Gly motif were recognized by ACPAs, while no particular amino acids N-terminal of citrulline were found to be essential for antibody reactivity. Moreover, ACPA reactivity was not restricted to antigens known to be associated with ACPA-positive RA alone, but also to proteins without relation to RA, primarily illustrating that any protein in theory can be turned into an RA autoantigen, by introducing Cit-Gly motifs. Knowledge about the interaction between ACPAs and their citrullinated targets is important for understanding autoimmune ACPA responses in RA, which are known to contribute to the pathophysiology.",

However, studies evaluating the association between anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) and imaging measures of atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been limited to seroreactive citrullinated fibrinogen or citrullinated vimentin and have rendered contradictory results. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate this association using an extended panel of ACPAs in a larger sample of RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). ACPAs were identified using a custom Bio-Plex bead assay in 270 patients from 2 independent RA cohorts without clinical CVD, with the first one consisting of 195 patients and the other of 75 patients. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) was assessed by computed tomography as a measure of coronary artery disease. High levels of anti-citrullinated histone H2B antibodies were strongly associated with higher CAC scores, compared with lower antibody levels (P = 0.001); this remained significant after adjustment for traditional CV and RA-specific risk factors (P = 0.03). No association between levels of ACPAs and CAC progression at 3 years was seen (P = 0.09); however, the number of progressors was small (n = 92). Higher levels of ACPAs targeting Cit-histone H2B were associated with higher CAC scores when compared to lower antibody levels, suggesting a potential role for histone citrullination seroreactivity in atherosclerosis.",

Cytokine treatment or fungal infection induced upregulation of C/EBPbeta but not C/EBPalpha or C/EBPepsilon transcripts in granulocyte progenitors, and C/EBPbeta-deficient progenitors showed decreased emergency-induced granulopoiesis in vitro and in vivo.

Neutrophils isolated from the airways of lung transplantation recipients stimulate donor DCs in a contact-dependent fashion to augment their production of IL-12 and expand alloantigen-specific IFN-\u03b3(+) T cells. DC IL-12 expression is largely regulated by degranulation and induced by TNF-\u03b1 associated with the neutrophil plasma membrane. Extended cold ischemic graft storage enhances G-CSF-mediated granulopoiesis and neutrophil graft infiltration, resulting in exacerbation of ischemia-reperfusion injury after lung transplantation.

After the induction of candidemia, rapid mobilization of mature granulocytes and an increase in early granulocyte precursors accompanied by cell cycle acceleration was followed by a gradual increase in granulocytes originating from the immature populations. Upon infection, C/EBP\u03b2 was upregulated at the protein level in all the granulopoietic subpopulations. The rapid increase in immature subpopulations #1 and #2 observed in C/EBP\u03b2 knockout mice at 1 d postinfection was attenuated.

It is characterized by the rapid expansion and differentiation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitor (GMP) populations, which is due in part to a shortened S-phase of the cell cycle. We found that IRF8 (also known as ICSBP), an interferon regulatory transcription factor that activates phagocyte effector genes during the innate immune response, activates the gene encoding Fanconi C (Fancc) in murine myeloid progenitor cells. Moreover, IRF8-induced Fancc transcription was augmented by treatment with IL-1\u03b2, an essential cytokine for emergency granulopoiesis. The Fanconi pathway participates in repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks during DNA replication, leading us to hypothesize that the Fanconi pathway contributes to genomic stability during emergency granulopoiesis. In support of this hypothesis, Fancc(-/-) mice developed anemia and neutropenia during repeated, failed episodes of emergency granulopoiesis. Failed emergency granulopoiesis in Fancc(-/-) mice was associated with excess apoptosis of HSCs and progenitor cells in the bone marrow and impaired HSC function.

Using tissue-specific myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88)-deficient mice and in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to model severe bacterial infection, we here show that endothelial cells (ECs) but not hematopoietic cells, hepatocytes, pericytes, or BM stromal cells, are essential cells for this process. Indeed, ECs from multiple tissues including BM express high levels of Tlr4 and Myd88 and are the primary source of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the key granulopoietic cytokine, after LPS challenge or infection with Escherichia coli. EC-intrinsic MYD88 signaling and subsequent G-CSF production by ECs is required for myeloid progenitor lineage skewing toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, increased colony-forming unit granulocyte activity in BM, and accelerated BM neutrophil generation after LPS stimulation. Thus, ECs catalyze the detection of systemic infection into demand-adapted granulopoiesis.",

Mice with bone marrow-specific disruption of the ARIH2 gene exhibit constitutive inflammation with tissue infiltration by granulocytes and B cells. In contrast, disruption of the HOXA10 gene in mice neither constitutively activates the innate immune response nor significantly alters steady-state granulopoiesis. This study explores the impact of HoxA10-induced Triad1 expression on emergency (stress) granulopoiesis. We found that mice with HOXA10 gene disruption exhibited an overwhelming and fatal emergency granulopoiesis response that was characterized by tissue infiltration with granulocytes, but reversed by re-expression of Triad1 in the bone marrow. We determined that HoxA9 repressed ARIH2 transcription in myeloid progenitor cells, antagonizing the effect of HoxA10 on Triad1 expression. Also, we found that differentiation-stage-specific ARIH2 transcription was regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation states of HoxA9 and HoxA10. Our studies demonstrate a previously undescribed role for HoxA10 in terminating emergency granulopoiesis, suggesting an important contribution by Hox proteins to the innate immune response.",

However, the consequences of G-CSF stimulation on the transcriptome of neutrophils and their precursors have not yet been investigated in humans. In this work, we examine the changes in mRNA expression induced by administration of G-CSF in vivo, as a model of emergency granulopoiesis in humans. Blood samples were collected from healthy individuals after 5 d of G-CSF administration. Neutrophil precursors were sorted into discrete stages of maturation by flow cytometry, and RNA was subjected to microarray analysis. mRNA levels were compared with previously published expression levels in corresponding populations of neutrophil precursors isolated from bone marrow of untreated, healthy individuals. One thousand one hundred and ten mRNAs were differentially expressed &gt;2-fold throughout terminal granulopoiesis. Major changes were seen in pathways involved in apoptosis, cytokine signaling, and TLR pathways. In addition, G-CSF treatment reduced the levels of four of five measured granule proteins in mature neutrophils, including the proantibacterial protein hCAP-18, which was completely deficient in neutrophils from G-CSF-treated donors. These results indicate that multiple biological processes are altered to satisfy the increased demand for neutrophils during G-CSF-induced emergency granulopoiesis in humans.",

We have identified that Pax9, which is an essential regulator for odontogenesis and palatogenesis, is selectively localized within a single cluster of the hematopoietic lineage. To further analyze the function of Pax9 in hematopoiesis, we generated two independent pax9 knock-out mutants using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. We found that Pax9 appears to be an essential regulator for granulopoiesis but dispensable for erythropoiesis during development, as lack of pax9 selectively decreased the number of neutrophils with a concomitant decrease in the expression level of neutrophil markers. In addition, embryos, where pax9 was functionally disrupted by injecting morpholinos, failed to increase the number of neutrophils in response to pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that Pax9 is not only essential for developmental granulopoiesis but also emergency granulopoiesis. Due to the inability to initiate emergency granulopoiesis, innate immune responses were severely compromised in pax9 morpholino-mediated embryos, increasing their susceptibility and mortality.

Analysis of this specific impairment revealed an unanticipated role for IL-1RI in supporting increased proliferation by granulocyte/macrophage progenitors and, surprisingly, multipotent progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Indeed, HSC and multipotent progenitor proliferative responses were most suppressed in IL-1RI(-/-) mice, suggesting a critical role for their proliferation in inflammatory granulopoiesis.

Cervical cancer patients treated with radiotherapy, but not those who did not receive radiotherapy, were at increased risk for all second cancers and cancers at heavily irradiated sites (colon, rectum/anus, urinary bladder, ovary, and genital sites) beyond 40 years of follow-up compared with women in the general population. The association of radiotherapy with second cancer risk was modified by age at cervical cancer diagnosis for rectum/anus, genital sites, and urinary bladder, with higher hazard ratios for second cancer at younger ages of cervical cancer. After adjustment for competing mortality, the 40-year cumulative risk of any second cancer was higher among women diagnosed with cervical cancer before age 50 (22.2%; 95% CI = 21.5% to 22.8%) than among women diagnosed after age 50 (16.4%; 95% CI = 16.1% to 16.9%). Cervical cancer patients treated with radiotherapy are at increased risk of second cancers at sites in close proximity to the cervix beyond 40 years of follow-up.",

Relatively little is understood about their influence on human immune responses. Herein, we discovered a novel and important mechanism whereby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) blunt human B-cell antibody production. We demonstrate that the Cox-2 selective small molecule inhibitors SC-58125 and NS-398 attenuate the production of human antibody isotypes including immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. In addition, inhibition of Cox-2 significantly reduced the generation of CD38+ IgM+ and CD38+ IgG+ antibody-secreting cells. Interestingly, we discovered that inhibition of Cox-2 activity in normal human B cells severely reduced the messenger RNA and protein levels of the essential plasma cell transcription factor, Blimp-1. These observations were mirrored in Cox-2-deficient mice, which had reduced CD138+ plasma cells and a near loss of Blimp-1 expression. These new findings demonstrate a critical role for Cox-2 in the terminal differentiation of human B lymphocytes to antibody-secreting plasma cells. The use of NSAIDs may adversely influence the efficacy of vaccines, especially in the immunocompromised, elderly and when vaccines are weakly immunogenic.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157351": "Human immunoglobulin D (IgD) occurs most abundantly as a membrane-bound antibody on the surface of mature B cells (mIgD). IgD possesses the longest hinge sequence of all the human antibody isotypes, with 64 residues connecting the Fab and Fc fragments. A novel rapid purification scheme of secreted IgD from the serum of an IgD myeloma patient using thiophilic (T-gel) and lectin affinity chromatography gave a stable, homogeneous IgD preparation. Synchrotron X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation of IgD identified the solution arrangement of its Fab and Fc fragments, and thereby its hinge structure. The Guinier X-ray radius of gyration R(G) of 6.9(+/-0.1)nm showed that IgD is more extended in solution than the immunoglobulin subclass IgA1 (R(G) of 6.1-6.2nm). Its distance distribution function P(r) showed a single peak at 4.7nm and a maximum dimension of 23nm. Velocity experiments gave a sedimentation coefficient of 6.3S, which is similar to that for IgA1 at 6.2S. The complete IgD structure was modelled using molecular dynamics to generate IgD hinge structures, to which homology models for the Fab and Fc fragments were connected. Good scattering curve fits were obtained with 18 semi-extended best fit IgD models that were filtered from 8500 trial models. These best-fit models showed that the IgD hinge does not correspond to an extended polypeptide structure. The averaged solution structure arrangement of the Fab and Fc fragments in IgD is principally T-shaped and flexible, with contribution from Y-shaped and inverted Y-shaped structures. Although the linear sequence of the IgD hinge is much longer, comparison with previous scattering modelling of IgA1 and IgA2(m)1 suggests that the hinge of IgA1 and IgD are more similar than might have been expected, Both possess flexible T-shaped solution structures, probably reflecting the presence of restraining O-linked sugars.",

Experimental studies suggest regulatory functions of vitamin D on B cells. However, only a few human studies, with considerable methodological limitations, have been conducted within this field. Our objective was to investigate whether higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were inversely associated with \u03b2-cell autoantigens glutamic acid decarboxylase (isoform 65) (GADA) and insulinoma-associated antigen-2A (IA-2A). Further, we also wanted to examine the relationship between 25(OH)D and total antibody concentrations. We randomly selected 500 patients with newly diagnosed T1D and 500 siblings for 25(OH)D, antibody and genetic analysis from the population-based Danish Registry of Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes. The relative change (RC) in the mean concentration of GADA, IA-2A and antibody isotypes by a 10 nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D concentration was modelled by a robust log-normal regression model. We found no association between 25(OH)D and GADA [adjusted RC per 10 nmol/l increase: 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.02] and IA-2A [adjusted RC per 10 nmol/l increase: 0.92; CI: 0.76-1.12]. Further, 25(OH)D was not associated with the total concentration of antibody isotypes [immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgE, IgG and IgM]. All null findings were unaltered after adjustment for genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway. Physiological concentrations of 25(OH)D are unlikely to have a clinically important effect on antibody concentrations in a paediatric population of newly diagnosed patients with T1D and their healthy siblings.",

A method to rapidly produce these anti-cancer autoantibodies in the lab would be valuable for understanding immune events and to generate candidate reagents for therapy and diagnostics. The purpose of this report is to evaluate sentinel nodes (SNs) of breast cancer patients as a source of anti-cancer antibodies. Radiotracer lymphatic mapping in 29 patients with breast cancer confirmed the identity of the SNs which provided source cells for this study. Flow cytometry demonstrated ~28% of the MNCs were B cells and ~44% of the B cells were class switched memory B cells. EBV-induced proliferation of B cells yielded tumor binding antibodies from 3 wells per 1000 but cultures were too unstable for detailed evaluations. Hybridomas generated by electrofusion produced IgG (48%), IgM (34%) and IgA (18%) antibody isotypes which were screened for binding to a panel of breast cancer cells of the major molecular subtypes. Tumor lysate binding was observed in 28% of the hybridoma clones and 10% of these bound whole tumor cells with unique binding patterns. More detailed evaluation of selected clones showed binding to the patient's own tumor. SNs are removed from more than 100,000 breast cancer patients in the US per year.

We characterized the antibody responses to DENV NS1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a longitudinal cohort of 266 confirmed dengue cases in Recife, Northeast Brazil. Samples were collected during the febrile phase and up to over 3 years after onset of symptoms. The antibodies investigated [IgA, IgM, total IgG (all subclasses measured together) and each subclass (IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) measured separately] had distinct kinetic profiles following primary or secondary DENV infections. Of interest, most of these antibodies were consistently detected greater than 6 months after onset of symptoms, except for IgG3. Anti-dengue NS1-specific IgG was consistently detected from the acute phase to beyond 3 years after symptom onset. In contrast, anti-dengue NS1-specific IgG3 was detected within the first week, peaked at week 2-3, and disappeared within 4-6 months after onset of symptoms. The mean duration of the IgG3 positive signal was 149 days (ranging from 126 to 172 days). In conclusion, anti-dengue NS1-specific IgG and IgG3 are potential biomarkers of long-term and recent (less than 6 months) DENV infections, respectively.",

Two known major causes are ischemic optic neuropathy and central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). Traditional understanding of CRAO has been consistently related to occurrence of periocular trauma and signs of increased intraorbital pressure in addition to visual loss. However, such orbital signs are not a feature of any common perioperative visual loss syndrome. A 55-year-old woman underwent prolonged lumbar decompression and fusion for spinal stenosis under general anesthesia in the prone position. At the end of surgery, periocular hyperemia, corneal edema, and a tense orbit on the right side were noted. Complete internal and external ophthalmoplegia was observed on examination. Orbital computed tomography confirmed the clinical diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome. Bony decompression was performed, but the treated eye remained blind. Resolution of the complete ophthalmoplegia was observed during late follow-up. In retrospect, patients diagnosed with often misunderstood CRAO and ischemic optic neuropathy with orbital signs after spinal surgery most likely had orbital compartment syndrome. The inclusion of orbital signs in the clinical picture of ischemic optic neuropathy and CRAO is not only incorrect but also gives the impression of therapeutic futility, thereby preventing successful orbital decompression in a timely fashion.",

To date there is no consensus or national guidelines on how this disorder should be managed. As academic neurologists and ophthalmologists treat CRAO frequently, we set out to understand how these clinicians approach patients with CRAO with a national survey. We identified university-associated teaching hospitals offering vascular neurology, neuro-ophthalmology and/or retina fellowships in the US and asked the directors of the programs to respond to questions in an open response format to profile the acute management of CRAO at their institution. We found remarkable heterogeneity in the approach to acute treatment of patients with CRAO among the 45 institutions that responded to the survey. Only 20% had a formal policy, guideline or white paper to standardize the approach to treatment. The primary treating physician was an ophthalmologist, neurologist, or neuro-ophthalmologist 44, 27, and 4% of the time, respectively; 24% were co-managed acutely by neurology and ophthalmology. Intravenous fibrinolysis was offered to selected patients in 53% of institutions, and was the preferred initial treatment in 36%. When the acute treatment team involved a vascular neurologist, fibrinolysis was more likely to be considered a first-line treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Anterior chamber paracentesis, ocular massage and hyperbaric oxygen therapy were offered 42, 66 and 7% of the time, respectively, while 9% of institutions offered no treatment. Anterior chamber paracentesis was more likely to be offered at programs where neurologists were not involved in treating CRAOs (p &lt; 0.001). At 35% of institutions, patients with acute CRAO were not routinely referred to a general emergency room for initial evaluation and treatment. Carotid imaging was routinely obtained by 89% of programs, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain by 69%, echocardiogram by 62%, laboratory screening for an inflammatory state by 27% and retinal angiography by 30%. The thoroughness of vascular risk factors' screening was greater in programs that routinely referred acute CRAO cases to the emergency department. This survey shows that there is significant variability in treatment practices for acute CRAO in the US. Because of the high cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk reported in this population of patients, it is notable that the approach to risk factor screening is also highly variable and many programs do not routinely refer patients to an emergency department for urgent evaluation. Finally, there appears to be equipoise among treatment teams regarding the efficacy of systemic fibrinolysis, as 53% of programs report a willingness to treat at least some patients with this modality.",

Vision loss following prone surgery is most commonly attributed to direct pressure on the eye but can also be caused by central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) in the absence of pressure on the eye. Central retinal artery occlusion has not been previously described following prone transcranial surgery for craniosynostosis. We present two cases of monocular CRAO following prone calvarial expansion. A multidisciplinary root cause analysis suggested that raised intracranial pressure and intraoperative tranexamic acid may have been risk factors for the development of CRAO in these cases as no conventional risk factors for CRAO following prone surgery were present. Because of this, we retrospectively reviewed all prone transcranial procedures performed at the Oxford Craniofacial Unit for the presence of raised intracranial pressure and intraoperative tranexamic acid use. A total of 662 prone procedures have been performed between 1994 and March, 2019. Tranexamic acid has been used routinely in all transcranial procedures since 2012 and in the last 311 consecutive prone cases. Fifty-one (7.7%) prone procedures were performed for raised intracranial pressure, and tranexamic acid was used in the 33 most recent of these. Since the implementation of standard intraoperative administration of tranexamic acid there have been 2 cases of CRAO following prone surgery. The overall incidence of CRAO was 0.3% but was 6% in the context of raised intracranial pressure and tranexamic acid use. Prone positioning raised intracranial pressure and tranexamic acid use together may represent a potent combination of risk factors for CRAO.",

An ophthalmologic assessment revealed a left afferent pupillary defect, minimal visual acuity, macular edema with a cherry red spot, and multiple emboli in the inferotemporal arcade of the left eye. A neurologic examination was otherwise nonfocal; neuroimaging was normal. Acute CRAO was diagnosed, and rt-PA was administered intravenously 185 minutes after symptom onset. A repeat examination 4.5 hours after treatment found improved vision, reduced macular edema, and no emboli. An ophthalmologic evaluation 10 days later found a visual acuity of 20/200 in the left eye and bilateral arterial sclerosis without evidence of retinal emboli or macular edema. This case illustrates that intravenous rt-PA may be an effective therapeutic option for CRAO in select patients. Given the current literature and the recommended established safety window for thrombolytics in acute ischemic cerebral stroke, it is reasonable to administer intravenous treatment for CRAO within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.

In addition, measurements were made in six patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and three patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) for comparison. The average aqueous \u03b2(2)M was increased in eyes with uveitic cataracts (678 \u03bcg/1) and RRD (533 \u03bcg/1), when compared to eyes with senile cataracts (265 \u03bcg/1), atopic cataracts (309 \u03bcg/1) and CRAO (122 \u03bcg/1). However, comparison of \u03b2(2)M to albumin aqueous-to-serum ratios (protein coefficient analysis) revealed that the aqueous \u03b2(2)M elevation was specific in only uveitic cataracts, with the elevation in RRD being most likely due to breakdown of the bloodocular barrier.

Crucial information required in the management of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is the length of time the retina can survive following that. An experimental study shows that CRAO for 97min produces no detectable permanent retinal damage but there is a progressive ischemic damage thereafter, and by 4h the retina has suffered irreversible damage. In the clinical section, I discuss at length various controversies on acute retinal arterial ischemic disorders. Classification of acute retinal arterial ischemic disorders: These are of 4 types: CRAO, branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), cotton wool spots and amaurosis fugax. Both CRAO and BRAO further comprise multiple clinical entities. Contrary to the universal belief, pathogenetically, clinically and for management, CRAO is not one clinical entity but 4 distinct clinical entities - non-arteritic CRAO, non-arteritic CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing, arteritic CRAO associated with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and transient non-arteritic CRAO. Similarly, BRAO comprises permanent BRAO, transient BRAO and cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO), and the latter further consists of 3 distinct clinical entities - non-arteritic CLRAO alone, non-arteritic CLRAO associated with central retinal vein occlusion and arteritic CLRAO associated with GCA. Understanding these classifications is essential to comprehend fully various aspects of these disorders. Central retinal artery occlusion: The pathogeneses, clinical features and management of the various types of CRAO are discussed in detail. Contrary to the prevalent belief, spontaneous improvement in both visual acuity and visual fields does occur, mainly during the first 7 days. The incidence of spontaneous visual acuity improvement during the first 7 days differs significantly (p&lt;0.001) among the 4 types of CRAO; among them, in eyes with initial visual acuity of counting finger or worse, visual acuity improved, remained stable or deteriorated in non-arteritic CRAO in 22%, 66% and 12% respectively; in non-arteritic CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing in 67%, 33% and none respectively; and in transient non-arteritic CRAO in 82%, 18% and none respectively. Arteritic CRAO shows no change. Recent studies have shown that administration of local intra-arterial thrombolytic agent not only has no beneficial effect but also can be harmful. Prevalent multiple misconceptions on CRAO are discussed. Branch retinal artery occlusion: Pathogeneses, clinical features and management of various types of BRAO are discussed at length.

It results in profound, usually monocular vision loss, and is associated with significant functional morbidity. The risk factors for CRAO are the same atherosclerotic risk factors as for stroke and heart disease. As such, individuals with CRAO may be at risk of ischemic end organ damage such as a cerebral stroke. Therefore, the management of CRAO is not only to restore vision, but at the same time to manage risk factors that may lead to other vascular conditions. There are a number of therapies that has been used in the treatment of CRAO in the past. These include carbogen inhalation, acetazolamide infusion, ocular massage and paracentesis, as well as various vasodilators such as intravenous glyceryl trinitrate. None of these \"standard agents\" have been shown to alter the natural history of disease definitively. There has been recent interest shown in the use of thrombolytic therapy, delivered either intravenously or intra-arterially by direct catheterisation of the ophthalmic artery. Whilst a number of observational series have shown that the recovery of vision can be quite dramatic, two recent randomised controlled trials have not demonstrated efficacy. On the contrary, intra-arterial delivery of thrombolytic may result in an increased risk of intracranial and systemic haemorrhage, while the intravenous use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was not shown to be efficacious within 24 h of symptom onset. Nevertheless, both of these studies have shown one thing in common, and that is for treatment to be effective in CRAO, it must be deployed within a short time window, probably within 6 h of symptom onset. Therefore, while CRAO is a disease that does not have a treatment, nevertheless it needs to follow the same principles of treatment as any other vascular end organ ischaemic disease. That is, to attempt to reperfuse ischemic tissue as quickly as possible and to institute secondary prevention early.",

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a rare complication of ICAD, secondary either to haemodynamic compromise, with ocular hypoperfusion and reverse flow within the ophthalmic artery, or to thromboembolic events, in rarer cases.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23045923": "Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an uncommon eye disorder, but one that typically produces severe and irreversible vision loss in the affected eye. The retina has a dual blood supply, with the retinal circulation supplying the inner layers and the choroidal circulation supplying the outer layers. In CRAO, vision loss results from cell death in the inner retinal layers despite relative sparing of the outer layers. If supplemental oxygen is provided, however, oxygen from the choroidal circulation may diffuse in adequate quantity to the inner layers of the retina to maintain retinal function and restore vision. In some patients this can be achieved with normobaric hyperoxia; in others, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) may be required. The challenge is to provide the supplemental oxygen early enough after the onset of vision loss to prevent irreversible damage to the retina. In experimental models of complete CRAO, the ischemic time window before permanent retinal damage occurs is just over 90 minutes; in the clinical setting where occlusion may be incomplete, return of vision may be achieved even after delays of eight to 24 hours. In patients with a clinical picture of CRAO who present within 24 hours of vision loss, supplemental oxygen should be started immediately at the highest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). If vision is not quickly restored, emergent HBO2 should be undertaken if feasible. If the patient responds to HBO2, follow-up treatment with supplemental oxygen should be customized to maintain retinal viability until the obstructed retinal artery recanalizes, which typically occurs within the first 72 hours. This paper reviews the pertinent literature on CRAO and HBO2 and provides a treatment algorithm.",

For gene activation, the chromatin structure is altered to an open configuration. The mechanism for this process has been extensively analyzed. However, the mechanism by which repressive chromatin is reconstituted to terminate transcription has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which chromatin is reconstituted in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i><i>fbp1</i> gene, which is robustly induced upon glucose starvation but tightly repressed under glucose-rich conditions. We found that the chromatin structure in the region upstream from <i>fbp1</i> is closed by a two-step process. When cells are returned to glucose-rich medium following glucose starvation, changes in the nucleosome pattern alter the chromatin configuration at the transcription factor binding site to an inaccessible state, after which the nucleosome density upstream from <i>fbp1</i> gradually increases via histone loading. Interestingly, this histone loading was observed in the absence of the Tup family corepressors Tup11 and Tup12. Analysis of strains carrying either gene disruptions or mutations affecting nine fission yeast histone chaperone genes demonstrated that the histone chaperone Asf1 induces nucleosome loading during glucose repression. These data establish a previously unappreciated chromatin reconstitution mechanism in <i>fbp1</i> repression.",

To identify transcriptional regulators acting downstream from or in parallel to PKA, we screened an adh-driven cDNA plasmid library for genes that increase fbp1 transcription in a strain with elevated PKA activity. Two such clones express amino-terminally truncated forms of the S. pombe tup12 protein that resembles the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tup1p global corepressor. These clones appear to act as dominant negative alleles. Deletion of both tup12 and the closely related tup11 gene causes a 100-fold increase in fbp1-lacZ expression, indicating that tup11 and tup12 are redundant negative regulators of fbp1 transcription. In strains lacking tup11 and tup12, the atf1-pcr1 transcriptional activator continues to play a central role in fbp1-lacZ expression; however, spc1 MAPK phosphorylation of atf1 is no longer essential for its activation. We discuss possible models for the role of tup11- and tup12-mediated repression with respect to signaling from the MAPK and PKA pathways. A third clone identified in our screen expresses the php5 protein subunit of the CCAAT-binding factor (CBF). Deletion of php5 reduces fbp1 expression under both repressed and derepressed conditions. The CBF appears to act in parallel to atf1-pcr1, although it is unclear whether or not CBF activity is regulated by PKA.",

Antisense transcripts from the fission yeast fbp1 locus (fbp1-as) are expressed in glucose-rich conditions and anticorrelated with transcription of metabolic stress-induced lncRNA (mlonRNA) and mRNA on the sense strand during glucose starvation. Here, we investigate the localization and decay of antisense RNAs at fbp1 and other loci, and propose a model to explain the rapid switch between antisense and sense mlonRNA/mRNA transcription triggered by glucose starvation. We show that fbp1-as shares many features with mRNAs, such as a 5'-cap and poly(A)-tail, and that its decay partially depends upon Rrp6, a cofactor of the nuclear exosome complex involved in 3'-5' degradation of RNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and polysome fractionation show that the majority of remaining fbp1-as localizes to the cytoplasm and binds to polyribosomes in glucose-rich conditions. Furthermore, fbp1-as and antisense RNA at other stress-responsive loci are promptly degraded via the cotranslational nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. These results suggest NMD may potentiate the swift disappearance of antisense RNAs in response to cellular stress.",

In fission yeast, glucose starvation triggers lncRNA transcription across promoter regions of stress-responsive genes including fbp1 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase1). At the fbp1 promoter, this transcription promotes chromatin remodeling and fbp1 mRNA expression. Here, we demonstrate that such upstream noncoding transcription facilitates promoter association of the stress-responsive transcriptional activator Atf1 at the sites of transcription, leading to activation of the downstream stress genes. Genome-wide analyses revealed that \u223c50 Atf1-binding sites show marked decrease in Atf1 occupancy when cells are treated with a transcription inhibitor. Most of these transcription-enhanced Atf1-binding sites are associated with stress-dependent induction of the adjacent mRNAs or lncRNAs, as observed in fbp1 These Atf1-binding sites exhibit low Atf1 occupancy and high histone density in glucose-rich conditions, and undergo dramatic changes in chromatin status after glucose depletion: enhanced Atf1 binding, histone eviction, and histone H3 acetylation. We also found that upstream transcripts bind to the Groucho-Tup1 type transcriptional corepressors Tup11 and Tup12, and locally antagonize their repressive functions on Atf1 binding. These results reveal a new mechanism in which upstream noncoding transcription locally magnifies the specific activation of stress-inducible genes via counteraction of corepressors.",

These regulate transcription by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. We herein show that the chromatin configuration is altered into an accessible state within 290 bp downstream from the initiation site of metabolic-stress-induced lncRNAs (mlonRNAs) in the promoter of the fission yeast fbp1 gene, whose transcription is massively induced upon glucose starvation. Chromatin upstream from fbp1 is progressively altered into an open configuration, as a cascade of transcription of three overlapping mlonRNA species (-a, -b and -c in order) occurs with transcriptional initiation sites progressing 5' to 3' upstream of the fbp1 promoter. Initiation of the shortest mlonRNA (mlonRNA-c) induces chromatin remodeling around a transcription factor-binding site and subsequent massive induction of fbp1. We identify the cis-element required for mlonRNA-c initiation, and by changing the distance between mlonRNA-initiation site and the transcription factor-binding site, we show that mlonRNA-initiation effectively induces chromatin remodeling in a limited distance within 290 bp. These results indicate that mlonRNAs are transcribed across the fbp1 promoter as a short-range inducer for local chromatin alterations, and suggest that strict chromatin modulation is archived via stepwise mlonRNA-initiations.",

To study the mechanisms that result in selective gene responses, we examined the role of the fission yeast Tup1 family repressors in chromatin regulation. We found that chromatin structure around a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-like sequence in ade6-M26 that is bound by Atf1.Pcr1 transcriptional activation was altered in response to osmotic stress but not to heat and oxidative stresses. Such chromatin structure alteration occurred later than the Atf1 phosphorylation but correlated well with stress-induced transcriptional activation at ade6-M26. This chromatin structure alteration required components for the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascade and both subunits of the M26-binding CREB/ATF-type protein Atf1.Pcr1. Cation stress and glucose starvation selectively caused chromatin structure alteration around CRE-like sequences in cta3(+) and fbp1(+) promoters, respectively, in correlation with transcriptional activation. However, the tup11Delta tup12Delta double deletion mutants lost the selectivity of stress responses of chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation of cta3(+) and fbp1(+). These data indicate that the Tup1-like repressors regulate the chromatin structure to ensure the specificity of gene activation in response to particular stresses.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23398982": " Glucose is a signaling molecule which regulates multiple events in eukaryotic organisms and the most preferred carbon source in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The ability of this yeast to grow in the absence of glucose becomes strongly limited due to lack of enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle that support diauxic growth. The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway and its effectors, Sty1 MAPK and transcription factor Atf1, play a critical role in the adaptation of fission yeast to grow on alternative non-fermentable carbon sources by inducing the expression of fbp1+ gene, coding for the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The cell integrity Pmk1 pathway is another MAPK cascade that regulates various processes in fission yeast, including cell wall construction, cytokinesis, and ionic homeostasis. Pmk1 pathway also becomes strongly activated in response to glucose deprivation but its role during glucose exhaustion and ensuing adaptation to respiratory metabolism is currently unknown. We found that Pmk1 activation in the absence of glucose takes place only after complete depletion of this carbon source and that such activation is not related to an endogenous oxidative stress. Notably, Pmk1 MAPK activation relies on de novo protein synthesis, is independent on known upstream activators of the pathway like Rho2 GTPase, and involves PKC ortholog Pck2. Also, the Glucose/cAMP pathway is required operative for full activation of the Pmk1 signaling cascade. Mutants lacking Pmk1 displayed a partial growth defect in respiratory media which was not observed in the presence of glucose. This phenotype was accompanied by a decreased and delayed expression of transcription factor Atf1 and target genes fbp1+ and pyp2+. Intriguingly, the kinetics of Sty1 activation in Pmk1-less cells was clearly altered during growth adaptation to non-fermentable carbon sources. Unknown upstream elements mediate Pck2-dependent signal transduction of glucose withdrawal to the cell integrity MAPK pathway. This signaling cascade reinforces the adaptive response of fission yeast to such nutritional stress by enhancing the activity of the SAPK pathway.",

ADAS11 increased more in participants whose NPI-Total increased. In participants with mild to moderate AD, high dose semagacestat treatment was associated with greater severity and faster worsening of NPS in a pattern resembling an agitated depression.

Recently disclosed Phase III findings on semagacestat indicated that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on this drug showed significantly worsened cognitive function compared to those treated with placebo. Since previous studies have shown that drugs impairing cognitive function (including scopolamine, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonists, and nociceptin receptor agonists) disrupt or decrease power of elicited theta oscillation in the hippocampus, we tested the effects of acute and sub-chronic administration of semagacestat in this assay. Field potentials were recorded across the hippocampal formation with NeuroNexus multi-site silicon probes in urethane anesthetized male C57BL/6 mice; hippocampal CA1 theta oscillation was elicited by electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis. Sub-chronic administration of semagacestat twice daily over 12 days at a dose known to reduce beta-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) level [100 mg/kg, p.o.

We propose that the disruptive effect of semagacestat on hippocampal function could be one of the contributing mechanisms to its worsening of cognition in patients with AD. As it has been expected, both acute and sub-chronic administrations of semagacestat significantly decreased A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels but the current findings do not reveal the mode of action of semagacestat in disrupting hippocampal oscillation.",

Thus, drugs that regulate the brain A\u03b2 levels could provide effective disease-modifying therapy for AD. A\u03b2 is generated from amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases. Several \u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been developed as AD therapeutics. However, simple inhibition of \u03b3-secretase would have adverse consequences, as \u03b3-secretase is involved in several signaling pathways including Notch signaling. In 2010, the development of semagacestat, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, was halted. Preliminary results from Phase III studies showed that semagacestat failed to slow disease progression, and it was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Furthermore, semagacestat treatment was associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Thus, alternative compounds that indirectly modulate \u03b3-secretase activity without affecting Notch are attracting attention. However, molecular mechanism of these compounds still remains unclear. To develop therapeutics with superior specificity and high potency for AD, we have been analyzing the mode of actions of known compounds, structure-and-function relationship of the \u03b3-secretase complex and possible rational design of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators using chemical biology.",

Compounds that inhibit or modulate \u03b3-secretase, the pivotal enzyme that generates \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), are potential therapeutics for AD. This article briefly reviews the profile of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators that have reached the clinic. Studies in both transgenic and non-transgenic animal models of AD have indicated that \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, administered by the oral route, are able to lower brain A\u03b2 concentrations. However, scanty data are available on the effects of these compounds on brain A\u03b2 deposition after prolonged administration. \u03b3-Secretase inhibitors may cause abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract, thymus, spleen, skin, and decrease in lymphocytes and alterations in hair color in experimental animals and in man, effects believed to be associated with the inhibition of the cleavage of Notch, a transmembrane receptor involved in regulating cell-fate decisions. Unfortunately, two large Phase III clinical trials of semagacestat in mild-to-moderate AD patients were prematurely interrupted because of the observation of a detrimental cognitive and functional effect of the drug. These detrimental effects were mainly ascribed to the inhibition of the processing of an unknown substrate of \u03b3-secretase. It has been also hypothesized that the detrimental cognitive effects observed after semagacestat administration are due to the accumulation of the neurotoxic precursor of A\u03b2 (the carboxy-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein, APP, or CTF\u03b2) resulting from the block of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage activity on APP. Some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other small organic molecules have been found to modulate \u03b3-secretase shifting its cleavage activity from longer to shorter A\u03b2 species without affecting Notch cleavage. However, two large Phase III studies in mild AD patients with tarenflurbil, a putative \u03b3-secretase modulator, were also completely negative. The failure of tarenflurbil was ascribed to low potency and brain penetration. New more selective \u03b3-secretase inhibitors and more potent, more brain penetrant \u03b3-secretase modulators are being developed with the hope of overcoming the previous setbacks. Further understanding of the reasons of the failures of these \u03b3-secretase-based drugs in AD may be important for the future research on effective treatments for this devastating disease.",

However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E \u03f54 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug. Solanezumab, another humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, was shown to neutralize soluble A\u03b2 oligomers, which is believed to be the more neurotoxic A\u03b2 species. Phase II studies showed a good safety profile of solanezumab while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting A\u03b2 may not be clinically efficacious in AD. The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab and two Phase III trials on solanezumab will tell us if passive anti-A\u03b2 immunization is able to alter the course of this devastating disease, and if A\u03b2 is still a viable target for anti-AD drugs.",

We have recently described an oligonucleotide microarray (MitoChip) for rapid and accurate sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome (Zhou et al., J Mol Diagnostics, 8: 9_14, 2006), greatly facilitating the analysis of mtDNA mutations in cancer. In this report, we perform a comprehensive cataloging of somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome of human pancreatic cancers using our novel array-based approach. MitoChip analysis was performed on DNA isolated from 15 histologically confirmed resection specimens of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. In all cases, matched nonneoplastic pancreatic tissue was obtained as germline control for mtDNA sequence. DNA was extracted from snap-frozen cryostat-embedded specimens and hybridized to the sequencing microarray after appropriate polymerase chain reaction amplification and labeling steps. The vast majority of somatic mutational analyses of mtDNA in human cancers utilize lymphocyte DNA as germline control, without excluding the potential for organ-specific polymorphisms. Therefore, we also examined a series of 15 paired samples of DNA obtained from nonneoplastic pancreata and corresponding EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines to determine whether lymphocyte DNA provides an accurate surrogate for the mtDNA sequence of pancreatic tissue. We sequenced 497,070 base pairs of mtDNA in the 15 matched samples of pancreatic cancer and nonneoplastic pancreatic tissue, and 467,269 base pairs (94.0%) were assigned by the automated genotyping software. All 15 pancreatic cancers demonstrated at least one somatic mtDNA mutation compared to the control germline DNA with a range of 1-14 alterations. Of the 71 somatic mutations observed in our series, 18 were nonsynonymous coding region alterations (i.e., resulting in an amino acid change), 22 were synonymous coding region alterations, and 31 involved noncoding mtDNA segments (including ribosomal and transfer RNAs). Overall, somatic mutations in the coding region most commonly involved the ND4, COI, and CYTB genes; of note, an A-G transition at nucleotide position 841 in the 12sRNA was observed in three independent samples. In the paired analysis of nonneoplastic pancreata and lymphoblastoid cell line DNA, 14 nucleotide discrepancies were observed out of 226,876 nucleotide sequences (a concordance rate of 99.99%), with 9 samples demonstrating a perfect match across all bases assigned. Our findings confirm that somatic mtDNA mutations are common in pancreatic cancers, and therefore, have the potential to be a clinically useful biomarker for early detection. Further, our studies confirm that lymphocyte DNA is an excellent, albeit not perfect, surrogate for nonneoplastic pancreatic tissues in terms of being utilized as a germline control.

The good performance was achieved by using in-house software for the automated analysis of additional probes on the array that cover the most common haplotypes in the hypervariable regions (HVR). Failure to call a base was associated mostly with the presence of either a run of &gt; or =4 C bases or a sequence variant within 12 bases up- or downstream of that base. A major drawback of the MitoChip is its inability to detect insertions/deletions and its low sensitivity and specificity in the detection of heteroplasmy.

As such, mtDNA is directly integrated into mitochondrial biogenesis and signaling and regulates mitochondrial metabolism in concert with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial factors. Mitochondria are a highly dynamic, pleiomorphic network that undergoes fission and fusion events. Within this network, mtDNAs are packaged into structures called nucleoids which are actively distributed in discrete foci within the network. This sensitive organelle is frequently disrupted by insults such as oxidants and inflammatory cytokines, and undergoes genomic damage with double- and single-strand breaks that impair its function.

The mtDNA is more vulnerable to oxidative modifications compared to nuclear DNA because of its proximity to ROS-producing sites, limited presence of DNA damage repair systems, and continuous replication in the cell. mtDNA mutations can be inherited or sporadic. Simple mtDNA mutations are point mutations, which are frequently found in mitochondrial tRNA loci, causing mischarging of mitochondrial tRNAs or deletion, duplication, or reduction in mtDNA content. Because mtDNA has multiple copies and a specific replication mechanism in cells or tissues, it can be heterogenous, resulting in characteristic phenotypic presentations such as heteroplasmy, genetic drift, and threshold effects. Recent studies have increased the understanding of basic mitochondrial genetics, providing an insight into the correlations between mitochondrial mutations and cardiac manifestations including hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death with a syndromic or non-syndromic phenotype. Clinical manifestations of mitochondrial mutations, which result from structural defects, functional impairment, or both, are increasingly detected but are not clear because of the complex interplay between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, even in homoplasmic mitochondrial populations. Additionally, various factors such as individual susceptibility, nutritional state, and exposure to chemicals can influence phenotypic presentation, even for the same mtDNA mutation.In this chapter, we summarize our current understanding of mtDNA mutations and their role in cardiac involvement.

Here, we confirm this hypothesis with the identification of de novo mutations in LMNB1 in seven individuals with pronounced primary microcephaly (ranging from -3.6 to -12 SD) associated with relative short stature and variable degree of intellectual disability and neurological features as the core symptoms. Simplified gyral pattern of the cortex and abnormal corpus callosum were noted on MRI of three individuals, and these individuals also presented with a more severe phenotype.

The means \u00b1 standard deviations of the cumulative LAR difference between PBT and IMXT for the four categories were (i) 1.02 \u00b1 0.52% (n = 7, P = 0.0021), (ii) 23.3 \u00b1 17.2% (n = 8, P = 0.0065), (iii) 16.6 \u00b1 19.9% (n = 8, P = 0.0497) and (iv) 50.0 \u00b1 21.1% (n = 3, P = 0.0274), respectively (one tailed t-test). The numbers needed to treat (NNT) were (i) 98.0, (ii) 4.3, (iii) 6.0 and (iv) 2.0 for WCNS, respectively. In pediatric patients who had undergone PBT, the LAR of PBT was significantly lower than the LAR of IMXT estimated by in silico modeling. Although a validation study is required, it is suggested that the LAR would be useful as an in silico surrogate marker of secondary cancer induced by different radiotherapy techniques.",

These patients included 40 males and 22 females, and had a median age of 10 years (range: 0-19 years) at the time of treatment. The irradiation dose ranged from 10.8 to 81.2 GyE (median: 50.4 GyE). The median follow-up period was 8.1 years (5.0-31.2 years). The 5-, 10- and 20-year rates for grade 2 or higher late toxicities were 18%, 35% and 45%, respectively, and those for grade 3 or higher late toxicities were 6%, 17% and 17% respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the irradiated site (head and neck, brain) was significantly associated with late toxicities. No malignant secondary tumors occurred within the irradiated field. The 10- and 20-year cumulative rates for all secondary tumors, malignant secondary tumors, and malignant nonhematologic secondary tumors were 8% and 16%, 5% and 13%, and 3% and 11%, respectively. Our data indicate that PBT has the potential to reduce the risk of late mortality and secondary malignancy. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm the benefits of PBT for pediatric tumors.",

Treatment of pediatric CNS malignancies requires multimodal treatment using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and advances in these treatments have given favorable results and longer survival. However, treatment-related toxicities have also occurred, particularly for radiotherapy, after which secondary cancer, reduced function of irradiated organs, and retarded growth are significant problems. Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a particle radiotherapy with excellent dose localization that permits treatment of liver and lung cancer by administration of a high dose to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues.

Notably, proton beam therapy is very useful for pediatric cancer; since the pediatric radiation dose to normal tissues should be reduced as much as possible because of the effect of radiation on growth, intellectual development, endocrine organ function and secondary cancer development. Hepatocellular carcinoma is common in Asia, and most of the studies of proton beam therapy for liver cancer have been reported by Japanese investigators. Proton beam therapy is also a standard treatment for nasal and paranasal lesions and lesions at the base of the skull, because the radiation dose to critical organs such as the eyes, optic nerves and central nervous system can be reduced with proton beam therapy. For prostate cancer, comparative studies that address adverse effects, safety, patient quality of life and socioeconomic issues should be performed to determine the appropriate use of proton beam therapy for prostate cancer. Regarding new proton beam therapy applications, experience with proton beam therapy combined with chemotherapy is limited, although favorable outcomes have been recently reported for locally advanced lung cancer, esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer. Therefore, 'chemoproton' therapy appears to be a very attractive field for further clinical investigations. In conclusion, there are cost issues and considerations regarding national insurance for the use of proton beam therapy in Japan. Further studies and discussions are needed to address the use of proton beam therapy for several types of cancers, and for maintaining the quality of life of patients while retaining a high cure rate.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10394397": "The risk of induction of a second primary cancer after a therapeutic irradiation with conventional photon beams is well recognized and documented. However, in general, it is totally overwhelmed by the benefit of the treatment. The same is true to a large extent for the combinations of radiation and drug therapy. After fast neutron therapy, the risk of induction of a second cancer is greater than after photon therapy. Neutron RBE increases with decreasing dose and there is a wide evidence that neutron RBE is greater for cancer induction (and for other late effects relevant in radiation protection) than for cell killing. Animal data on RBE for tumor induction are reviewed, as well as other biological effects such as life shortening, malignant cell transformation in vitro, chromosome aberrations, genetic effects. These effects can be related, directly or indirectly, to cancer induction to the extent that they express a \"genomic\" lesion. Almost no reliable human epidemiological data are available so far. For fission neutrons a RBE for cancer induction of about 20 relative to photons seems to be a reasonable assumption. For fast neutrons, due to the difference in energy spectrum, a RBE of 10 can be assumed. After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average). The RBE of heavy-ions for cancer induction can be assumed to be similar to fission neutrons, i.e. about 20 relative to photons. However, after heavy-ion beam therapy, the risk should be divided by 3, as after proton therapy due to the excellent physical selectivity of the irradiation. Therefore a risk 5 to 10 times higher than photons could be assumed. This range is probably a pessimistic estimate for carbon ions since most of the normal tissues, at the level of the initial plateau, are irradiated with low-LET radiation.",

However, proton RT is likely to be less robust to anatomical changes occurring during therapy. In this study we present a recent clinical case to illustrate this issue. A five-year-old boy with a highly proliferating malignant intracranial nerve sheath tumour underwent a partial resection prior to RT and developed a post-surgery oedema close to the surgical cavity. RT was delivered with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to a total tumour dose of 61.2 Gy. The most critical organs at risk (ORs) were the right optical nerve, brainstem and chiasm. Proton plans were constructed for the purpose of this study. In order to simulate a worst-case scenario, the extent of the oedema observed in the last part of the treatment was used to modify the oedema on the planning computed tomography (CT). Both the photon and proton plans were then re-calculated, as follows: Scenario A: Treatment planning based on the planning CT with oedema and dose calculated as if it was delivered without oedema. Scenario B: Treatment planning on the modified planning CT without oedema, but re-calculated with oedema. These two scenarios were compared to the situation where the oedema was present at treatment planning and unchanged during RT. Total dose to critical ORs remained unchanged for the photon plans, with changes within 0.3 Gy for the normal tissues and nearly identical target coverage. For protons, scenario A led to increased maximal doses in all critical ORs, 5.1 Gy in the brainstem, 6.1 Gy in the chiasm and 6.4 Gy in the right optical nerve. For scenario B the proton plans resulted in a loss in target coverage. This case study shows that RT with protons were far less robust to anatomical changes than when treated with photons, emphasising the increased need for adaptive approaches in RT with protons.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149823": " Particle beam therapy is associated with significant startup and operational cost. Multileaf collimator (MLC) provides an attractive option to improve the efficiency and reduce the treatment cost. A direct transfer of the MLC technology from external beam radiation therapy is intuitively straightforward to proton therapy. However, activation, neutron production, and the associated secondary cancer risk in proton beam should be an important consideration which is evaluated. Monte Carlo simulation with FLUKA particle transport code was applied in this study for a number of treatment models. The authors have performed a detailed study of the neutron generation, ambient dose equivalent [H\u2217(10)], and activation of a typical tungsten MLC and compared with those obtained from a brass aperture used in a typical proton therapy system. Brass aperture and tungsten MLC were modeled by absorber blocks in this study, representing worst-case scenario of a fully closed collimator. With a tungsten MLC, the secondary neutron dose to the patient is at least 1.5 times higher than that from a brass aperture. The H\u2217(10) from a tungsten MLC at 10 cm downstream is about 22.3 mSv/Gy delivered to water phantom by noncollimated 200 MeV beam of 20 cm diameter compared to 14 mSv/Gy for the brass aperture. For a 30-fraction treatment course, the activity per unit volume in brass aperture reaches 5.3 \u00d7 10\u2074 Bq cm(-3) at the end of the last treatment. The activity in brass decreases by a factor of 380 after 24 h, additional 6.2 times after 40 days of cooling, and is reduced to background level after 1 yr. Initial activity in tungsten after 30 days of treating 30 patients per day is about 3.4 times higher than in brass that decreases only by a factor of 2 after 40 days and accumulates to 1.2 \u00d7 10\u2076 Bq cm(-3) after a full year of operation. The daily utilization of the MLC leads to buildup of activity with time. The overall activity continues to increase due to (179)Ta with a half-life of 1.82 yr and thus require prolonged storage for activity cooling. The H\u2217(10) near the patient side of the tungsten block is about 100 \u03bcSv/h and is 27 times higher at the upstream side of the block. This would lead to an accumulated dose for therapists in a year that may exceed occupational maximum permissible dose (50 mSv/yr). The value of H\u2217(10) at the upstream surface of the tungsten block is about 220 times higher than that of the brass. MLC is an efficient way for beam shaping and overall cost reduction device in proton therapy. However, based on this study, tungsten seems to be not an optimal material for MLC in proton beam therapy. Usage of tungsten MLC in clinic may create unnecessary risks associated with the secondary neutrons and induced radioactivity for patients and staff depending on the patient load. A careful selection of material for manufacturing of an optimal MLC for proton therapy is thus desired.",

Five patients (median age, 4 years; range, 2-11 years) who underwent PBT for retroperitoneal neuroblastoma were selected for treatment planning simulation. Four patients had stage 4 tumors and one had stage 2A tumor, according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System. Two patients received 36 Gy, two received 21.6 Gy, and one received 41.4 Gy of radiation. The volume structures of these patients were used for simulations of CRT and IMRT treatment. Dose-volume analyses of liver, stomach, colon, small intestine, pancreas, and bone were performed for the simulations. Secondary cancer risks in these organs were calculated using the organ equivalent dose (OED) model, which took into account the rates of cell killing, repopulation, and the neutron dose from the treatment machine. In all evaluated organs, the mean dose in PBT was 20-80% of that in CRT. IMRT also showed lower mean doses than CRT for two organs (20% and 65%), but higher mean doses for the other four organs (110-120%). The risk of secondary cancer in PBT was 24-83% of that in CRT for five organs, but 121% of that in CRT for pancreas. The risk of secondary cancer in IMRT was equal to or higher than CRT for four organs (range 100-124%). Low radiation doses in normal organs are more frequently observed in PBT than in IMRT. Assessments of secondary cancer risk showed that PBT reduces the risk of secondary cancer in most organs, whereas IMRT is associated with a higher risk than CRT.",

She had previously been successfully treated for a choroidal melanoma of the left eye with proton beam therapy (total dose: 60 cobalt gray equivalents) following local resection. MRI showed a lesion in the left cavernous sinus with extension into the orbit and a subsequent biopsy revealed a papillary meningioma. The cavernous tumor was treated with photon radiotherapy (total dose: 54Gy) which achieved an initial partial response. However, 8 months later the tumor extensively metastasized to the skull and the spine and the patient died 1 year after the treatment. The incidence of secondary malignancies after proton beam therapy is low but not negligible, therefore, it must be taken into account when planning a treatment as secondary tumors may present with a highly aggressive behaviour.",

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

Prospective trials confirming this are lacking due to the need for long-term follow-up and the ethical complexities of randomizing patients between modalities. The objective of the current study is to calculate the risk for secondary malignancies following PRT and photon-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Twenty-three patients (16 female and seven male), previously treated with active scanning PRT for malignant mediastinal lymphoma at Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center, were retrospectively re-planned using helical photon IMRT. The risk for radiation-induced secondary malignancies was estimated and evaluated using two distinct prediction models (1-4). <b>Results:</b> According to the Dasu model, the median absolute total risk for tumor induction following IMRT was 4.4% (range, 3.3-5.8%), 9.9% (range, 2.0-27.6%), and 1.0% (range, 0.5-1.5%) for lung, breast, and esophageal cancer, respectively. For PRT, it was significantly lower for the aforementioned organs at 1.6% (range, 0.7-2.1%), 4.5% (range, 0.0-15.5), and 0.8% (range, 0.0-1.6%), respectively (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.01). The mortality risk from secondary malignancies was also significantly reduced for PRT relative to IMRT at 1.1 vs. 3.1% (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.001), 0.9 vs. 1.9% (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.001), and 0.7 vs. 1.0% (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.001) for lung, breast, and esophageal tumors, respectively. Using the Schneider model, a significant risk reduction of 54.4% (range, 32.2-84.0%), 56.4% (range, 16.0-99.4%), and 24.4% (range, 0.0-99.0%) was seen for secondary lung, breast, and esophageal malignancies, favoring PRT vs. X-ray-based IMRT (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.01). <b>Conclusion:</b> Based on the two prediction models, PRT for malignant mediastinal lymphoma is expected to reduce the risk for radiation-induced secondary malignancies compared with the X-ray-based IMRT. The young age and the long natural history of patients diagnosed with mediastinal lymphoma predisposes them to a high risk of secondary malignancies following curative radiotherapy treatment and, as a consequence, potentially reducing this risk by utilizing advanced radiation therapy techniques such as PRT should be considered.",

Craniospinal irradiation of a male phantom was calculated for passively-scattered and scanned-beam proton treatment units. Organ doses were estimated from treatment plans; for the proton treatments, the amount of stray radiation was calculated separately using the Monte Carlo method. The organ doses were converted to risk of cancer incidence using a standard formalism developed for radiation protection purposes. The total lifetime risk of second cancer due exclusively to stray radiation was 1.5% for the passively scattered treatment versus 0.8% for the scanned proton beam treatment. Taking into account the therapeutic and stray radiation fields, the risk of second cancer from intensity-modulated radiation therapy and conventional radiotherapy photon treatments were 7 and 12 times higher than the risk associated with scanned-beam proton therapy, respectively, and 6 and 11 times higher than with passively scattered proton therapy, respectively.

Five proton therapy plans were created for each of three pediatric patients using PPT as well as PBS with two spot sizes (average sigma of ~17 mm and ~8 mm at isocenter) and choice of patient-specific apertures. The lifetime attributable second malignancy risks for both in-field and out-of-field tissues and organs were compared among five delivery techniques. The risk for in-field tissues was calculated using the organ equivalent dose, which is determined by the dose volume histogram. For out-of-field organs, the organ-specific dose equivalent from secondary neutrons was calculated using Monte Carlo and anthropomorphic pediatric phantoms. We find that either for small spot size PBS or for large spot size PBS, a patient-specific aperture reduces the in-field cancer risk to values lower than that for PPT. The reduction for large spot sizes (on average 43%) is larger than for small spot sizes (on average 21%). For out-of-field organs, the risk varies only marginally by employing a patient-specific aperture (on average from -2% to 16% with increasing distance from the tumor), but is still one to two orders of magnitude lower than that for PPT. In conclusion, when pencil beam spot sizes are large, the addition of apertures to sharpen the penumbra decreases the in-field radiation-induced secondary cancer risk. There is a slight increase in out-of-field cancer risk as a result of neutron scatter from the aperture, but this risk is by far outweighed by the in-field risk benefit from using an aperture with a large PBS spot size. In general, the risk for developing a second malignancy in out-of-field organs for PBS remains much lower compared to PPT even if apertures are being applied.",

Here we compare tangential 3D-CRT and VMAT to PBS proton therapy (PT) in terms of secondary cancer risk (SCR) for the lungs and for contralateral breast. Five BC patients including supraclavicular (SVC) nodes in the target (Group 1) and five including SVC plus internal-mammary-nodes (IMNs, Group 2) were considered. The Group 1 patients were planned by PT versus tangential 3D-CRT in free-breathing (FB). The Group 2 patients were planned by PT versus VMAT considering both FB and deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH) irradiation. The prescription dose to the target volume was 50 Gy (2 Gy/fraction). A constant RBE = 1.1 was assumed for PT. The SCR was evaluated with the excess absolute risk (EAR) formalism, considering also the age dependence. A cumulative EAR was finally computed. According to the linear, linear-exponential and linear-plateau dose response model, the cumulative EAR for Group 1 patients after PT was equal to 45 \u00b1 10, 17 \u00b1 3 and 15 \u00b1 3, respectively. The corresponding relative increase for tangential 3D-CRT was equal to a factor 2.1 \u00b1 0.5, 2.1 \u00b1 0.4 and 2.3 \u00b1 0.4. Group 2 patients showed a cumulative EAR after PT in FB equal to 65 \u00b1 3, 21 \u00b1 1 and 20 \u00b1 1, according to the different models; the relative risk obtained with VMAT increased by a factor 3.5 \u00b1 0.2, 5.2 \u00b1 0.3 and 5.1 \u00b1 0.3. Similar values emerge from DIBH plans. Contrary to photon radiotherapy, PT appears to be not sensitive to the age dependence due to the very low delivered dose. PBS PT is associated to significant SCR reduction in BC patients compared to photon radiotherapy. The benefits are maximized for young patients with both SVC and IMNs involvement. When combined with the improved sparing of the heart, this might contribute to the establishment of effective patient-selection criteria for proton BC treatments.",

Out-of-field absorbed and equivalent doses to organs in a whole-body phantom following a brain tumor treatment were subsequently simulated and used to estimate the risk of radiation-induced cancer. Additionally, the contribution of absorbed dose originating from radiation produced in the nozzle was calculated from simulations. Out-of-field absorbed doses to the TEPC ranged from 0.4 to 135 \u00b5Gy/Gy. The average deviation between simulations and measurements of the water phantom irradiations was about 17%. The absorbed dose contribution from radiation produced in the nozzle ranged between 0 and 70% of the total dose; the contribution was however small in absolute terms. The absorbed and equivalent doses to the organs ranged between 0.2 and 60 \u00b5Gy/Gy and 0.5-151 \u00b5Sv/Gy. The estimated lifetime risk of radiation-induced second cancer was approximately 0.01%.

Doses from the primary fields delivered to organs at risk of developing an SMN were determined from treatment plans. Secondary doses from the proton therapy and IMRT were determined from Monte Carlo simulations and available measured data, respectively. The risk of an SMN was estimated from primary and secondary doses on an organ-by-organ basis by use of risk models from the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. Proton therapy reduced the risk of an SMN by 26% to 39% compared with IMRT. The risk of an SMN for both modalities was greatest in the in-field organs. However, the risks from the in-field organs were considerably lower with the proton therapy plan than with the IMRT plan. This reduction was attributed to the substantial sparing of the rectum and bladder from exposure to the therapeutic beam by the proton therapy plan.

Ten patients, previously treated for liver metastases with photon-beam based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) were retrospectively planned for radiosurgery with IMPT.

Using the Schneider et al. model, lower risks for carcinoma-induction with IMPT were estimated for the skin, lungs, healthy part of the liver, esophagus and the remaining part of the body (p&lt;0.05). The risk of observing sarcomas in the bone was also reduced with IMPT (p&lt;0.05).

Multiple dosimetric studies in varying cancer subtypes have demonstrated that PRT enables the delivery of adequate target volume coverage with reduced integral dose delivered to surrounding tissues, and modeling studies taking into account dosimetry and radiation cell biology have estimated a significantly reduced risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancy with PRT. Clinical data are emerging supporting the lower incidence of secondary malignancies after PRT compared with historical photon data, though longer follow-up in proton treated cohorts is awaited. This article reviews the current dosimetric and clinical literature evaluating the incidence of and risk factors associated with radiation-induced secondary malignancy following PRT.",

The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate cancer incidence from dose distributions. For this purpose, target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity-modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. The cancer incidence has been derived from the mean doses for each organ. The results of this work are: (a) Intensity-modulated treatment of Hodgkin's disease using nine photon fields (15 MV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with two opposed photon fields (6 MV). (b) Intensity-modulated treatment using nine proton fields (maximum energy 177.25 MeV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with one proton field (160 MeV). (c) Irradiation with protons using the spot scanning technique decreases the avoidable cancer incidence compared to photon treatment by a factor of about two. This result is independent of the number of beams used. Our work suggests that there are radiotherapy indications in which intensity-modulated treatments will result in little or no reduction of cancer incidence compared to conventional treatments. However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment.",

In several pathological and physiological conditions increased BCAA plasma concentrations have been described. Elevated BCAA levels predict insulin resistance development. Moreover, BCAA levels higher than 2mmol/L are neurotoxic by inducing microglial activation in maple syrup urine disease. However, there are no studies about the direct effects of BCAA in circulating cells. We have explored whether BCAA could promote oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors. In cultured PBMCs, 10mmol/L BCAA increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via both NADPH oxidase and the mitochondria, and activated Akt-mTOR signalling. By using several inhibitors and activators of these molecular pathways we have described that mTOR activation by BCAA is linked to ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction. BCAA stimulated the activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which resulted in the release of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 or CD40L, and the migration of PBMCs. In conclusion, elevated BCAA blood levels can promote the activation of circulating PBMCs, by a mechanism that involving ROS production and NF-\u03baB pathway activation. These data suggest that high concentrations of BCAA could exert deleterious effects on circulating blood cells and therefore contribute to the pro-inflammatory and oxidative status observed in several pathophysiological conditions.",

Essential aminoacids methionine and lysine can be found in significantly lower amounts. On the contrary, the culinary and technologically non-processed plant food and whole-grain products contain essential nutrients in a highly condensed form. The aim of the study was to compare nutritional status of adults on alternative or on traditional diet and sequels of the diet to body metabolism. The group on alternative diet consisted of 89 lacto-ovo-vegetarians (age 38.7 +/- 0.6 years, average duration of vegetarianism 7.8 years). Control group on traditional diet (omnivores, n = 84) was formed as an average sample. Nutritional regime was determined using dietetic questionnaire on the food intake regularity. Vegetarians consume optimal amount of fat (along with recommendations of OVD) with predominance of vegetal lipids. They have low intake of cholesterol (62.8 mg), recommended ratio of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) 6.5:10.6:8.9 energetic percent. Their ratio of linolic:alpha-linolenic acid (10.4:1) also corresponds with recommendations. In traditional diet, the content of lipids and energy usually exceeds the norm of OVD (by 33% or 19% respectively), cholesterol intake is much higher (512.2 mg, 200 mg is recommended as a maximum). Higher is the amount taken of SFA (11.2 energetic %, recommended 7%), and not sufficient is the intake of alpha-linolenic acid (68% of OVD). People on alternative diet have low plasma levels of risk lipid parameters and significantly higher levels of antisclerotic substances. As a result of significantly higher intake of fruits and vegetables, plant oil, sprouts, seeds, and whole-grain food the plasma levels of antioxidative vitamins are in vegetarians higher then threshold. It reduces the risk of the free-radical disease. On the contrary, vegetarians have deficits in methionine intake, and 15% of them have hypoproteinemia is (0% in omnivores). Low plasma levels of iron and calcium, occurrence of hyposideremia (16% versus 2%) and hypocalcemia (21% versus 8%) corresponds with intake of vegetal absorption inhibitors (fytolic acid, oxalic acid, roughage). Frequently a mild form of hyperhomocysteinemia is found (28% versus 5%), resulting vitamin B12 deficit. Vegetarian diet is optimal for prevention of free-radical diseases, especially those of the cardiovascular system. It may bring a risk from the point of view of low iron and calcium absorption, low intake of methionine and occurrence of mild forms of hyperhomocysteinemia. In traditional diet, total lipid content should be lowered, amount of vegetable oil with alpha-linolenic acid should be elevated as well as fruit and vegetable consummation.

During 0.4 to 1.0 years of treatment there were significant increases in growth velocity and upper arm circumference SD scores, body cell mass (intracellular water calculated as tritium space minus corrected sodium bromide space) and serum transferrin. Blood urea and urea:creatinine ratio fell in all children. Renal function assessed from plasma creatinine and 51Cr EDTA clearance did not change significantly. During treatment there was an increase in plasma calcium, high levels necessitating brief interruption of therapy in two children, and a decrease in plasma phosphate. Levels of serum parathormone fell in all children, and were correlated inversely with plasma calcium and positively with plasma phosphate. Abnormalities compared to control children in blood aminoacid and branched-chain ketoacid levels were unaffected by treatment. These results suggest that a protein-restricted diet supplemented with essential aminoacids and calcium-keto and hydroxyacids may be useful to improve linear growth and nutritional status in children with chronic renal failure, and that a reduction in hyperparathyroidism may be partly responsible for some of the beneficial effects observed.",

Prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open label, single center trial conducted between April 2008 and November 2012 that evaluated efficacy of retapamulin ointment 1% in the treatment of impetigo, folliculitis, and other minor soft tissue infections in children and adults. Fifty patients, who presented to a dermatology outpatient clinic and were clinically diagnosed with impetigo, folliculitis, or minor soft tissue infection suitable for treatment with a topical antibiotic, were screened. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled and received treatment: topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days. Seven patients were MRSA positive and qualified for the primary efficacy population. One patient withdrew due to an adverse event. Clinical and microbiological exams were performed at baseline and follow-up 5 to 7 days later to assess clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic responses. Primary outcome was clinical response at follow-up in primary efficacy population with MRSA isolated as the baseline pathogen. Secondary outcomes included clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic responses in patients who were culture positive for any species of bacteria. Clinical response at follow-up in the primary efficacy population (MRSA-positive patients) was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate significance; however, outcomes were excellent, with 7 of 7 patients demonstrating clinical success (5 of 7) or clinical improvement (2 of 7) at follow-up. Barring lack of significance due to small total sample size for patients who were culture positive for any species of bacteria (<i>n</i> = 35), overall success rates were favorable for clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic responses with values of 66%, 97%, and 69%, respectively.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250996": "Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in children two to five years of age. There are two principal types: nonbullous (70% of cases) and bullous (30% of cases). Nonbullous impetigo, or impetigo contagiosa, is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and is characterized by honey-colored crusts on the face and extremities. Impetigo primarily affects the skin or secondarily infects insect bites, eczema, or herpetic lesions. Bullous impetigo, which is caused exclusively by S. aureus, results in large, flaccid bullae and is more likely to affect intertriginous areas. Both types usually resolve within two to three weeks without scarring, and complications are rare, with the most serious being poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Treatment includes topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid. Oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and macrolides are options, but penicillin is not. Natural therapies such as tea tree oil; olive, garlic, and coconut oils; and Manuka honey have been anecdotally successful, but lack sufficient evidence to recommend or dismiss them as treatment options. Treatments under development include minocycline foam and Ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone. Topical disinfectants are inferior to antibiotics and should not be used. Empiric treatment considerations have changed with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, macrolide-resistant streptococcus, and mupirocin-resistant streptococcus all documented. Fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin cover methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and streptococcal infections. Clindamycin proves helpful in suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections.

The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by &lt;or=2 mg/L. At &lt;or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive.

Retapamulin acts as a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis and has a unique mode of antibiotic action. To date, retapamulin has not demonstrated any clinically relevant, target-specific crossresistance with other antibiotic classes, and has shown a low potential for resistance selection in vitro. In preclinical studies, retapamulin demonstrated pronounced in vitro activity against staphylococcal, streptococcal and anaerobic Gram-positive clinical isolates associated with skin and skin structure infections. Clinical pharmacology studies showed low systemic exposure with topical use of retapamulin, and a favorable tolerability profile. In clinical efficacy trials involving pediatric and adult patients who received retapamulin twice daily for five days, retapamulin was highly effective in the treatment of impetigo, secondarily infected traumatic lesions and secondarily infected dermatitis. Further, the clinical efficacy and safety profile of retapamulin was comparable to that of commonly used oral and topical antibiotics. Retapamulin was also clinically effective against isolates resistant to existing therapies.

Here we report an epigenetic crosstalk at enhancers between the UTX (H3K27 demethylase)-MLL4 (H3K4 methyltransferase) complex and the histone acetyltransferase p300. We demonstrate that UTX, in a demethylase activity-independent manner, facilitates conversion of inactive enhancers in embryonic stem cells to an active (H3K4me1<sup>+</sup>/H3K27ac<sup>+</sup>) state by recruiting and coupling the enzymatic functions of MLL4 and p300. Loss of UTX leads to attenuated enhancer activity, characterized by reduced levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac as well as impaired transcription. The UTX-MLL4 complex enhances p300-dependent H3K27 acetylation through UTX-dependent stimulation of p300 recruitment, while MLL4-mediated H3K4 monomethylation, reciprocally, requires p300 function. Importantly, MLL4-generated H3K4me1 further enhances p300-dependent transcription. This work reveals a previously unrecognized cooperativity among enhancer-associated chromatin modulators, including a unique function for UTX, in establishing an \"active enhancer landscape\" and defines a detailed mechanism for the joint deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.",

However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24038352": "Enhancers play a pivotal role in regulating the transcription of distal genes. Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300 and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a fraction of enhancers are functionally active. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. However, the systematic identification of the most informative single modification, or combination thereof, is still lacking. Furthermore, the discovery of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) provides an alternative approach to directly predicting enhancer activity. However, it remains challenging to link chromatin modifications to eRNA transcription. Herein, we develop a logistic regression model to unravel the relationship between chromatin modifications and eRNA synthesis. We perform a systematic assessment of 24 chromatin modifications in fetal lung fibroblast and demonstrate that a combination of four modifications is sufficient to accurately predict eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity. Finally, we apply our fibroblast trained model to six other cell-types and successfully predict eRNA synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate the learned relationships are general and independent of cell-type. We provided a powerful tool to identify active enhancers and reveal the relationship between chromatin modifications, eRNA production and enhancer activity.",

These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22920947": " Transcription regulation in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells is a complex process that involves multitude of regulatory layers, one of which is post-translational modification of histones. Acetylation of specific lysine residues of histones plays a key role in regulating gene expression. Here we have investigated the genome-wide occurrence of two histone marks, acetylation of histone H3K9 and K14 (H3K9ac and H3K14ac), in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Genome-wide H3K9ac and H3K14ac show very high correlation between each other as well as with other histone marks (such as H3K4me3) suggesting a coordinated regulation of active histone marks. Moreover, the levels of H3K9ac and H3K14ac directly correlate with the CpG content of the promoters attesting the importance of sequences underlying the specifically modified nucleosomes. Our data provide evidence that H3K9ac and H3K14ac are also present over the previously described bivalent promoters, along with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. Furthermore, like H3K27ac, H3K9ac and H3K14ac can also differentiate active enhancers from inactive ones. Although, H3K9ac and H3K14ac, a hallmark of gene activation exhibit remarkable correlation over active and bivalent promoters as well as distal regulatory elements, a subset of inactive promoters is selectively enriched for H3K14ac. Our study suggests that chromatin modifications, such as H3K9ac and H3K14ac, are part of the active promoter state, are present over bivalent promoters and active enhancers and that the extent of H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation could be driven by cis regulatory elements such as CpG content at promoters. Our study also suggests that a subset of inactive promoters is selectively and specifically enriched for H3K14ac. This observation suggests that histone acetyl transferases (HATs) prime inactive genes by H3K14ac for stimuli dependent activation. In conclusion our study demonstrates a wider role for H3K9ac and H3K14ac in gene regulation than originally thought.",

Thus accurate prediction of enhancers is important for further understanding of these processes. Genome-wide measurement of epigenetic features, such as histone modifications and occupancy by transcription factors, is improving enhancer predictions, but the contribution of these features to prediction accuracy is not known. Given the importance of the hematopoietic transcription factor TAL1 for erythroid gene activation, we predicted candidate enhancers based on genomic occupancy by TAL1 and measured their activity. Contributions of multiple features to enhancer prediction were evaluated based on the results of these and other studies. TAL1-bound DNA segments were active enhancers at a high rate both in transient transfections of cultured cells (39 of 79, or 56%) and transgenic mice (43 of 66, or 65%). The level of binding signal for TAL1 or GATA1 did not help distinguish TAL1-bound DNA segments as active versus inactive enhancers, nor did the density of regulation-related histone modifications. A meta-analysis of results from this and other studies (273 tested predicted enhancers) showed that the presence of TAL1, GATA1, EP300, SMAD1, H3K4 methylation, H3K27ac, and CAGE tags at DNase hypersensitive sites gave the most accurate predictors of enhancer activity, with a success rate over 80% and a median threefold increase in activity. Chromatin accessibility assays and the histone modifications H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were sensitive for finding enhancers, but they have high false positive rates unless transcription factor occupancy is also included. Occupancy by key transcription factors such as TAL1, GATA1, SMAD1, and EP300, along with evidence of transcription, improves the accuracy of enhancer predictions based on epigenetic features.",

We show that PRC1 components are present in both cases, but at different levels. In particular, active target promoters are nearly devoid of E(z) and Polycomb. Moreover, repressed regions are trimethylated at lysines 9 and 27, suggesting that these histone modifications represent a mark for inactive PcG-controlled regions. These PcG-specific repressive marks are maintained by the action of the E(z) HMT, an enzyme that has an important role not only in establishing but also in maintaining PcG repression.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26305225": "The fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome. Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity.",

We determined the occurrence of SMAD6 variants in all types of craniosynostosis, evaluated the impact of different missense variants on SMAD6 function, and tested independently whether rs1884302 genotype significantly modifies the phenotype. We performed resequencing of SMAD6 in 795 unsolved patients with any type of craniosynostosis and genotyped rs1884302 in SMAD6-positive individuals and relatives.

They can be categorized as nodular (localized) or diffuse type (D-TGCT). Historically, surgery has been the mainstay of therapy, but diffuse type disease recurs at a high rate and treatment often requires increasingly morbid procedures. Elucidation of the importance of the colony-stimulating factor (CSF1)/CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease has created significant interest in targeting this pathway as a novel TGCT treatment approach. Pexidartinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor against CSF1R, showed an 83% disease control rate (52% with partial response and 31% with stable disease) in a recent phase 1 study of patients with TGCT. We present an illustrative example of a TGCT patient who would have required a morbid operation who derived considerable clinical benefit from pexidartinib treatment. Her tumor volume decreased by 48% after 4 months of treatment, and 55 months after starting treatment the patient exhibits continued disease stability with minimal clinical symptoms, and significant improvement in functional status. This case illustrates the effectiveness of systemic therapy in controlling a disease associated with high surgical morbidity. This approach may be especially useful in the treatment of extra-articular disease which often invades neurovascular bundles; as the effectiveness in metastatic disease is still unknown. In the future, systemic treatment for TGCT may be appropriate for the neoadjuvant setting to decrease disease burden prior to surgery with the aim of decreasing recurrence rates.

Therefore, TAM depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion.

Entrectinib binds to TRKA/B/C and ROS1 and is prescribed for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK fusion proteins and for ROS1-postive non-small cell lung cancers. Erdafitinib inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4 and is used in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancers. Pexidartinib is a CSF1R antagonist that is prescribed for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumors. Fedratinib blocks JAK2 and is used in the treatment of myelofibrosis. Overall, the US FDA has approved 52 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of temsirolimus (which is given intravenously) and netarsudil (an eye drop). Of the 52 approved drugs, eleven inhibit protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, two are directed against dual specificity protein kinases, eleven target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 28 block receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 46 of these drugs are used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases (eight against non-solid tumors such as leukemias and 41 against solid tumors including breast and lung cancers; some drugs are used against both tumor types). Eight drugs are employed in the treatment of non-malignancies: fedratinib, myelofibrosis; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; netarsudil, glaucoma; and tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, sirolimus and ibrutinib are used for the treatment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Entrectinib and larotrectinib are tissue-agnostic anti-cancer small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. These drugs are prescribed for the treatment of any solid cancer harboring NTRK1/2/3 fusion proteins regardless of the organ, tissue, anatomical location, or histology type.

This phase I, nonrandomized, open-label multiple-dose study evaluated pexidartinib safety and efficacy in Asian patients with symptomatic, advanced solid tumors. Materials and Methods Patients received pexidartinib: cohort 1, 600 mg/d; cohort 2, 1000 mg/d for 2 weeks, then 800 mg/d. Primary objectives assessed pexidartinib safety and tolerability, and determined the recommended phase 2 dose; secondary objectives evaluated efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile. Results All 11 patients (6 males, 5 females; median age 64, range 23-82; cohort 1 n = 3; cohort 2 n = 8) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event; 5 experienced at least one grade \u2265 3 adverse event, most commonly (18%) for each of the following: increased aspartate aminotransferase, blood alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and anemia. Recommended phase 2 dose was 1000 mg/d for 2 weeks and 800 mg/d thereafter. Pexidartinib exposure, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 8 h (AUC<sub>0-8h</sub>), and maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) increased on days 1 and 15 with increasing pexidartinib doses, and time at C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) was consistent throughout all doses. Pexidartinib exposure and plasma levels of adiponectin and colony-stimulating factor 1 increased following multiple daily pexidartinib administrations. One patient (13%) with tenosynovial giant cell tumor showed objective tumor response. Conclusions This was the first study to evaluate pexidartinib in Asian patients with advanced solid tumors. Pexidartinib was safe and tolerable in this population at the recommended phase 2 dose previously determined for Western patients (funded by Daiichi Sankyo; clinicaltrials.gov number, <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02734433\" title=\"See in ClinicalTrials.gov\">NCT02734433</a>).",

Pexidartinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selective inhibition of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor and is the first systemic therapy to show significant improvement in overall response rates when compared with placebo. Clinicians using pexidartinib should monitor for liver-related adverse events, which may require treatment interruption, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation.

Radiotherapy is associated with important side effects. TGCT cells overexpress colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Pexidartinib (Turalio\u2122) is a selective CSF1 R inhibitor, which was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of TGCT. This article reviews the pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, and safety of pexidartinib. Pexidartinib was effective with an acceptable safety profile for advanced TGCT in phase I-III studies. The phase III trial (ENLIVEN) in unresectable TGCT met its primary endpoints of overall response rate. These results led to FDA approval for this TGCT population. Mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity was observed in rare cases. For this reason, pexidartinib is currently available only through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program in the USA.

The current standard of care for TGCT is surgical resection. However, some patients have tumor recurrence, present with unresectable tumors, or have tumors that are in locations where resection could result in amputations or significant debility. Therefore, the development of systemic agents with activity against TGCT to expand treatment options is a highly unmet medical need. Pathologically, TGCT is characterized by the overexpression of colony\ufeff-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), which leads to the recruitment of colony\ufeff-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) expressing macrophages that make up the primary cell type within these giant cell tumors. The binding of CSF-1 and CSF-1R controls cell survival and proliferation of monocytes and the switch from a monocytic to macrophage phenotype contributing to the growth and inflammation within these tumors. Therefore, molecules that target CSF-1/CSF-1R have emerged as potential systemic agents for the treatment of TGCT. Given the role of macrophages in regulating tumorigenesis, CSF1/CSF1R-targeting agents have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets for solid tumors. Pexidartinib is an orally bioavailable and potent inhibitor of CSF-1R which is one of the most clinically used agents.

We aimed to evaluate pexidartinib, a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, in patients with TGCT to provide them with a viable systemic treatment option, especially in cases that are not amenable to surgical resection. This phase 3 randomised trial had two parts. Part one was a double-blind study in which patients with symptomatic, advanced TGCT for whom surgery was not recommended were randomly assigned via an integrated web response system (1:1) to the pexidartinib or placebo group. Individuals in the pexidartinib group received a loading dose of 1000 mg pexidartinib per day orally (400 mg morning; 600 mg evening) for the first 2 weeks, followed by 800 mg per day (400 mg twice a day) for 22 weeks. Part two was an open-label study of pexidartinib for all patients. The primary endpoint, assessed in all intention-to-treat patients, was overall response at week 25, and was centrally reviewed by RECIST, version 1.1. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.

Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) controls macrophage differentiation, and here we sought to determine the effect of a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, PLX3397, on adipose tissue macrophage levels and understand the impact on glucose homeostasis in mice. A Ten-week-old mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and then treated with PLX3397 via oral gavage (50 mg/kg) every second day for 3 weeks, with subsequent monitoring of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and assessment of adipose tissue immune cells. PLX3397 treatment substantially reduced macrophage numbers in adipose tissue of both chow and high-fat diet fed mice without affecting total myeloid cell levels. Despite this, PLX3397 did not greatly alter glucose homeostasis, did not affect high-fat diet-induced increases in visceral fat cytokine expression (Il-6 and Tnfa) and had limited effect on the phosphorylation of the stress kinases JNK and ERK and macrophage polarization. Our results indicate that macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue induced by a high-fat diet may not be the trigger for impairments in whole body glucose homeostasis, and that anti-CSF1 therapies are not likely to be useful as treatments for insulin resistance.",

The GIT is colonised with microbial communities composed of bacteria, fungi and viruses, collectively known as the GIT microbiota. The GIT microbiota drives multiple interactions locally with immune cells that regulate the homeostatic environment and systemically in diverse tissues. It is becoming evident that the microbiota differs between the sexes, both in animal models and in humans, and these sex differences often lead to sex-dependent changes in local GIT inflammation, systemic immunity and susceptibility to a range of inflammatory diseases.

Jaundice occurs in settings of cholestasis or inability to effectively secrete bile as well as disorders of bilirubin metabolism and hepatocellular dysfunction. Clinical signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/dL.

Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies.

The etiology of jaundice was determined by the pattern of liver biochemistry test abnormalities, radiographic studies, liver biopsy, clinical follow-up, and autopsy. During the study period, 541 HIV-infected patients (511 with AIDS) were evaluated for liver disease by our service; 36 of these patients had jaundice (7 percent). The most common causes of jaundice were drug-induced hepatitis, occurring in 11 patients (31 percent), and alcoholic liver disease, occurring in 5 (13 percent). Opportunistic infections or neoplasms were identified as the cause of jaundice in 11 patients (30 percent), with 4 having intrahepatic disease and 7 having extrahepatic disease. Multiple potential causes were seen in 3 patients. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) were helpful in suggesting the underlying cause of disease.

We have described a method for measuring the optical spectrum of our conjunctiva and derived pigment concentration by using diffused reflection measurement. The method uses no prior model and is expected to work across the races (skin color) encompassing a wide range of age groups. An optical fiber-based setup capable of measuring the conjunctival absorption spectrum from 400 to 800 nm is used to monitor the level of bilirubin and is calibrated with the value measured from blood serum of the same human subject. We have also developed software in the LabVIEW platform for use in online monitoring of bilirubin levels in human subjects by nonexperts. The results demonstrate that relative absorption at 460 and 600 nm has a distinct correlation with that of the bilirubin concentration measured from blood serum. Statistical analysis revealed that our proposed method is in agreement with the conventional biochemical method. The innovative noncontact, low-cost technique is expected to have importance in monitoring jaundice in developing/underdeveloped countries, where the inexpensive diagnosis of jaundice with minimally trained manpower is obligatory.",

The effect of Wnt pathway on osteogenesis relies on their cellular environment and the expression of target genes. However, the molecular mechanism of that remains unclear. On the basis of the preliminary results, we observed the contrary effect of canonical Wnt signaling on osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in the different culture environment. Furthermore, we found that the expression level of miR-17 was also varied with the change in the culture environment. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-17 and canonical Wnt signaling may have potential interactions, particularly the inner regulation relationship in different microenvironments. In this paper, we observed that canonical Wnt signaling promoted osteogenesis of PDLSCs in the fully culture medium, while inhibited it in the osteogenic differentiation medium. Interestingly, alteration in the expression level of endogenous miR-17 could partially reverse the different effect of canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the role of miR-17 was because of its target gene TCF3 (transcription factor 3), a key transcription factor of canonical Wnt pathway. Overexpression of TCF3 attenuated the effect of miR-17 on modulating canonical Wnt signaling. Finally, we elucidated that TCF3 enhanced osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In brief, the different level of miR-17 was the main cause of the different effect of canonical Wnt signaling, and TCF3 was the crucial node of miR-17-canonial Wnt signaling regulation loop. This understanding of microRNAs regulating signaling pathways in different microenvironments may pave the way for fine-tuning the process of osteogenesis in bone-related disorders.",

We have developed a CRC cell line (HCT-R) that, unlike its parental cell line, HCT-116, does not respond to butyrate exposure with hyperactivation of Wnt signaling and suppressed clonal growth. PCR array analyses revealed Wnt pathway-related genes, the expression of which differs between butyrate-sensitive HCT-116 CRC cells and their butyrate-resistant HCT-R cell counterparts. We identified overexpression of Tcf3 as being partially responsible for the butyrate-resistant phenotype, as this DNA-binding protein suppresses the hyperinduction of Wnt activity by butyrate. Consequently, Tcf3 knockdown in HCT-R cells restores their sensitivity to the effects of butyrate on Wnt activity and clonal cell growth. Interestingly, the effects of overexpressed Tcf3 differ between HCT-116 and HCT-R cells; thus, in HCT-116 cells Tcf3 suppresses proliferation without rendering the cells resistant to butyrate. In HCT-R cells, however, the overexpression of Tcf3 inhibits Wnt activity, and the cells are still able to proliferate due to the higher expression levels of cell cycle factors, particularly those driving the G(1) to S transition. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms determining the variable sensitivity of CRC cells to butyrate may assist in developing approaches that prevent or reverse butyrate resistance.",

TCF3 (also known as TCF7L1) is a member of the TCF/LEF transcription factor family that is central in regulating epidermal and embryonic stem cell identity. We found that TCF3 is highly expressed in poorly differentiated human breast cancers, preferentially of the basal-like subtype. This suggested that TCF3 is involved in the regulation of breast cancer cell differentiation state and tumorigenicity. Silencing of TCF3 dramatically decreased the ability of breast cancer cells to initiate tumor formation, and led to decreased tumor growth rates. In culture, TCF3 promotes the sphere formation capacity of breast cancer cells and their self-renewal. We found that in contrast to ES cells, where it represses Wnt-pathway target genes, TCF3 promotes the expression of a subset of Wnt-responsive genes in breast cancer cells while repressing another distinct target subset. In the normal mouse mammary gland, Tcf3 is highly expressed in terminal end buds, structures that lead duct development. Primary mammary cells are dependent on Tcf3 for mammosphere formation, and its overexpression in the developing gland disrupts ductal growth. Our results identify TCF3 as a central regulator of tumor growth and initiation, and a novel link between stem cells and cancer.",

Hesx1 is a conserved vertebrate-specific transcription factor that is required for forebrain development in Xenopus, mice and humans. Mouse embryos deficient for Hesx1 exhibit a variable degree of forebrain defects, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are not fully understood. Here, we show that injection of a hesx1 morpholino into a 'sensitised' zygotic headless (tcf3) mutant background leads to severe forebrain and eye defects, suggesting an interaction between Hesx1 and the Wnt pathway during zebrafish forebrain development. Consistent with a requirement for Wnt signalling repression, we highlight a synergistic gene dosage-dependent interaction between Hesx1 and Tcf3, a transcriptional repressor of Wnt target genes, to maintain anterior forebrain identity during mouse embryogenesis. In addition, we reveal that Tcf3 is essential within the neural ectoderm to maintain anterior character and that its interaction with Hesx1 ensures the repression of Wnt targets in the developing forebrain. By employing a conditional loss-of-function approach in mouse, we demonstrate that deletion of \u03b2-catenin, and concomitant reduction of Wnt signalling in the developing anterior forebrain of Hesx1-deficient embryos, leads to a significant rescue of the forebrain defects. Finally, transcriptional profiling of anterior forebrain precursors from mouse embryos expressing eGFP from the Hesx1 locus provides molecular evidence supporting a novel function of Hesx1 in mediating repression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin target activation in the developing forebrain.",

How external signals connect to this regulatory circuitry to influence ES cell fate is not known. We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog. Thus, Tcf3 is an integral component of the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells, which includes an autoregulatory loop involving the pluripotency regulators. Both Tcf3 depletion and Wnt pathway activation cause increased expression of Oct4, Nanog, and other pluripotency factors and produce ES cells that are refractory to differentiation. Our results suggest that the Wnt pathway, through Tcf3, brings developmental signals directly to the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells to influence the balance between pluripotency and differentiation.",

We demonstrate that Tcf3 can inhibit beta-catenin turnover via its competition with axin and adenomatous polyposis for beta-catenin binding. A mutant of beta-catenin that cannot bind Tcf3 is degraded faster than the wild-type protein in Xenopus embryos and extracts. A fragment of beta-catenin and a peptide encoding the NH2 terminus of Tcf4 that block the interaction between beta-catenin and Tcf3 stimulate beta-catenin degradation, indicating this interaction normally plays an important role in regulating beta-catenin turnover. Tcf3 is a substrate for both glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 and casein kinase (CK) 1epsilon, and phosphorylation of Tcf3 by CKIepsilon stimulates its binding to beta-catenin, an effect reversed by GSK3. Tcf3 synergizes with CK1epsilon to inhibit beta-catenin degradation, whereas CKI-7, an inhibitor of CK1epsilon, reduces the inhibitory effect of Tcf3. Finally, we provide evidence that CK1epsilon stimulates the binding of dishevelled (dsh) to GSk3 binding protein (GBP) in extracts. Along with evidence that a significant amount of Tcf protein is nonnuclear, these findings suggest that CK1epsilon can modulate wnt signaling in vivo by regulating both the beta-catenin-Tcf3 and the GBP-dsh interfaces.",

Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of Vitamin A, has a critical function in initiating lineage differentiation of ESCs through binding to the retinoic acid receptors. Additionally, the Wnt signaling pathway plays a role in pluripotency and differentiation, depending on the activation status of the canonical and noncanonical pathways. The activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which requires the nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin and its interaction with Tcf1/Lef at Wnt response elements, is involved in ESC stemness maintenance. The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, through actions of Tcf3, can antagonize the canonical pathway. We show that RA activates the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, while concomitantly inhibiting the canonical pathway. RA increases the expression of ligands and receptors of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (Wnt 5a, 7a, Fzd2 and Fzd6), downstream signaling, and Tcf3 expression. RA reduces the phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin levels by fourfold, although total \u03b2-catenin levels do not change. We show that RA signaling increases the dissociation of Tcf1 and the association of Tcf3 at promoters of genes that regulate stemness (e.g., NR5A2, Lrh-1) or differentiation (e.g. Cyr61, Zic5). Knockdown of Tcf3 increases Lrh-1 transcript levels in mESCs and prevents the RA-associated, fourfold increase in Zic5, indicating that RA requires Tcf3 to effect changes in Zic5 levels. We demonstrate a novel role for RA in altering the activation of these two Wnt signaling pathways and show that Tcf3 mediates some actions of RA during differentiation.",

It has been reported that Wnt/catenin signaling plays an indispensable role in human or rat pelages development and postnatal growth. However, the distribution of some Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway factors and their relationship with the epithelial stem cell markers in whisker follicles has not been characterized.

In this study, the effects of inhibition of TCF3 transcription factor on the stemness of mouse ESCs (mESCs) were investigated using the decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) strategy. The TCF3 decoy and its scramble ODNs were designed and synthesized. The interaction specificity of the TCF3 decoy with the TCF3 transcription factor was evaluated by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Subcellular localization was carried out using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. Self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), cell cycle and apoptosis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), embryoid body (EB) formation, and real-time assays. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The results showed that knockdown of TCF3 by decoy ODNs transfection in mESCs led to an increase in the cell proliferation, ALP enzyme activity, and master regulatory stemness genes and a decrease in the number and diameter of EBs. These results supported TCF3 as a potential target to maintain the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of mESCs.

According to the consensus view, the Wnt pathway prevents the degradation of the key signaling component \u03b2-catenin by the protein complex containing the negative regulators Axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Stabilized \u03b2-catenin associates with TCF proteins and enters the nucleus to promote target gene expression. This study examines the involvement of HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) in the regulation of different TCF proteins in Xenopus embryos in vivo. We show that the TCF family members LEF1, TCF4, and TCF3 are phosphorylated in embryonic ectoderm after Wnt8 stimulation and HIPK2 overexpression. We also find that TCF3 phosphorylation is triggered by canonical Wnt ligands, LRP6, and dominant negative mutants for Axin and GSK3, indicating that this process shares the same upstream regulators with \u03b2-catenin stabilization. HIPK2-dependent phosphorylation caused the dissociation of LEF1, TCF4, and TCF3 from a target promoter in vivo. This result provides a mechanistic explanation for the context-dependent function of HIPK2 in Wnt signaling; HIPK2 up-regulates transcription by phosphorylating TCF3, a transcriptional repressor, but inhibits transcription by phosphorylating LEF1, a transcriptional activator. Finally, we show that upon HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation, TCF3 is replaced with positively acting TCF1 at a target promoter. These observations emphasize a critical role for Wnt/HIPK2-dependent TCF phosphorylation and suggest that TCF switching is an important mechanism of Wnt target gene activation in vertebrate embryos.",

To explain these paradoxical observations, we explored the gene regulatory networks at play. Canonical Wnt signaling is intertwined with the pluripotency network comprising Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 in mouse ESCs. In defined media supporting the derivation and propagation of ESCs, Tcf3 and \u03b2-catenin interact with Oct4; Tcf3 binds to Sox motif within Oct-Sox composite motifs that are also bound by Oct4-Sox2 complexes. Furthermore, canonical Wnt signaling upregulates the activity of the Pou5f1 distal enhancer via the Sox motif in ESCs. When viewed in the context of published studies on Tcf3 and \u03b2-catenin mutants, our findings suggest Tcf3 counters pluripotency by competition with Sox2 at these sites, and Tcf3 inhibition is blocked by \u03b2-catenin entry into this complex. Wnt pathway stimulation also triggers \u03b2-catenin association at regulatory elements with classic Lef/Tcf motifs associated with differentiation programs. The failure to activate these targets in the presence of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor essential for ESC culture suggests MEK/ERK signaling and canonical Wnt signaling combine to promote ESC differentiation.",

We show that menin is essential for canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cultured rodent islet tumor cells. In these cells, overexpression of menin significantly enhances TCF gene assay reporter activity in response to beta-catenin activation. Contrastingly, inhibition of menin expression with Men1 siRNA decreases TCF reporter gene activity. Likewise, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 disease associated missense mutations of menin abrogate the ability to increase TCF reporter gene activity. We show that menin physically interacts with proteins involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, including beta-catenin, TCF3 (TCFL1), and weakly with TCF4 (TCFL2). Menin overexpression increases expression of the Wnt/beta-catenin downstream target gene Axin2, which is associated with increased H3K4 trimethylation of the Axin2 gene promoter. Moreover, inhibition of menin expression by siRNA abrogates H3K4 trimethylation and Axin2 gene expression. Based on these studies, we hypothesized that Wnt signaling could inhibit islet cell proliferation because loss of menin function is thought to increase endocrine tumor cell proliferation. TGP61 rodent islet tumor cells treated with a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitor that increases Wnt pathway signaling had decreased cell proliferation compared with vehicle-treated cells. Collectively, these data suggest that menin has an essential role in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling through a mechanism that eventually affects histone trimethylation of the downstream target gene Axin2, and activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibits islet tumor cell proliferation.",

In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Wnt signaling preferentially maintains \"stemness\" under certain permissive conditions. T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs. Despite the wealth of knowledge regarding the importance of Wnt signaling underlying stem cells functions, the precise mechanistic explanation by which the effects are mediated is unknown. In this study, we identified new regulatory targets of Tcf3 using a whole-genome approach and found that Tcf3 transcriptionally represses many genes important for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal, as well as those involved in lineage commitment and stem cell differentiation. This effect is in part mediated by the corepressors transducin-like enhancer of split 2 and C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP). Notably, Tcf3 binds to and represses the Oct4 promoter, and this repressive effect requires both the Groucho and CtBP interacting domains of Tcf3. Interestingly, we find that in mouse preimplantation development embryos, Tcf3 expression is coregulated with Oct4 and Nanog and becomes localized to the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. These data demonstrate an important role for Tcf3 in modulating the appropriate level of gene transcription in ESCs and during embryonic development.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) present a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase. This is due to the lack of expression of cell cycle inhibitors, which ultimately determines na\u00efve pluripotency by holding back differentiation. The canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway controls mESC pluripotency via the Wnt-effector Tcf3. However, if the activity of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin controls the cell cycle of mESCs remains unknown. Here we show that the Wnt-effector Tcf1 is recruited to and triggers transcription of the Ink4/Arf tumor suppressor locus. Thereby, the activation of the Wnt pathway, a known mitogenic pathway in somatic tissues, restores G1 phase and drastically reduces proliferation of mESCs without perturbing pluripotency. Tcf1, but not Tcf3, is recruited to a palindromic motif enriched in the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes, such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a and p19Arf, which mediate the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs.

In this study, we genetically define Tcf3-\u03b2-catenin functions in mice by generating a Tcf3\u0394N knock-in mutation that specifically ablates Tcf3-\u03b2-catenin. Mouse embryos homozygous for the knock-in mutation (Tcf3(\u0394N/\u0394N)) progress through gastrulation without apparent defects, thus genetically proving that Tcf3 function during gastrulation is independent of \u03b2-catenin interaction. Tcf3(\u0394N/\u0394N) mice were not viable, and several post-gastrulation defects revealed the first in vivo functions of Tcf3-\u03b2-catenin interaction affecting limb development, vascular integrity, neural tube closure and eyelid closure. Interestingly, the etiology of defects indicated an indirect role for Tcf3-\u03b2-catenin in the activation of target genes. Tcf3 directly represses transcription of Lef1, which is stimulated by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity. These genetic data indicate that Tcf3-\u03b2-catenin is not necessary to activate target genes directly. Instead, our findings support the existence of a regulatory circuit whereby Wnt/\u03b2-catenin counteracts Tcf3 repression of Lef1, which subsequently activates target gene expression via Lef1-\u03b2-catenin complexes. We propose that the Tcf/Lef circuit model provides a mechanism downstream of \u03b2-catenin stability for controlling the strength of Wnt signaling activity during embryonic development.",

We observed that the repressor activity of mouse Tcf3 was only relieved effectively upon simultaneous disruption of both mechanisms. Immunofluorescence of transfected HEK 293 cells showed co-localization of \u03b2-catenin and Tcf3 in the nucleus of cells transfected with full-length Tcf3, but not in cells transfected with N-terminal deleted versions.

We have previously shown that mutation in the Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor gene constitutively activates Wnt signaling in ESCs and inhibits their capacity to differentiate towards ecto-, meso-, and endodermal lineages. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms through which Wnt regulates lineage differentiation in mouse ESCs remain to date largely unknown. To this aim, we have derived and studied the gene expression profiles of several Apc-mutant ESC lines encoding for different levels of Wnt signaling activation. We found that down-regulation of Tcf3, a member of the Tcf/Lef family and a key player in the control of self-renewal and pluripotency, represents a specific and primary response to Wnt activation in ESCs. Accordingly, rescuing Tcf3 expression partially restored the neural defects observed in Apc-mutant ESCs, suggesting that Tcf3 down-regulation is a necessary step towards Wnt-mediated suppression of neural differentiation. We found that Tcf3 down-regulation in the context of constitutively active Wnt signaling does not result from promoter DNA methylation but is likely to be caused by a plethora of mechanisms at both the RNA and protein level as shown by the observed decrease in activating histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3-acetylation) and the upregulation of miR-211, a novel Wnt-regulated microRNA that targets Tcf3 and attenuates early neural differentiation in mouse ESCs.

Production of the appropriate number of neurons without depletion of the NPC population requires precise regulation of the balance between differentiation and maintenance of NPCs. However, the mechanism that suppresses Wnt signaling to prevent premature neuronal differentiation of NPCs is poorly understood. We now show that the HMG box transcription factor Tcf3 (also known as Tcf7l1) contributes to this mechanism. Tcf3 is highly expressed in undifferentiated NPCs in the mouse neocortex, and its expression is reduced in intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs) committed to the neuronal fate. We found Tcf3 to be a repressor of Wnt signaling in neocortical NPCs in a reporter gene assay. Tcf3 bound to the promoter of the proneural bHLH gene Neurogenin1 (Neurog1) and repressed its expression. Consistent with this, Tcf3 repressed neuronal differentiation and increased the self-renewal activity of NPCs. We also found that Wnt signal stimulation reduces the level of Tcf3, and increases those of Tcf1 (also known as Tcf7) and Lef1, positive mediators of Wnt signaling, in NPCs. Together, these results suggest that Tcf3 antagonizes Wnt signaling in NPCs, thereby maintaining their undifferentiated state in the neocortex and that Wnt signaling promotes the transition from Tcf3-mediated repression to Tcf1/Lef1-mediated enhancement of Wnt signaling, constituting a positive feedback loop that facilitates neuronal differentiation.",

Here, we aimed to investigate the molecular signaling associated with Wnt16b and ROR1 overexpression in TCF3-PBX1 cell lines and primary samples, and to identify effective treatment options via ROR1 targeting. We detected higher ROR1 expression on TCF3-PBX1 leukemic cells even at a later stage of patient relapse, providing a strong rationale for the use of ROR1-targeted therapy.

Wnt16b also activated the RhoA/Rac1 signaling cascade suggesting the activation of a non-canonical Wnt pathway in TCF3-PBX1 cells. Wnt16 could interact with ROR1 but not in TCF3-PBX1 cells, suggesting that Wnt5a is the ligand signaling via ROR1 in TCF3-PBX1 cells. By high throughput drug-sensitivity testing of TCF3-PBX1 cells before and after ROR1 knockdown we found that targeting ROR1 significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy of Bcl-2 family inhibitors venetoclax and navitoclax, and this synergism was confirmed ex vivo using a drug-resistant primary sample from a relapsed TCF3-PBX1 patient. Our work underlines a new type of targeted combination therapy that could be clinically advantageous for patients with TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL.",

In adult skin, quiescent multipotent progenitors express Tcf3 and commit to a hair cell fate in response to Wnt signaling. We find that embryonic skin progenitors also express Tcf3. Using an inducible system in mice, we show that upon Tcf3 reactivation, committed epidermal cells induce genes associated with an undifferentiated, Wnt-inhibited state and Tcf3 promotes a transcriptional program shared by embryonic and postnatal SCs. Further, Tcf3-repressed genes include transcriptional regulators of the epidermal, sebaceous gland and hair follicle differentiation programs, and correspondingly, all three terminal differentiation pathways are suppressed when Tcf3 is induced postnatally. These data suggest that in the absence of Wnt signals, Tcf3 may function in skin SCs to maintain an undifferentiated state and, through Wnt signaling, directs these cells along the hair lineage.",

All known JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. Here, we used the recently identified JBTS-associated protein armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 (ARMC9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies JBTS. In addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners. We found that TOGARAM1 variants cause JBTS and disrupt TOGARAM1 interaction with ARMC9. Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and cold-induced depolymerization in ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 patient cell lines suggest a role for this new JBTS-associated protein module in ciliary stability.",

However, its low dose radiation may pose a low but non-zero risk of tumor induction in pediatric patients. Here, we present a systematic literature review on the estimated incidence of brain tumor induction from head CT exams performed on children and adolescents. MEDLINE was searched using an electronic protocol and bibliographic searches to identify articles related to CT, cancer, and epidemiology or risk assessment. Sixteen studies that predicted or measured head CT-related neoplasm incidence or mortality were identified and reviewed. Epidemiological studies consistently cited increased tumor incidence in pediatric patients (ages 0-18) exposed to head CTs. Excess relative risk of new brain tumor averaged 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.93) for pediatric patients exposed to one or more head CTs. Tumor incidence increased with number of pediatric head CTs in a dose-dependent manner, with measurable excess incidence even after a single scan. Converging evidence from epidemiological studies supported a small excess risk of brain tumor incidence after even a single CT exam in pediatric patients. However, refined epidemiological methods are needed to control for confounding variables that may contribute to reverse causation, such as patients with pre-existing cancer or cancer susceptibility. CT remains an invaluable technology that should be utilized so long as there is clinical indication for the study and the radiation dose is as small as reasonably achievable.",

However, these complex and sometimes lengthy procedures are performed under fluoroscopic guidance and thus unavoidably expose vulnerable pediatric patients to the effects of ionizing radiation. Recent epidemiologic evidence from a national registry of children who underwent CT scans suggests a higher-than-expected incidence of secondary tumors. We sought to calculate the predicted risk of secondary tumors in a large cohort of pediatric neurointerventional patients. We reviewed our cohort of pediatric neurointerventions, tabulated radiation dose delivered to the skin, and calculated the range of likely brain-absorbed doses by use of previously developed mathematical models. The predicted risk of secondary tumor development as a function of brain-absorbed dose in this cohort was then generated by use of the head CT registry findings. Maximal skin dose and brain-absorbed doses in our cohort were substantially lower than have been previously described. However, we found 1) a statistically significant correlation between radiation dose and age at procedure, as well as number and type of procedures, and 2) a substantial increase in lifetime predicted risk of tumor above baseline in the cohort of young children who undergo neurointerventions. Although neurointerventional procedures have dramatically improved the prognosis of children facing serious cerebrovascular conditions, the predicted risk of secondary tumors, particularly in the youngest patients and those undergoing multiple procedures, is sobering.",

Materials and Methods The study was approved by the local ethics committee. A cohort of 26 370 subjects was retrospectively collected from a radiology archive of CT examinations of the head performed from 1973 through 1992. For comparison, an age- and sex-matched cohort of 96 940 subjects who were not exposed to CT (unexposed cohort) was gathered. The risk of meningioma was assessed by using data from the Swedish Cancer Registry; however, one-third of patients with meningioma had to be excluded because they either had a prevalent meningioma or other brain tumor at the first CT examination or had undergone radiation treatment to the head. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated from time of exposure to the occurrence of meningioma or death or until December 31, 2010, with logistic regression. Results Comparison of exposed and unexposed cohorts showed that there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of meningioma after exposure to CT of the head (HR: 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.97, 2.30; P = .07). If incident cases at the time of the first CT examination were not excluded, the risk of meningioma would have been falsely increased (HR: 2.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.56, 3.33; P = .0001).

Pubmed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed from the date of their inception to January 2014. Additionally, manual searches of bibliographies were performed and topic experts were contacted. Data were obtained from studies measuring or estimating the risks of malignancy associated with radiation from head and/or neck CT in pediatric populations according to an a priori protocol. Two independent evaluators corroborated the extracted data. There were 16 criterion-meeting studies that included data from n = 858,815 patients. The radiation-related risk of malignancy was estimated using primary patient data for both the exposure and outcome in a minority of studies, with most analyses utilizing mathematical modeling techniques. The data regarding otolaryngology-specific studies were limited and suggested a borderline significant increase in the risk of all combined cancers after facial CT (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28) and neck/spine CT (IRR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.28). Cohort data suggest that 1 excess brain malignancy occurred after 4000 brain CTs (40 mSv per scan) and that the estimated risk in the 10 years following CT exposure was 1 brain tumor per 10,000 patients exposed to a 10 mGy scan at less than 10 years of age.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19018153": " We aimed to estimate the risks of radiation exposure from a single head CT scan to children of different ages. We constructed a multistate time-dependent Markov model to simulate the course of children exposed to a head CT. The relevant literature was reviewed for probabilities, which were used to calculate tumor types, latencies after exposure and outcomes in the model. Where multiple approximations of the same probability had been reported, meta-analytic techniques were employed to compute pooled estimates. The model was then used to calculate the effect of the radiation exposure on life expectancy and quality of life for children following head CT at different ages. The tumors likely to be induced by low-level cranial irradiation include thyroid carcinoma (47%), meningioma (34%) and glioma (19%). According to the model, a single head CT is likely to cause one of these tumors in 0.22% of 1-year-olds, 30% of whom will consequently die. The exposure will shorten the life expectancy of all exposed 1-year-olds by an average of 0.04 years and their expected quality of life by 0.02 quality-adjusted life years. The risks of radiation exposure diminish for older children. The model predicts that the effective radiation dose from a single head CT is capable of inducing a thyroid or brain tumor in an infant or child. These tumors can severely impact both quality of life and life expectancy. Care should be taken before ordering CT scans in children, particularly in infants and toddlers.",

From 2011 to 2015, we performed a case-control study of 120 brain tumour patients and 360 appendicitis patients as controls. Reasons, the number of brain and head CT scans date were available from interviews. A cumulative radiation dose to the brain was calculated as a sum of doses received from head CT scans and from conventional X-rays and estimated using a reference table derived from a literature review of published studies. We performed conditional logistic regression to assess the risk of brain tumours from brain and head CT, and from conventional head X-ray procedures. The case group received on average 1.8 CTs to the brain area and 2.2 CTs to the whole head, with a mean estimated brain dose of 32 \u00b113 mGy. The odds ratio for developing a brain tumour from having a brain CT was 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.38-1.82). This was hardly altered when adjusting for parental educational history and for other diseases (history of neurological disease and attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). Neither whole head CT nor cumulative brain dose to the brain increased the risk of glioma or of all brain tumours. Although this study conducted in Japan, where ranks second in the number of CT scans conducted in the world, did not show an increased risk of brain tumours related to CT scans, it should be taken with caution due to a case-control study with limited sample size.",

We reviewed seven studies that described and analyzed the risk of brain tumors. A positive correlation between exposure to CT scans and developing central nervous system tumors was evident in all cohorts. The strength of the association varied across the studies. Exclusion of patients with predisposing factors to central nervous system tumors was examined in four studies with a decreased risk to develop central nervous system tumors noted in three studies. Two studies reported nonsignificant reduction in the excess relative risk per milliGray of brain dose after adjusting for predisposing factors, whereas the reduction was significant in one study. The frequency of CT exposure was proportional to the risk of developing tumors in two studies although not significantly maintained in two other studies. Gender had no significant effect on the central nervous system tumor risk. The calendar year at the time of imaging showed decreasing risk in those exposed to CT in more recent years compared with prior decades.

Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using cancer incidence rates from the general Dutch population. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100 mGy organ dose were calculated with Poisson regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Standardized incidence ratios were elevated for all cancer sites. Mean cumulative bone marrow doses were 9.5 mGy at the end of follow-up, and leukemia risk (excluding myelodysplastic syndrome) was not associated with cumulative bone marrow dose (44 cases). Cumulative brain dose was on average 38.5 mGy and was statistically significantly associated with risk for malignant and nonmalignant brain tumors combined (ERR/100 mGy: 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.20 to 2.22, P = .002, 84 cases).

These syndromes might be confounders because they are associated with an increased cancer risk and may increase the likelihood of CT scans performed in children. We identify CSS predisposing to leukemia and brain tumors through a systematic literature search and summarize prevalence and risk estimates. Because there is virtually no empirical evidence in published literature on patterns of CT use for most types of CSS, we estimate confounding bias of relative risks (RR) for categories of radiation exposure based on expert opinion about the current and previous patterns of CT scans among CSS patients. We estimate that radiation-related RRs for leukemia are not meaningfully confounded by Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or other CSS. In contrast, RRs for brain tumors may be overestimated due to confounding by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) while von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, or other CSS do not meaningfully confound. Empirical data on the use of CT scans among CSS patients are urgently needed. Our assessment indicates that associations with leukemia reported in previous studies are unlikely to be substantially confounded by unmeasured CSS, whereas brain tumor risks might have been overestimated due to confounding by TSC. Future studies should identify TSC patients in order to avoid overestimation of brain tumor risks due to radiation exposure from CT scans.",

The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs <i>in vitro</i> and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC<sub>50</sub>) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC<sub>50</sub> The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same <i>in vitro</i> resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group \u03b2-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV <i>in vitro</i> and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.",

The most advanced compound is lefamulin, which is in late-stage development for the intravenous and oral treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin infections.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A2780 and Caov-3 human ovarian carcinoma cells were cultured with and without 40, 160, and 200 \u03bcM of pleuromutilin. The Edu fluorescence assay, the wound-healing assay, and Matrigel were used to measure A2780 and Caov-3 cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion in vitro, respectively. Western blot measured protein levels of FAK, p-FAK, MMP-2, and MMP-9. A2780 cells were injected subcutaneously into mice to determine the effects of pleuromutilin on the growth of tumor xenografts. RESULTS Pleuromutilin significantly reduced A2780 and Caov-3 cell proliferation at 48 h in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.05), and at 200 \u03bcM, pleuromutilin reduced cell proliferation by 21.43% and 23.65%, respectively. Treatment of A2780 cells with pleuromutilin significantly reduced cell migration, invasion, and adhesion and the expression of p-FAK, MMP-2, and MMP-9 compared with untreated controls. In the mouse tumor xenograft model, treatment with pleuromutilin significantly reduced tumor size compared with the untreated group and inhibited tumor metastasis to the intestine, spleen, and peritoneal cavity. CONCLUSIONS In A2780 and Caov-3 human ovarian carcinoma cells, pleuromutilin inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion in a dose-dependent manner, and reduced tumor growth and metastases in a mouse A2780 cell tumor xenograft model.",

Sall1 positively regulates and synergizes with Nanog for gene transcriptional regulation. In addition, our data show that Sall1 suppresses the ectodermal and mesodermal differentiation. Specifically, the induction of the gastrulation markers T brachyury, Goosecoid, and Dkk1 and the neuroectodermal markers Otx2 and Hand1 was inhibited by Sall1 overexpression during embryoid body differentiation.

Overexpression of porcine OTX2 can reduce the percentage of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies and downregulate <i>NANOG</i> and <i>OCT4</i> expression. In contrast, knockdown of <i>OTX2</i> can significantly increase endogenous expressions of <i>NANOG</i>, <i>OCT4</i>, and <i>ESRRB</i>, and stabilize the pluripotent state of piPSCs. On the other hand, NANOG can directly bind to the <i>OTX2</i> promoter as shown in ChIP-seq data and repress <i>OTX2</i> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. These observations indicate that OTX2 and NANOG can form a negative feedback circuitry to regulate the pluripotency of porcine iPS cells.",

Recently, we developed a differential gene activating multifunctional small molecule SAHA-PIP (S\u03b4) by conjugating a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, SAHA, to a selective DNA-binding pyrrole-imidazole polyamide (PIP). Epigenetic activity of S\u03b4 was attributed to the active metal-binding (-NHOH) domain of SAHA. We synthesized a derivative of S\u03b4, called J\u03b4 to evaluate the role of surface recognition domain (-phenyl) of SAHA in S\u03b4-mediated transcriptional activation. In vitro studies revealed that J\u03b4 displayed potent inhibitory activity against HDAC8. J\u03b4 retained the pluripotency gene-inducing ability of S\u03b4 when used alone and in combination with S\u03b4; a notable increase in the pluripotency gene expression was observed. Interestingly, J\u03b4 significantly induced the expression of HDAC8-controlled Otx2 and Lhx1. Our results suggest that the epigenetic activity of our multifunctional molecule could be altered to improve its efficiency as a transcriptional activator for intricate gene network(s).",

Studies have revealed that the ESC state is maintained by a dynamic mechanism characterized by cell-to-cell spontaneous and reversible differences in sensitivity to self-renewal and susceptibility to differentiation. This metastable condition ensures indefinite self-renewal and, at the same time, predisposes ESCs for differentiation to EpiSCs. Despite considerable advances, the molecular mechanism controlling the ESC state and pluripotency transition from ESCs to EpiSCs have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that Otx2, a transcription factor essential for brain development, plays a crucial role in ESCs and EpiSCs. Otx2 is required to maintain the ESC metastable state by antagonizing ground state pluripotency and promoting commitment to differentiation. Furthermore, Otx2 is required for ESC transition into EpiSCs and, subsequently, to stabilize the EpiSC state by suppressing, in pluripotent cells, the mesendoderm-to-neural fate switch in cooperation with BMP4 and Fgf2. However, according to its central role in neural development and differentiation, Otx2 is crucially required for the specification of ESC-derived neural precursors fated to generate telencephalic and mesencephalic neurons. We propose that Otx2 is a novel intrinsic determinant controlling the functional integrity of ESCs and EpiSCs.",

The features of authentic piPSCs and molecular events during the reprogramming are largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the transcriptome profile of multiple piPSC lines derived from different laboratories worldwide and compared to mouse and human iPSCs to determine the molecular signaling pathways that might play a central role in authentic piPSCs. The results demonstrated that the up-regulation of endogenous epithelial cells adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was correlated with the pluripotent state of pig pluripotent cells, which could be utilized as a marker for evaluating pig cell reprogramming. Comparison of key signaling pathways JAK-STAT, NOTCH, TGFB1, WNT and VEGF in pig, mouse and human iPSCs showed that the core transcriptional network to maintain pluripotency and self-renewal in pig were different from that in mouse, but had significant similarities to human. Pig iPSCs, which lacked expression of specific na\u00efve state markers KLF2/4/5 and TBX3, but expressed the primed state markers of Otx2 and Fabp7, share defining features with human ESCs and mouse EpiSCs. The cluster of imprinted genes delineated by the delta-like homolog 1 gene and the type III iodothyronine deiodinase gene (DLK1-DIO3) were silenced in piPSCs as previously seen in mouse iPSCs that have limited ability to contribute to chimaeras. These key differences in na\u00efve state gene and imprinting gene expression suggests that so far known piPSC lines may be more similar to primed state cells. The primed state of these cells may potentially explain the rare ability of piPSCS to generate chimeras and cloned offspring.",

The process of early neural differentiation in hESCs begins by initiation of primitive neuroectoderm, which is manifested by rosette formation, with consecutive differentiation into neural progenitors and early glial-like cells. In this study, we examined the involvement of early neural markers - OTX2, PAX6, Sox1, Nestin, NR2F1, NR2F2, and IRX2 - in the onset of rosette formation, during spontaneous neural differentiation of hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies. This is in contrast to the conventional way of studying rosette formation, which involves induction of neuronal differentiation and the utilization of embryoid bodies. Here we show that OTX2 is highly expressed at the onset of rosette formation, when rosettes comprise no more than 3-5 cells, and that its expression precedes that of established markers of early neuronal differentiation. Importantly, the rise of OTX2 expression in these cells coincides with the down-regulation of the pluripotency marker OCT4. Lastly, we show that cells derived from rosettes that emerge during spontaneous differentiation of hESCs or hiPSCs are capable of differentiating into dopaminergic neurons in vitro, and into mature-appearing pyramidal and serotonergic neurons weeks after being injected into the motor cortex of NOD-SCID mice.",

We know a lot about the complex transcriptional control circuits that maintain the naive pluripotent state under self-renewing conditions but comparatively less about how cells exit from this state in response to differentiation stimuli. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency. Otx2 drives enhancer activation through affecting chromatin marks and the activity of associated genes. Mechanistically, Oct4 is required for Otx2 expression, and reciprocally, Otx2 is required for efficient Oct4 recruitment to many enhancer regions. Therefore, the Oct4-Otx2 regulatory axis actively establishes a new regulatory chromatin landscape during the early events that accompany exit from ground state pluripotency.",

Although core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Here we uncover a role for Otx2 in the control of the naive pluripotent state. We analyzed Otx2-binding activity in ESCs and EpiSCs and identified Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 as direct targets. To unravel the Otx2 transcriptional network, we targeted the strongest Otx2-binding site in the Nanog promoter, finding that this site modulates the size of specific ESC-subtype compartments in cultured cells and promotes Nanog expression in vivo, predisposing ICM differentiation to epiblast. Otx2-mediated Nanog regulation thus contributes to the integrity of the ESC state and cell lineage specification in preimplantation development.",

In this study, we generated iPSCs from human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) by electroporation with episomal plasmid vectors encoding OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC together with p53 suppression. Intriguingly, cell reprogramming resulted in a metastable transcriptional activation and selective demethylation of neural and retinal specification-associated genes, such as OTX2, RX1 and SIX3. In contrast, RPE progenitor genes were transcriptionally silent in HDFs and descendant iPSCs. Overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 directly stimulated the expression of OTX2, RX1 and SIX3 in HDFs and iPSCs. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further identified an OCT4- and two SOX2-binding sites located in the proximal promoter of OTX2. Histone acetylation and methylation on the local promoter also participated in the reactivation of OTX2. The transcriptional conversion of RX1 and SIX3 genes partially attributed to DNA demethylation. Subsequently, iPSCs were induced into the RPE cells displaying the characteristics of polygonal shapes and pigments, and expressing typical RPE cell markers. Taken together, our results establish readily efficient and safe protocols to produce iPSCs and iPSC-derived RPE cells, and underline that the reactivation of anterior neural transcription factor OTX2, eye field transcription factor RX1 and SIX3 in iPSCs is a feature of pluripotency acquisition and predetermines the potential of RPE differentiation.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732856": "The enhancer landscape is dramatically restructured as naive preimplantation epiblasts transition to the post-implantation state of primed pluripotency. A key factor in this process is Otx2, which is upregulated during the early stages of this transition and ultimately recruits Oct4 to a different set of enhancers. In this study, we discover that the acetylation status of Oct4 regulates the induction of the primed pluripotency gene network. Maintenance of the naive state requires the NAD-dependent deacetylase, SirT1, which deacetylates Oct4. The activity of SirT1 is reduced during the naive-to-primed transition; Oct4 becomes hyper-acetylated and binds to an Otx2 enhancer to induce Otx2 expression. Induction of Otx2 causes the reorganization of acetylated Oct4 and results in the induction of the primed pluripotency gene network. Regulation of Oct4 by SirT1 may link stem cell development to environmental conditions, and it may provide strategies to manipulate epiblast cell state.",

Endogenous factors that regulate and maintain the expression of master TFs in hESCs remain largely unknown and/or uncharacterized. Here, we use a genome-wide, proteomics approach to identify proteins associated with the OCT4 enhancer. We identify known OCT4 regulators, plus a subset of potential regulators including a zinc finger protein, ZNF207, that plays diverse roles during development. In hESCs, ZNF207 partners with master pluripotency TFs to govern self-renewal and pluripotency while simultaneously controlling commitment of cells towards ectoderm through direct regulation of neuronal TFs, including OTX2. The distinct roles of ZNF207 during differentiation occur via isoform switching. Thus, a distinct isoform of ZNF207 functions in hESCs at the nexus that balances pluripotency and differentiation to ectoderm.",

Recent advances in single cell profiling allow detailed analysis of embryogenesis in other eutherian species, including human, to distinguish conserved from divergent regulatory programs and signalling pathways in the rodent paradigm. Here, we identify and compare transcriptional features of human, marmoset and mouse embryos by single cell RNA-seq. Zygotic genome activation correlates with the presence of polycomb repressive complexes in all three species, while ribosome biogenesis emerges as a predominant attribute in primate embryos, supporting prolonged translation of maternally deposited RNAs. We find that transposable element expression signatures are species, stage and lineage specific. The pluripotency network in the primate epiblast lacks certain regulators that are operative in mouse, but encompasses WNT components and genes associated with trophoblast specification. Sequential activation of GATA6, SOX17 and GATA4 markers of primitive endoderm identity is conserved in primates. Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and non-human primate blastocysts.

Here we address the above-mentioned issues in the first steps of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. We observed that the expression of <i>Lin28</i> genes is transiently induced soon after the exit of ESCs from the naive ground state and that this induction is due to the Hmga2-dependent engagement of Otx2 with enhancers present at both <i>Lin28</i> gene loci. These mechanisms are crucial for Lin28 regulation, as demonstrated by the abolishment of the Lin28 accumulation in Otx2- or Hmga2-knockout cells compared to the control cells. We have also found that Lin28 controls Hmga2 expression levels during ESC differentiation through a let-7-independent mechanism. Indeed, we found that Lin28 proteins bind a highly conserved element in the 3' UTR of Hmga2 mRNA, and this provokes a down-regulation of its translation. This mechanism prevents the inappropriate accumulation of Hmga2 that would modify the proliferation and physiological apoptosis of differentiating ESCs. In summary, we demonstrated that during ESC differentiation, Lin28 transient induction is dependent on Otx2 and Hmga2 and prevents an inappropriate excessive rise of Hmga2 levels.-Parisi, S., Passaro, F., Russo, L., Musto, A., Navarra, A., Romano, S., Petrosino, G., Russo, T.

This heterogeneity reflects the dynamic condition of ESCs and their versatility to promptly respond to signaling effectors promoting naive or primed pluripotency. Here, we report that ESCs lacking Nanog or overexpressing Otx2 exhibit an early primed identity in LIF + FBS and fail to convert into 2i-induced naive state. Conversely, Otx2-null ESCs possess naive identity features in LIF + FBS similar to Nanog-overexpressing ESCs and convert poorly into FGF-induced early primed state. When both Nanog and Otx2 are inactivated, ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS exhibit primed identity and weakened ability to convert into naive state. These data suggest that, through mutual antagonism, NANOG and OTX2 specify the heterogeneous identity of ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS and individually predispose them for optimal response to naive or primed inducing factors.",

Here, we demonstrate that transition between these two pluripotent states is associated with widespread Oct4 relocalization, mirrored by global rearrangement of enhancer chromatin landscapes. Our genomic and biochemical analyses identified candidate mediators of primed state-specific Oct4 binding, including Otx2 and Zic2/3. Even when differentiation cues are blocked, premature Otx2 overexpression is sufficient to exit the naive state, induce transcription of a substantial subset of primed pluripotency-associated genes, and redirect Oct4 to previously inaccessible enhancer sites. However, the ability of Otx2 to engage new enhancer regions is determined by its levels, cis-encoded properties of the sites, and the signaling environment. Our results illuminate regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotency and suggest that the capacity of transcription factors such as Otx2 and Oct4 to pioneer new enhancer sites is highly context dependent.",

To reveal the regulatory function of OTX2 in porcine reprogrammed cells, we screened porcine miRNA-seq databases and found two miRNAs, miR-1343 and miR-545, that could specifically bind to 3'UTR of OTX2 and suppress endogenous OTX2 expression in piPSCs. Knockdown of OTX2 by miR-1343 and miR-545 could significantly increase the expression of SOX2 and ESRRB, but did not alter the expressions of OCT4 and KLF4, and improve the pluripotency of piPSCs. The promoter-based assays showed that OTX2 potentially bound to the promoter region of SOX2 and ESRRB and suppressed their expression. On the other hand, SOX2 could interact with OTX2 promoter. Ectopic expression of SOX2 could significantly decrease OTX2 promoter activity, showing that there is a negative feedback loop between SOX2 and OTX2. Additionally, SOX2 and ESRRB significantly stimulated miR-1343 expression in piPSCs, but OTX2 down regulated the expression of miR-1343 in either direct or indirect manners. In summary, this study demonstrates that there is a regulatory network mediated by miR-1343, in which downregulation of OTX2 by miR-1343 can elevate the expression of pluripotent genes that were then sustain the pluripotency of piPSCs.",

Differential phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and cell fate decisions on exposure to bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) suggested that a novel pluripotent identity has been established with 2iL. Accordingly, cESCs cultured with 2iL formed colonies at a greater efficiency than LIF-FGF2 cESCs following single-cell dissociation. Total genomic DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation signals were reduced in 2iL-treated cESCs.

How pluripotency progression and morphogenesis are linked and whether intermediate pluripotent states exist remain controversial. We identify here a rosette pluripotent state defined by the co-expression of naive factors with the transcription factor OTX2. Downregulation of blastocyst WNT signals drives the transition into rosette pluripotency by inducing OTX2. The rosette then activates MEK signals that induce lumenogenesis and drive progression to primed pluripotency. Consequently, combined WNT and MEK inhibition supports rosette-like stem cells, a self-renewing naive-primed intermediate. Rosette-like stem cells erase constitutive heterochromatin marks and display a primed chromatin landscape, with bivalently marked primed pluripotency genes. Nonetheless, WNT induces reversion to naive pluripotency. The rosette is therefore a reversible pluripotent intermediate whereby control over both pluripotency progression and morphogenesis pivots from WNT to MEK signals.",

Variants in half of the SOX genes have been shown to cause severe developmental and adult syndromes, referred to as SOXopathies. We here provide evidence that SOX6 variants also cause a SOXopathy. Using clinical and genetic data, we identify 19 individuals harboring various types of SOX6 alterations and exhibiting developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; the individuals are from 17 unrelated families. Additional, inconstant features include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, mild facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis, and multiple osteochondromas. All variants are heterozygous. Fourteen are de novo, one is inherited from a mosaic father, and four offspring from two families have a paternally inherited variant.

Four missense variants occur in residues and protein regions highly conserved evolutionarily. These variants are not detected in the gnomAD control cohort, and the amino acid substitutions are predicted to be damaging. Two of these variants are located in the HMG domain and abolish SOX6 transcriptional activity in vitro. No clear genotype-phenotype correlations are found.

Significant progress in research of this tumor and appropriate treatment is associated with determining the various molecular categories of primary medulloblastomas. This analysis includes certain factors of cytogenetic and transcriptional proliferation. Modern treatment approaches for patients older than 3 years include advanced resection, craniospinal irradiation with a boost on the postoperative bed followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Conventional radiotherapy including craniospinal irradiation results a significant number of complications. Morbidity rate is increased throughout long-term follow-up. Secondary tumors including glioblastomas are under special attention since their occurrence is associated with a fatal outcome. This may partially explaine the fact that chemotherapy without repeated morphological verification doesn't always ensure tumor growth control in patients with recurrent medulloblastomas. The authors consider irradiation-induced glioblastomas secondary to primarily verified medulloblastomas in patients who had previously undergone craniospinal irradiation as a component of combined treatment after tumor resection. It was found that the incidence of this phenomenon is significant and made up about 10% among patients with recurrent medulloblastomas. This value is significantly higher compared to previous data. The authors analyzed patterns of occurrence of irradiation-induced glioblastomas depending on the molecular genetic group and clinical characteristics of patients after primary surgery.

Outcomes of radiation-induced sGBM remain poor in both children and adults. We report a case of a 16-year-old girl with a history of disseminated juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma treated with chemotherapy and craniospinal radiation 9 years prior who developed sGBM in the absence of a tumor predisposition syndrome. She presented with a several-week history of headaches and no acute findings on computed tomography compared to baseline neuroimaging 3 months prior. Repeat computed tomography performed just 3 weeks later for worsening headaches revealed a new large posterior fossa tumor where pathology confirmed the diagnosis of sGBM. In spite of maximal surgical resection, reirradiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy, she died 1 year postdiagnosis. Our case highlights the potential late effects of high-dose cranial radiation, how symptomatology may precede neuroimaging findings, and the rapid formation of sGBM that mirrors that of de novo Glioblastoma Multiforme.",

Childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), characterized by frequent central nervous system involvement, is a well documented disease for the effect of prophylactic cranio-spinal irradiation. Irradiation, however, acts as an oncogenic factor as a delayed effect and it is rare that glioblastoma multiforme develops during the remission period of ALL. We experienced a pediatric radiation-induced GBM patient which developed during the remission period of ALL, who were primarily treated with chemotherapeutic agents and brain radiation therapy for the prevention of central nervous system (CNS) relapse.

Although patients can expect long-term survival, the adverse effects of radiotherapy and late sequelae in survivors are a major concern. Radiation-induced secondary neoplasms are one of those sequelae and are a serious concern because they are often connected directly with life prognosis. We describe a case of radiation-induced glioblastoma after radiotherapy for germinoma. An 11-year-old boy with basal ganglia germinoma was successfully treated with postoperative cranial irradiation. At the age of 40 years, he was admitted to our hospital for aphasia and memory disturbance. CT and MRI revealed a tumor in the left parietal lobe with dissemination. The tumor of the parietal lobe was removed surgically, and pathohistologically, it was diagnosed as glioblastoma. Long-term survivors who receive radiotherapy for germinomas in childhood are at risk for late complications, including radiation-induced neoplasms. Therefore, careful follow-up neurological examinations are recommended in these patients, even 20-30 years after radiotherapy.",

Paradoxically, radiation is also a risk factor for GBM development, raising the possibility that radiotherapy of brain tumors could promote tumor recurrence or trigger secondary gliomas. In this study, we determined whether tumor suppressor losses commonly displayed by patients with GBM confer susceptibility to radiation-induced glioma. Mice with Nestin-Cre-driven deletions of <i>Trp53</i> and <i>Pten</i> alleles were intracranially irradiated with X-rays or charged particles of increasing atomic number and linear energy transfer (LET). Mice with loss of one allele each of <i>Trp53</i> and <i>Pten</i> did not develop spontaneous gliomas, but were highly susceptible to radiation-induced gliomagenesis. Tumor development frequency after exposure to high-LET particle radiation was significantly higher compared with X-rays, in accordance with the irreparability of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced by high-LET radiation. All resultant gliomas, regardless of radiation quality, presented histopathologic features of grade IV lesions and harbored populations of cancer stem-like cells with tumor-propagating properties. Furthermore, all tumors displayed concomitant loss of heterozygosity of <i>Trp53</i> and <i>Pten</i> along with frequent amplification of the <i>Met</i> receptor tyrosine kinase, which conferred a stem cell phenotype to tumor cells. Our results demonstrate that radiation-induced DSBs cooperate with preexisting tumor suppressor losses to generate high-grade gliomas. Moreover, our mouse model can be used for studies on radiation-induced development of GBM and therapeutic strategies. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uncovers mechanisms by which ionizing radiation, especially particle radiation, promote GBM development or recurrence.",

The first case is a male survivor of an orbital rhabdomyosarcoma who developed a meningioma 8 years later. The other two cases are female survivors of ependymomas who were irradiated at the age of 3 and developed secondary gliomas 8 and 17 years after therapy respectively.

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and pathological aspects of 11 patients who underwent cranial irradiation (range, 24-110 cGy) to treat their primary disease and thereafter developed secondary tumours within a span of 13 years. All tumours arose within the previous radiation fields, and satisfied the widely used criteria for the definition of radiation-induced neoplasms. There was no sex predominance (M: 5, F: 6) and the patients tended to be young at irradiation (1.3-42 years; median age: 22 years). The median latency period before the detection of the secondary tumour was 14.5 years (range: 6.5-24 years). Meningiomas developed in 5 patients, sarcomas in 4, and malignant gliomas in 2. A pre-operative diagnosis of a secondary tumour was correctly obtained in 10 patients based on the neuro-imaging as well as nuclear medicine findings. All patients underwent a surgical removal of the secondary tumour, 3 underwent additional chemotherapy, and one received stereotactic secondary irradiation therapy. During a median of 2 years of follow-up review after the diagnosis of a secondary tumour, 3 patients died related to the secondary tumours (2 sarcomas, 1 glioblastoma), one died of a recurrent primary glioma, while the remaining 7 have been alive for from 10 months to 12 years after being treated for the secondary tumours (median: 3 years).

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15685439": "Gliomas of astrocytic, oligodendroglial and ependymal origin account for more than 70% of all brain tumors. The most frequent (65%) and most malignant histological type is the glioblastoma. Since the introduction of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the incidence rates of brain tumors have been rather stable, with a tendency of higher rates in highly developed, industrialized countries. Some reports indicate that Caucasians have higher incidence than black or Asian populations, but to some extent, this may reflect socio-economic differences and under-ascertainment in some regions, rather than a significant difference in genetic susceptibility. With the exception of pilocytic astrocytomas, the prognosis of glioma patients is still poor. Less than 3% of glioblastoma patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis, higher age being the most significant predictor of poor outcome. Brain tumors are a component of several inherited tumor syndromes, but the prevalence of these syndromes is very low. Several occupations, environmental carcinogens, and diet (N-nitroso compounds) have been reported to be associated with an elevated glioma risk, but the only environmental factor unequivocally associated with an increased risk of brain tumors, including gliomas, is therapeutic X-irradiation. In particular, children treated with X-irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia show a significantly elevated risk of developing gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), often within 10 years after therapy. TP53 mutations are frequent in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas derived therefrom. Approximately 60% of mutations are located in the hot spot codons 248 and 273, and the majority of these are G:C--&gt;A:T transitions at CpG sites. TP53 mutations are significantly more frequent in low-grade astrocytomas with promoter methylation of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase repair gene, suggesting that, in addition to deamination of 5-methylcytosine, exogenous or endogenous alkylation in the O(6) position of guanine may contribute to the formation of these mutations.",

All patients received craniospinal irradiation followed by local boost and the median dose to the initial tumor area was 54.0 Gy (range, 49.8-60.6 Gy). Four patients (two medulloblastomas, one germinoma, and one NGGCT) received chemotherapy. Second brain tumors were diagnosed a median of 114 months (range, 64-203) after initial radiation. Pathologic diagnoses were one glioblastoma, two cases of anaplastic astrocytoma, one medulloblastoma, one low-grade glioma, one high-grade glial tumor, and one atypical meningioma. Five patients underwent surgical resection with subsequent radiotherapy. One anaplastic astrocytoma patient received chemotherapy only following stereotactic biopsy. The meningioma patient was alive 32 months after total resection and radiosurgery for subsequent recurrences. Six patients died within 18 months and most deaths were due to disease progression. Most patients diagnosed with second brain tumors had received high-dose, large-volume radiotherapy with chemotherapy at a young age.

While investigative therapies that aim at dissolving aggregates have failed, and the promises of silencing expression of ND associated pathogenic proteins or the deployment of engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are still in the horizon, emerging literature suggests degrading aggregates through autophagy-related mechanisms hold the current potential for a possible cure. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is an intracellular degradative pathway where superfluous or unwanted cellular cargoes (such as peroxisomes, mitochondria, ribosomes, intracellular bacteria and misfolded protein aggregates) are wrapped in double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes that eventually fuses with lysosomes for their degradation. The selective branch of autophagy that deals with identification, capture and degradation of protein aggregates is called aggrephagy. Here, we cover the workings of aggrephagy detailing its selectivity towards aggregates. The diverse cellular adaptors that bridge the aggregates with the core autophagy machinery in terms of autophagosome formation are discussed. In ND, essential protein quality control mechanisms fail as the constituent components also find themselves trapped in the aggregates. Thus, although cellular aggrephagy has the potential to be upregulated, its dysfunction further aggravates the pathogenesis. This phenomenonwhen combined with the fact that neurons can neither dilute out the aggregates by cell division nor the dead neurons can be replaced due to low neurogenesis, makes a compelling case for aggrephagy pathway as a potential therapeutic option.",

A screen for small molecule modulators for aggrephagy identified ERR\u03b1 inverse agonist XCT 790, that cleared \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in an autophagy dependent, but mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) independent manner. XCT 790 modulates autophagosome formation in an ERR\u03b1 dependent manner as validated by siRNA mediated knockdown and over expression approaches. We show that, in a basal state, ERR\u03b1 is localized on to the autophagosomes and upon autophagy induction by XCT 790, this localization is lost and is accompanied with an increase in autophagosome biogenesis. In a preclinical mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), XCT 790 exerted neuroprotective effects in the dopaminergic neurons of nigra by inducing autophagy to clear toxic protein aggregates and, in addition, ameliorated motor co-ordination deficits.

However, it is largely unknown how misfolded polypeptides form aggresomes and are eventually cleared by the aggresome-macroautophagy/autophagy pathway, so-called aggrephagy. Our recent study revealed that when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is impaired, the accumulated misfolded polypeptides are selectively recognized and transported to the aggresome by a CED complex. This complex is composed of CTIF, originally identified as a specific factor for nuclear cap-binding protein complex (a heterodimer of NCBP1/CBP80 and NCBP2/CBP20)-dependent translation (CT), and its associated factors EEF1A1 and DCTN1. Aggresomal targeting of a misfolded polypeptide via the CED complex is accompanied by CTIF release from the CT complex and thereby inhibits CT efficiency. Therefore, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the crosstalk between translational inhibition and aggresome formation under the influence of a misfolded polypeptide.",

We reviewed the relationship between ABO blood groups and thrombus burden in patients with STEMI. We carried out a retrospective study of 396 patients with STEMI who did not have an ABO blood group or thrombus burden. The ABO blood type of all participants was determined. First, angiographic characteristics ranging from a nonexistent thrombus to total occlusion were defined as grades 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, using the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) scoring system. After wiring and/or small balloon dilation, the patients were split into two groups according to the TIMI grade: large thrombus burden (LTB) (TIMI 4, n=66) and small thrombus burden (STB) (TIMI 0-3, n=330). The prevalence rates of ABO blood and Rh types were similar between the groups (P&gt;0.05). Moreover, no relationship was found between thrombus burden and the ABO blood group. The ABO blood group was not an independent predictor of large thrombus burden.

We have previously developed waveguide-mode (WM) sensors for forward ABO and Rh(D) blood typing and detection of antibodies against hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. In this study, we evaluated a WM-sensor for reverse ABO blood typing. Since reverse ABO blood typing is a method for detection of antibodies against type A and type B oligosaccharide antigens on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs), we fixed a synthetic type A or type B trisaccharide antigen on the sensor chip of the WM sensor. We obtained significant changes in the reflectance spectra from a WM sensor on type A antigen with type B plasma and type O plasma and on type B antigen with type A plasma and type O plasma, and no spectrum changes on type A antigen or type B antigen with type AB plasma. Signal enhancement with the addition of a peroxidase reaction failed to increase the sensitivity for detection on oligosaccharide chips. By utilizing hemagglutination detection using regent type A and type B RBCs, we successfully determined reverse ABO blood groups with higher sensitivity compared to a method using oligosaccharide antigens. Thus, functionality of a portable device utilizing a WM sensor can be expanded to include reverse ABO blood typing and, in combination with forward ABO typing and antivirus antibody detection, may be useful for on-site blood testing in emergency settings.",

We evaluated the ABO and Rhesus D antigen (RhD) blood types in a large cohort of chronic HF patients (n = 3,815). ABO blood type distribution in the HF population was not significantly different to that reported in the general national population (A 40%, B 20%, AB 8%, and O 33%). The percentage of Rh-negative per blood type was also similar (A 10%, B 9%, AB 10%, and O 7%). Patients with type O were more likely to be hypertensive compared with non-O type. Mean follow-up was 4.2 years. Overall survival during follow-up was 55%. Cox regression analysis after adjustment for significant predictors demonstrated that RhD-negative was associated with a worse prognosis in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 2,881, 76%): hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.53, p = 0.02.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study included 3,944 patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2015 and with known blood type. Clinical and demographic patient data included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status. The breast tumor type, size, grade, TNM stage, and the presence of lymph node and distant metastases were noted. Histopathology of the breast tumors had included routine detection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen receptor (ER) levels. RESULTS The 3,944 patients with breast cancer were blood group, type A, B, O, and Rh-positive or Rh-negative; the median age was 47.9 years (range, 18.2-89.6 years); 99.5% (3923/3,844) were women, and 0.5% (21/3944) were men. Patients with blood type 0 had a significantly smaller tumor size compared with patients with blood types A or B. There were no significant differences between blood groups and patient age, BMI, menopausal status, tumor histology, ER status, HER2 status, lymph node and distant metastasis. However, there was a significant difference in the prevalence of lobular breast cancer, levels of ER-positive tumor cells, and prevalence of cases with tumor metastases in Rh-positive patients compared with Rh-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this retrospective study showed that the type, grade, stage, and hormonal status of breast cancer showed no significant associations with ABO blood grouping.",

A total of 124 patients with AML who were followed-up between 2010 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients' characteristics were recorded, including age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, smoking history, and ABO blood group. Baseline laboratory test results, including serum creatinine, AST, ALT, platelet, neutrophil and lymphocyte count, were used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and De Ritis ratio. The Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between variables and tumor growth. The study population comprised 71 women and 44 men with a median age of 47.3 (28-65) years. Among patients classified according to the blood groups, no significant differences were observed regarding age, BMI, smoking history, co-morbidities, NLR, PLR, De Ritis ratio, eGFR, or tumor size and localisation. The mean growth rate from baseline to the last scan was 0.36 \u00b1 0.27 cm, 0.21 \u00b1 0.21 cm, 0.14 \u00b1 0.11 cm, and 0.19 \u00b1 0.17 cm for blood type O, A, B, and AB, respectively.

Type A and type B antigens are Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac, respectively, and the enzyme CMAH participating in the synthesis of Neu5Gc from Neu5Ac is associated with this cat blood group system. Rare type AB erythrocytes express both Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac. Cat serum contains naturally occurring antibodies against antigens occurring in the other blood types. To understand the molecular genetic basis of this blood group system, we investigated the distribution of AB blood group antigens, CMAH gene structure, mutation, diplotypes, and haplotypes of the cat CMAH genes. Blood-typing revealed that 734 of the cats analyzed type A (95.1%), 38 cats were type B (4.9%), and none were type AB. A family of three Ragdoll cats including two type AB cats and one type A was also used in this study. CMAH sequence analyses showed that the CMAH protein was generated from two mRNA isoforms differing in exon 1. Analyses of the nucleotide sequences of the 16 exons including the coding region of CMAH examined in the 34 type B cats and in the family of type AB cats carried the CMAH variants, and revealed multiple novel diplotypes comprising several polymorphisms. Haplotype inference, which was focused on non-synonymous SNPs revealed that eight haplotypes carried one to four mutations in CMAH, and all cats with type B (n = 34) and AB (n = 2) blood carried two alleles derived from the mutated CMAH gene. These results suggested that double haploids selected from multiple recessive alleles in the cat CMAH loci were highly associated with the expression of the Neu5Ac on erythrocyte membrane in types B and AB of the feline AB blood group system.",

We investigated the role of blood group antigens in diversifying the glycosylation of buccal epithelial cells (BEC) that line the oral cavity. Specifically, we characterized and statistically evaluated the expression of histo-blood group (A, B, O) antigens on N-and O-linked glycans from BEC membrane proteins of various individuals that represented different blood group type and secretor status using a porous graphitic carbon liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PGC-LC-ESI-MS) based glycomics approach. From these BEC membrane proteins a total of 77 N-glycan and 96 O-glycan structures were structurally characterized from 19 individuals and relatively quantitated. The N-glycans from the secretor individuals did not express any A/B blood group determinants, but contained several terminal H-antigens. Apart from the non-secretors, the N-glycan profiles of BEC from all blood groups displayed similar glycan types, while varying in their relative intensities between individuals. However, multivariate analysis of the O-glycans from individuals displayed segregation patterns clearly associated with their blood group type and secretor status.

The antigens were not expressed in normal follicular or C-cells but were expressed to a various extent in MTC. The studies revealed some characteristic anomalies in the frequency and patterns of tumor-associated antigen expression. The MoAB C 50 stained 32 of the 38 tumors, H type 1 (Le(d)) was demonstrated in 21 and the Le(b) antigen in 27. The Le(a)- and the A antigen were detected in 10 and 12 tumors and the B antigen in one. From the results some rules about the pathways for tumor-associated re-expression of these antigens can be deduced. Le(a) antigen expression was significantly correlated with the CA 50 and Le(b) antigens. The significant relation observed between A-, H1-, and Le(b) antigen formation in MTC suggests the existence of a carcinoma-associated fucosyltransferase committing the type 1 precursor chain along the H1-antigen pathway, and by further glycosylation to an A-, B-, or a Le(b) antigen. Comparative studies of tumor-associated H type 1 and H type 2 antigen expression revealed that H type 2 antigen synthesis was significantly related to a blood type 0 in the host. On the other hand, H1 antigen reactivity was independent of the AB0 blood type of the hosts and was also detected in H type 2 antigen-negative tumors. These findings support the proposal that even in tumor tissue, H antigen expression is still determined by the interaction of at least two different genes. Despite the occurrence of the precursor substance (CA 50) and the formation of the Le(a)- and Le(b) antigens, indicating the presence of a alpha 1,4-fucosyl-transferase (Lewis-enzyme), only two tumors showed the formation of CA 19-9. In conclusion, the investigations demonstrated the dominant re-expression of three type 1 chain-derived structures in MTC, namely H type 1, Le(b), and CA 50. These findings support the general concept demonstrated in other carcinomas, that fucosyl- and sialyltransferases are preferentially activated in MTC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27599872": "Associations between blood type and disease have been studied since the early 1900s when researchers determined that antibodies and antigens are inherited. In the 1950s, the chemical identification of the carbohydrate structure of surface antigens led to the understanding of biosynthetic pathways. The blood type is defined by oligosaccharide structures, which are specific to the antigens, thus, blood group antigens are secondary gene products, while the primary gene products are various glycosyltransferase enzymes that attach the sugar molecules to the oligosaccharide chain. Blood group antigens are found on red blood cells, platelets, leukocytes, plasma proteins, certain tissues, and various cell surface enzymes, and also exist in soluble form in body secretions such as breast milk, seminal fluid, saliva, sweat, gastric secretions, urine, and amniotic fluid. Recent advances in technology, biochemistry, and genetics have clarified the functional classifications of human blood group antigens, the structure of the A, B, H, and Lewis determinants and the enzymes that produce them, and the association of blood group antigens with disease risks. Further research to identify differences in the biochemical composition of blood group antigens, and the relationship to risks for disease, can be important for the identification of targets for the development of nutritional intervention strategies, or the identification of druggable targets.

Stratified squamous epithelium of the exocervix and columnar epithelium of the endocervix in some, but not all specimens showed staining for terminal alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, alpha-D-galactose, beta-D-galactose and alpha-L-fucose. The staining for alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine and alpha-galactose, the terminal sugars in blood group A and B antigens respectively, corresponded to a large extent with ABO blood type. One exception was the lack of staining for terminal alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine in endocervical secretions in three of nine blood type A patients. A second exception was the staining for terminal alpha-galactose in endocervical secretions in about half of blood type O and A specimens. The type and amount of glycoprotein formed by endocervical columnar cells differed according to location in superficial compared with deep portions of the glands and according to location at the junction with exocervix compared with the more internal regions. Staining of endothelial cells for blood group A and B antigens was confined to subjects of blood type A and B respectively, although three of nine type A specimens showed no lectin reactivity for group A antigen. Endothelial cells evidenced affinity for Ulex europeus I agglutinin demonstrative of fucose in all specimens. Mast cells disclosed lectin affinity consistent with the presence of terminal or internal mannose or N-acetylglucosamine residues. Two blood type O specimens were examined with conjugated lectins at the ultrastructural level. Secretory granules stained for content of terminal alpha-galactose, beta-galactose and fucose. These results support and concur with biochemical studies of complex carbohydrates in human cervical tissues. They reveal, in addition, the location of the blood group antigens in the human exocervix and endocervix and the marked heterogeneity among endocervical columnar cells in glycoprotein production.",

The first alteration seen during pancreatic tumor induction in the hamster model is proliferation of poorly differentiated ductular (tubular) structures intermingled with endocrine cells, a pattern consistent with findings in the embryonic and fetal pancreas. However, unlike the fetal tissue, various cell types of intestinal epithelium appear in the advance stages of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Moreover, contrary to the situation in the fetal and adult hamster pancreas, the induced pancreatic lesion expresses antigens with human blood group type specificities, including A, B, H, Leb, Lex, and Ley, antigens that are expressed, however, by fetal and adult duodenal epithelium. Considering the origin of the pancreas from the duodenal mucosa, the overall findings indicate that during pancreatic carcinogenesis some genes, acquired from the progenitor (duodenal) cells, which are inactive in embryonic and normal pancreatic cells, are activated, possibly as a function of some oncogenes. Comparative studies in human tissue lead to the same conclusion.",

ABO secretor refers to those who secrete ABO blood group antigens based on their blood type in body fluids such as saliva, sweat, tears, semen, and serum. Previous studies showed that nonsecretor people are more prone to certain autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the ABO secretor status in the saliva of patients with pemphigus vulgaris. This case-control study was conducted on 35 patients with pemphigus vulgaris and 35 healthy controls. The two groups were matched for age and gender. Pemphigus vulgaris diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology and direct immunofluorescence microscopy. ABO blood grouping was done, and 5 ml of unstimulated saliva was collected to determine secretor status. Secretors were recognized from nonsecretors by the Wiener agglutination inhibition test. Results were extracted by using statistical chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. 16 male and 19 female patients aged 49.43 \u00b1 .12.37 years were compared with 16 male and 19 female controls aged 46.43 \u00b1 11.88 years. The most frequent blood group among case and control groups was O (54.3% and 60%, respectively). There was no significant difference in blood groups (<i>P</i>=0.73). 90% of the samples were ABO secretors. The patient group included 31 (88.6%) and the control group included 32 (91.4%) ABO secretors; there was no significant difference between the two groups (<i>P</i>=1.000).

The expression of blood group-related antigens (A, B, H, Lewis(a), Lewis(b), Lewis(x), Lewis(y), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen) was investigated immunohistochemically in 75 cases of cholangiocarcinoma (31 peripheral type and 44 hilar type). In non-neoplastic bile ducts, A, B, and H antigens were expressed in large bile ducts, while Lewis(a,b,y) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were variably expressed in both large and small bile ducts. Lewis(x) and carcinoembryonic antigen was not found in non-neoplastic bile ducts. In cholangiocarcinomas, A, B, and H, antigens were more frequent in the hilar type than in the peripheral type, although the difference was not significant. The expression of the blood-group related antigens, particularly A, Lewis(a,b,y), carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, was frequent in the tumour cells in well differentiated adenocarcinomas, while their immunoreactivity was less frequent in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. The superanuclear and luminal expression of these antigens in carcinoma cells was frequent in well differentiated adenocarcinomas, and the diffuse, cell membranous and stromal expression of these antigens was relatively frequent in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinoma. The A, B, and H immunoreactivity of both non-neoplastic bile ducts and cholangiocarcinomas was consistent with the host blood group type. These findings suggest that both the expression and intracellular distribution of blood group-related antigens in cholangiocarcinoma are related to the differentiation of cholangiocarcinoma and, possibly, to the parent structure.",

Compatible antigen expression was found in 82, 75, and 50% of tumors from patients with A, B, and O blood group types, respectively. Deletion of the compatible antigen was found in 10 (33%) of the cases, predominantly in patients of blood group O type, and incompatible expression (of B antigen only) in 4 (13%). Lea was detected in 87%, Leb in 90%, Lex in 30%, and Ley in 43% of the specimens, regardless of ABH and Lewis phenotype of the patients. Coexpression of Lea and Leb was found in 87%, of Lex and Ley in 13%, of Lea and Lex in 23%, and of Leb and Ley in 40% of the cases.

The expression of these genes both from the endogenous locus and from transgenes is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR). The LCR encompasses 5 major HSs, each of which is highly homologous among humans, mice, and other mammals. To analyze the function of individual HSs in the endogenous murine beta-globin LCR, we have used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to produce 5 mouse lines, each of which is deficient for 1 of these major HSs. In this report, we demonstrate that deletion of the conserved region of 5'HS 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5/6 abolishes HS formation at the deletion site but has no influence on the formation of the remaining HSs in the LCR. Therefore, in the endogenous murine locus, there is no dominant or initiating site whose formation must precede the formation of the other HSs. This is consistent with the idea that HSs form autonomously. We discuss the implications of these findings for current models of beta-globin regulation.",

The LCR encompasses 6 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) that bind transcription factors. These HSs each contain a core of a few hundred base pairs (bp) that has most of the functional activity and exhibits high interspecies sequence homology. Adjoining the cores are 500- to 1000-bp \"flanks\" with weaker functional activity and lower interspecies homology. Studies of human beta-globin transgenes and of the endogenous murine locus show that deletion of an entire HS (core plus flanks) moderately suppresses expression. However, human transgenes in which only individual HS core regions were deleted showed drastic loss of expression accompanied by changes in chromatin structure. To address these disparate results, we have deleted the core region of 5'HS2 from the endogenous murine beta-LCR. The phenotype was similar to that of the larger 5'HS2 deletion, with no apparent disruption of chromatin structure. These results demonstrate that the greater severity of HS core deletions in comparison to full HS deletions is not a general property of the beta-LCR.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12324650": "The human beta-globin locus is a complex genetic system widely used for analysis of eukaryotic gene expression. The locus consists of five functional beta-like globin genes, epsilon, (G)gamma, (A)gamma, delta, and beta, arrayed on the chromosome in the order that they are expressed during ontogeny. Globin gene expression is regulated, in part, by the locus control region, which physically consists of five DNaseI-hypersensitive sites located 6-22 Kb upstream of the epsilon -globin gene. During ontogeny two switches occur in beta-globin gene expression that reflect the changing oxygen requirements of the fetus. The first switch from embryonic epsilon - to fetal gamma-globin occurs at six weeks of gestation. The second switch from gamma- to adult delta- and beta-globin occurs shortly after birth. Throughout the locus, cis-acting elements exist that are dynamically bound by trans-acting proteins, including transcription factors, co-activators, repressors, and chromatin modifiers. Discovery of novel erythroid-specific transcription factors and a role for chromatin structure in gene expression have enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of globin gene switching. However, the hierarchy of events regulating gene expression during development, from extracellular signaling to transcriptional activation or repression, is complex. In this review we attempt to unify the current knowledge regarding the interplay of cis-acting elements, transcription factors, and chromatin modifiers into a comprehensive overview of globin gene switching.",

The functional mechanism by which the beta-globin LCR stimulates transcription of the linked beta-like globin genes remains unknown. The LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (5'HSs) that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors. These HSs are conserved among mammals, bind transcription factors that also bind to other parts of the locus, and compose the functional components of the LCR. To test the hypothesis that individual HSs have unique properties, homologous recombination was used to construct 5 lines of mice with individual deletions of each of the 5'HSs of the endogenous murine beta-globin LCR. Here it is reported that deletion of 5'HS1 reduces expression of the linked genes by up to 24%, while deletion of 5'HS4 leads to reductions of up to 27%. These deletions do not perturb the normal stage-specific expression of genes from this multigenic locus. In conjunction with previous studies of deletions of the other HSs and studies of deletion of the entire LCR, it is concluded that (1) none of the 5'HSs is essential for nearly normal expression; (2) none of the HSs is required for proper developmental expression; and (3) the HSs do not appear to synergize either structurally or functionally, but rather form independently and appear to contribute additively to the overall expression from the locus.",

We have sequenced regions flanking the beta-globin locus in both mouse and human and found that homology associated with the LCR is more extensive than previously known, making up a conserved block of approximately 40 kb. In addition, we have identified DNaseI-hypersensitive sites within the newly sequenced regions in both mouse and human, and these structural features also are conserved. Finally, we have found that both mouse and human beta-globin loci are embedded within an array of odorant receptor genes that are expressed in olfactory epithelium, and we also identify an olfactory receptor gene located 3' of the beta-globin locus in chicken. The data demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved genomic organization for the beta-globin locus and suggest a possible role for the beta-globin LCR in control of expression of these odorant receptor genes and/or the presence of mechanisms to separate regulatory signals in different tissues.",

The LCR functions over a long distance on chromosome 11 to regulate transcription and replication of the beta-globin genes. To determine whether the HSs function independently or as an integrated unit, we analyzed the requirements for long-range transcriptional activation. If the HSs function independently, individual HSs would be expected to have long-range activity. In contrast, if long-range activity requires multiple HSs, individual HSs would have a limited functional distance. HS2, HS3, and a miniLCR containing multiple HSs, were separated from a gamma-globin promoter by fragments of phage lambda DNA. After stable transfection into K562 cells, HS2 had strong enhancer activity, but only when positioned close to the promoter. HS3 also had strong enhancer activity, although it was weaker than HS2 and more sensitive to the spacer DNA. The miniLCR had the strongest enhancer activity and functioned even at a distance of 7.3 kb. A model is proposed in which synergistic interactions between HSs confer long-range activation by creating a stable LCR nucleoprotein structure, which is competent for recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes. These enzymes would mediate the well-characterized activity of the LCR to modulate chromatin structure.",

A fully active 6.5 kb version of the LCR, called the muLCR, has been described. Expression of the beta-like globin genes is absolutely dependent on the presence of the LCR. The developmental expression pattern of the genes in the cluster is achieved through competition of the promoters for the activating function of the LCR. Transgenic mice experiments suggest that subtle changes in the transcription factor environment lead to the successive silencing of the embryonic epsilon-globin and fetal gamma-globin promoters, resulting in the almost exclusive transcription of the beta-globin gene in adult erythropoiesis. In this paper, we have asked the question whether the LCR and its individual hypersensitive sites 5'HS1-4 can activate a basic promoter in the absence of any other globin sequences. We have employed a minimal promoter derived from the mouse Hsp68 gene driving the bacterial beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene. The results show that the muLCR and 5'HS3 direct erythroid-specific, embryonic expression of this construct, while 5'HS1, 5'HS2 and 5'HS4 are inactive at any stage of development. Expression of the muLCR and 5'HS3 transgenes is repressed during fetal stages of development. The transgenes are in an inactive chromatin conformation and the lacZ gene is not transcribed, as shown by in situ hybridization. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the LCR requires the presence of an active promoter to adopt an open chromatin conformation and with models proposing progressive heterochromatization during embryogenesis. The results suggest that the presence of a beta-globin gene is required for LCR function as conditions become more stringent during development.",

The results show that at least three of the individual DNaseI hypersensitive site regions (sites 1, 2 and 3), though expressing at lower levels than the full DCR, are capable of position independent, copy number dependent expression. Site 2 alone directs the highest level of expression of the single site constructs, producing nearly 70% of the level of the full DCR. Sites 1 and 3 each provide 30% of the full activity. Deletion of either site 2 or 3 from the complete set significantly reduces the level of expression, but does not effect position independence or copy number dependence.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether staged bilateral GKT provides benefit with acceptable risk to patients suffering from disabling medically refractory bilateral tremor. METHODS Eleven patients underwent staged bilateral GKT during a 17-year period (1999-2016). Eight patients had essential tremor (ET), 2 had Parkinson's disease (PD)-related tremor, and 1 had multiple-sclerosis (MS)-related tremor. For the first GKT, a median maximum dose of 140 Gy was delivered to the posterior-inferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) through a single isocenter with 4-mm collimators. Patients who benefitted from unilateral GKT were eligible for a contralateral GKT 1-2 years later (median 22 months). For the second GKT, a median maximum dose of 130 Gy was delivered to the opposite VIM nucleus to a single 4-mm isocenter. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) clinical tremor rating scale was used to score tremor, drawing, and drinking before and after each GKT. The FTM writing score was assessed only for the dominant hand before and after the first GKT. The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was used to assess quality of life and activities of daily living before and after the first and second GKT. RESULTS The median time to last follow-up after the first GKT was 35 months (range 11-70 months). All patients had improvement in at least 1 FTM score after the first GKT. Three patients (27.3%) had tremor arrest and complete restoration of function (noted via FTM tremor, writing, drawing, and drinking scores equaling zero). No patient had tremor recurrence or diminished tremor relief after the first GKT. One patient experienced new temporary neurological deficit (contralateral lower-extremity hemiparesis) from the first GKT. The median time to last follow-up after the second GKT was 12 months (range 2-70 months). Nine patients had improvement in at least 1 FTM score after the second GKT. Two patients had tremor arrest and complete restoration of function. No patient experienced tremor recurrence or diminished tremor relief after the second GKT. No patient experienced new neurological or radiological adverse effect from the second GKT. Statistically significant improvements were noted in the KPS score following the first and second GKT. CONCLUSIONS Staged bilateral GKT provided effective relief for medically refractory, disabling, bilateral tremor without increased risk of neurological complications. It is an appropriate strategy for carefully selected patients with medically refractory bilateral tremor who are not eligible for deep brain stimulation.",

METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the outcomes of 15 patients (mean age 46.5 years) who had undergone GKT over a 15-year period (1998-2012). Fourteen patients underwent GKT at a median maximum dose of 140 Gy (range 130-150 Gy) using a single 4-mm isocenter. One patient underwent GKT at a dose of 140 Gy delivered via two 4-mm isocenters (3 mm apart). The posteroinferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) was the target for all GKTs. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. The median time to the last follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS After GKT, 13 patients experienced tremor improvement on the side contralateral to surgery. Four patients noted tremor arrest at a median of 4.5 months post-GKT. Seven patients had excellent tremor improvement and 6 had good tremor improvement. Four patients noted excellent functional improvement, 8 noted good functional improvement, and 1 noted satisfactory functional improvement. Three patients experienced diminished tremor relief at a median of 18 months after radiosurgery. Two patients experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Another patient developed a large thalamic cyst 60 months after GKT, which was successfully managed with Ommaya reservoir placement.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29157315": " There is a significant need for a targeted therapy for essential tremor (ET), as medications have not been developed specifically for ET, and the ones prescribed are often not well-tolerated, so that many patients remain untreated. Recent work has shown that, unlike previous experience, kinematically guided individualized botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections provide benefit along with minimal weakness. Ours is the first long-term (96-week) safety and efficacy study of BoNT-A as monotherapy for ET using kinematically driven injection parameters. Ten ET patients were administered six serial BoNT-A treatments every 16 weeks and were assessed at 6 weeks following treatment. During each study visit, the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and the Quality of Life for Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) were administered along with kinematic assessment of the treated limb. Participants performed scripted tasks with motion sensors placed over each arm joint. Dosing patterns were determined using the movement disorder neurologist's interpretation of muscles contributing to the kinematically analyzed upper limb tremor biomechanics. There was a 33.8% (p&lt;0.05) functional improvement (FTM part C) and a 39.8% (p&lt;0.0005) improvement in QUEST score at week 96 compared to pretreatment scores at week 0. Although there was a 44.6% (p&lt;0.0005) non-dose-dependent reduction in maximal grip strength, only 2 participants complained of mild weakness. Following the fourth serial treatment, mean action tremor score was reduced by 62.9% (p=0.001) in the treated and by 44.4% (p=0.03) in the untreated arm at week 96 compared to week 48. Individualized BoNT-A dosing patterns to each individual's tremor biomechanics provided an effective monotherapy for ET as function improved without functionally limiting muscle weakness.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293948": "Essential tremor is a neurological syndrome of heterogeneous pathology and aetiology that is characterized by tremor primarily in the upper extremities. This tremor is commonly hypothesized to be driven by a single or multiple neural oscillator(s) within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. Several studies have found an association of blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway with essential tremor, but there is behavioural evidence that also points to the possibility that the severity of tremor could be influenced by visual feedback. Here, we directly manipulated visual feedback during a functional MRI grip force task in patients with essential tremor and control participants, and hypothesized that an increase in visual feedback would exacerbate tremor in the 4-12 Hz range in essential tremor patients. Further, we hypothesized that this exacerbation of tremor would be associated with dysfunctional changes in BOLD signal and entropy within, and beyond, the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. We found that increases in visual feedback increased tremor in the 4-12 Hz range in essential tremor patients, and this increase in tremor was associated with abnormal changes in BOLD amplitude and entropy in regions within the cerebello-thalamo-motor cortical pathway, and extended to visual and parietal areas. To determine if the tremor severity was associated with single or multiple brain region(s), we conducted a birectional stepwise multiple regression analysis, and found that a widespread functional network extending beyond the cerebello-thalamo-motor cortical pathway was associated with changes in tremor severity measured during the imaging protocol. Further, this same network was associated with clinical tremor severity measured with the Fahn, Tolosa, Marin Tremor Rating Scale, suggesting this network is clinically relevant. Since increased visual feedback also reduced force error, this network was evaluated in relation to force error but the model was not significant, indicating it is associated with force tremor but not force error. This study therefore provides new evidence that a widespread functional network is associated with the severity of tremor in patients with essential tremor measured simultaneously at the hand during functional imaging, and is also associated with the clinical severity of tremor. These findings support the idea that the severity of tremor is exacerbated by increased visual feedback, suggesting that designers of new computing technologies should consider using lower visual feedback levels to reduce tremor in essential tremor.",

Five patients with SCA with cortical atrophy (ages 60-69 years; 2 sporadic and three familial SCA) and five patients with essential tremor (ET) (ages 57-71 years) were treated with Vim surgery. Intraoperatively, we recorded neuronal activity from single neurons in the Vim thalamus while patients were at rest and compared the physiological properties of those neurons between patients with SCA and those with ET. Postsurgery mean scores for the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Scale were improved from 78 to 44 in SCA patients and from 54 to 21 in ET patients. Stronger stimulation was necessary to optimize outcomes in SCA as compared to ET patients. We analyzed 68 Vim neurons in SCA and 60 Vim neurons in ET. Mean discharge rates, burst characteristics, and oscillatory activity were similar for both patient groups, however, we observed that the ratio of cells responding to passive manipulation was significantly smaller (<i>P</i> = 0.0001) in SCA (22%) than in ET (71%). Thalamic surgery led to a significant improvement in tremor in SCA patients. One potential mechanism underlying ataxia in SCA may be disruption of cerebellar sensory feedback, which modulates motor commands in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network.",

Although thalamic DBS (ventral intermediate nucleus [Vim] of thalamus) has been shown to reduce tremor in 85-95% of patients, bradykinesia and rigidity often are not well controlled. The dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT) that can directly be targeted with special diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging sequences has been shown as an efficient target for thalamic DBS. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is typically chosen in younger patients as the target for dopamine-responsive motor symptoms. This study investigates a one-path thalamic (Vim/DRT) and subthalamic implantation of DBS electrodes and possibly a combined stimulation strategy for both target regions. This study investigates a one path thalamic (Vim/DRT) and subthalamic implantation of DBS electrodes and a possibly combined stimulation strategy for both target regions. This is a randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded (patient- and observer-blinded), monocentric trial with three treatments, three periods and six treatment sequences allocated according to a Williams design. Eighteen patients will undergo one-path thalamic (Vim/DRT) and STN implantation of DBS electrodes. After one month, a double-blinded and randomly-assigned stimulation of the thalamic target (Vim/DRT), the STN and a combined stimulation of both target regions will be performed for a period of three months each. The primary objective is to assess the quality of life obtained by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (39 items) for each stimulation modality. Secondary objectives include tremor reduction (obtained by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale, video recordings, the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, and by tremor analysis), psychiatric assessment of patients, and to assess the safety of intervention. At the moment, the recruitment is stopped and 12 patients have been randomized and treated. A futility analysis is being carried out by means of a conditional power analysis. The approach of the OPINION trial planned to make, for the first time, a direct comparison of the different stimulation conditions (Vim/DRT, compared to STN, compared to Vim/DRT+STN) in a homogeneous patient population and, furthermore, will allow for intraindividual comparison of each condition with the \"quality of life\" outcome parameter. We hypothesize that the combined stimulation of the STN and the thalamic (Vim/DRT) target will be superior with respect to the patients' quality of life as compared to the singular stimulation of the individual target regions. If this holds true, this work might change the standardized treatment described in the previous section.

In this clinical series the authors present the preliminary results achieved with the world's first tcMRgFUS system integrated with a 1.5-T MRI unit. METHODS The authors describe the results of tcMRgFUS in a sample of patients with ET and with PD who underwent the procedure during the period from January 2015 to September 2017. A monolateral ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) thalamic ablation was performed in both ET and PD patients. In all the tcMRgFUS treatments, a 1.5-T MRI scanner was used for both planning and monitoring the procedure. RESULTS During the study period, a total of 26 patients underwent tcMRgFUS thalamic ablation for different movement disorders. Among these patients, 18 were diagnosed with ET and 4 were affected by PD. All patients with PD were treated using tcMRgFUS thalamic ablation and all completed the procedure. Among the 18 patients with ET, 13 successfully underwent tcMRgFUS, 4 aborted the procedure during ultrasound delivery, and 1 did not undergo the tcMRgFUS procedure after stereotactic frame placement. Two patients with ET were not included in the results because of the short follow-up duration at the time of this study. A monolateral VIM thalamic ablation in both ET and PD patients was performed. All the enrolled patients were evaluated before the treatment and 2 days after, with a clinical control of the treatment effectiveness using the graphic items of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale. A global reevaluation was performed 3 months (17/22 patients) and 6 months (11/22 patients) after the treatment; the reevaluation consisted of clinical questionnaires, neurological tests, and video recordings of the tests. All the ET and PD treated patients who completed the procedure showed an immediate amelioration of tremor severity, with no intra- or posttreatment severe permanent side effects. CONCLUSIONS Although this study reports on a small number of patients with a short follow-up duration, the tcMRgFUS procedure using a 1.5-T MRI unit resulted in a safe and effective treatment option for motor symptoms in patients with ET and PD. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first clinical series in which thalamotomy was performed using tcMRgFUS integrated with a 1.5-T magnet.",

This paper introduces a clinical study to evaluate the feasibility, clinical correlation and reliability of using a system based in smartwatches to quantify tremor in essential tremor (ET) patients and check its acceptance as clinical monitoring tool. The system is based on a commercial smartwatch and an Android smartphone. An investigational Android application controls the process of recording raw data from the smartwatch three-dimensional gyroscopes. Thirty-four ET patients were consecutively enrolled in the experiments and assessed along one year. Arm tremor was videofilmed and scored using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTM-TRS). Tremor intensity was quantified with the root mean square of angular velocity measured in the patients' wrists. Eighty-two assessments with smartwatches were performed. Spearman's correlation coefficients (\u03c1) between clinical tremor (FTM-TRS) scores and smartwatch measures for tremor intensity were 0.590 at rest; \u03c1 = 0.738 in steady posture; \u03c1 = 0.189 in finger-to-nose maneuvers; and \u03c1 = 0.652 in pouring water task. Smartwatch reliability was checked by intraclass realiability coefficients: 0.85, 0.95, 0.91, 0.95 respectively. Most of patients showed good acceptance of the system. This commodity hardware contributes to quantify tremor objectively in a consulting-room by customized Android smart devices as clinical monitoring tool. The NetMD system for tremor analysis is feasible, well-correlated with clinical scores, reliable and well-accepted by patients to tremor follow-up. Therefore, it could be an option to objectively quantify tremor in ET patients during their regular follow-up.",

Participants underwent a deep neurological examination by two blinded to the treatment raters, and a blood sampling to assess plasmatic immunosuppressant level and nephrological function tests. Tremor and cerebellar signs were scored according to the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin and the SARA scale. Parkinsonism was excluded applying the UPDRS (part III). Tremor was more common and severe in the Tacrolimus group, similar to impairment in ADL. Regardless of treatment, tremor involved both upper and lower limbs and was activated by action, but in about 50% of cases presented in action and rest condition. Plasmatic level of Tacrolimus was higher in patients with tremor than in those without, while cholesterol was significantly lower. Cerebellar and neuropathic signs were overall mild and were not significantly different across the three groups comparing patients with and without tremor. Non-Calcineurin inhibitors such as Sirolimus have the lowest propensity to induce tremor and with a milder severity, while Calcineurin inhibitors, especially Tacrolimus, the highest, and regardless of the formulation. Plasmatic concentration of Tacrolimus was higher in tremulous patients; further research needs to validate the role of cholesterol plasmatic concentration in predicting the occurrence of tremor in patients on Tacrolimus.",

We recruited 8 patients with essential tremor in a stable postoperative condition (&gt;3 months after electrode implantation of deep brain stimulation [DBS] electrodes) with segmented contacts implanted in the VIM. Tremor severity on acute stimulation was assessed by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale. Cerebellar impairment was evaluated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. Patients rated paresthesia intensity with a visual analog scale. In all patients, tremor was reduced to the same extent by VIM stimulation regardless of pulse width using energy dose-equivalent amplitudes. Short pulse stimulation diminished stimulation-induced ataxia of the upper extremities and paresthesia compared with conventional parameters. Directional steering with monopolar stimulation of single segments successfully suppressed tremor but also induced ataxia. No differences in adverse effects were found between single-segment stimulation conditions. These proof-of-principle findings provide evidence that acute short pulse stimulation is superior to directional steering in the subthalamic area to decrease stimulation-induced side effects while preserving tremor suppression effects in patients with tremor. This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with tremor with thalamic DBS, acute short pulse stimulation reduces adverse effects, while directional steering does not provide a generalizable benefit regarding adverse effects.",

The median follow-up period after surgery was 27 months (range 10-75 months). The preoperative mean Fahn-Tolosa-Marin action tremor score was 3.3 +/- 0.5, and the postoperative mean score with the DBS system activated was 0.8 +/- 0.4. The mean preoperative writing score was 2.8 +/- 0.9, and the postoperative mean writing score with the DBS system activated was 1 +/- 0.6. (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p &lt; 0.005). Fourteen patients were treated with bipolar stimulation, and four eventually required monopolar stimulation. Complications included lead breakage (one patient); temporary erythema of the incision through which the pulse generator had been implanted, which required oral antibiotics (one patient); electrode migration, which required surgery (one patient); and mild hand tingling during stimulation (three patients). Twelve of 18 patients with implanted systems experienced no morbid condition. Thalamic DBS is safe and effective for medically refractory ET. Stimulator adjustments can frequently occur in some patients, and tremor may worsen despite a readjustment in the system.",

Before and after surgery, PD patients were evaluated using the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), and ET patients were evaluated using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) tremor rating scale. Inner and total lesion volumes were determined with postoperative MR imaging and three-dimensional data segmentation. Lesion volumes were compared to percent improvement in UPDRS and FTM scores, using Spearman's rank-order correlation test. No rank-order correlations were found between lesion volume and clinical improvement in either the PD or the ET patients. In performing stereotactic surgery for movement disorders, any lesion volume within a prescribed range may be equally effective in relieving symptoms associated with PD or ET.",

Besides, the patients self-administered EQ-5D, Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2), and Beck Depression Inventories. Branded and generic ropinirole treatment achieved similar scores on all tests measuring severity of motor symptoms (primary endpoint, UPDRS-III: 27.0 versus 28.0 points, P = 0.505). Based on patient diaries, the lengths of \"good time periods\" were comparable (10.5 and 10.0 hours for branded and generic ropinirole, resp., P = 0.670). However, generic ropinirole therapy achieved almost 3.0 hours shorter on time without dyskinesia (6.5 versus. 9.5 hours, P &lt; 0.05) and 2.5 hours longer on time with slight dyskinesia (3.5 versus. 1.0 hours, P &lt; 0.05) than the branded ropinirole did.

We studied a cohort of 125 consecutive patients treated with valproate due to epilepsy or migraine, evaluated with the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTM-TRS). A total of 14 (11.2%) patients had rest tremor (bilateral n = 10, unilateral n = 4). Patients with rest tremor had significant higher scores in the FTM-TRS (P &lt; 0.001), but only one was diagnosed with parkinsonism. Patients may have valproate-induced parkinsonism or exacerbated motor features of Parkinson's disease by valproate. The frequency of parkinsonism was 1.6% in this cohort and of 3% in the pooled data of 717 patients from previous reports. Rest tremor is observed in 11.2% of patients treated with valproate and is related to the burden of valproate-induced tremor, rather than the presence of parkinsonism.",

By virtue of recent studies of nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) that are used to characterize Parkinson's disease (PD), these symptoms have also been added to the definition of ET. There is increasing evidence to suggest that ET might not be as benign and monosymptomatic as we previously thought. The aim of this study was to evaluate nonmotor symptoms in ET, and to compare them with PD. We studied 37 ET and 23 PD patients. Tremor rate was evaluated using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (FTM-TRS) in ET patients. The patients with PD were scored for motor symptoms using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS)-III and the Hoehn-Yahr scale. Cognitive functions were assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. NMSs were evaluated with the nonmotor symptoms questionnaire (NMSQuest). In the ET group, the most common NMSs were forgetting things, feeling sad, nocturia, urgency, and difficulty concentrating. The mean NMSQuest score was 8.43 \u00b1 4.14 in the ET group and 14.06 \u00b1 5.44 in the PD group (p value &lt;0.001). However, except for 12 items in NMSQuest, in comparing items one by one there was no statistical difference between them. The mean MoCA total score was 17.81 \u00b1 4.56 in the ET group and 17.08 \u00b1 4.08 in the PD group (p value 0.675). There were no significant differences in MoCA subgroup scores.

The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between proximal and distal muscle strength and upper limb functionality and tremor severity in patients with essential tremor (ET). The study enrolled 25 tremor patients followed at the neurology clinic of a university hospital and 19 healthy controls. Demographic data, risk factors, disease duration and dominant hand of the participants were recorded. Back and leg strength was assessed using a back and leg dynamometer and hand dynamometer and pinchmeter were used to determine hand strength. Functional ability of the participants was evaluated using the Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT), Perdue Pegboard (PPBT) and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). Tremor severity was assessed using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS) and the Lower Extremity Clinical Tremor Assessment Scale (LECTAS). A significant difference was found in the average back and leg muscle strength between ET patients and healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05). The mean values for right/left hand muscle strength were not significantly different between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Among the upper limb functional ability tests, significant differences were found between the two groups in the mean time to complete NHPT, Minnesota placing subtest and PPBT test (p &lt; 0.05). While gender and risk factors were not significantly different between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05), there was a significant difference with respect to the educational level (p &lt; 0.01). No significant difference was found between back and leg muscle strength and FTMTRS and LECTAS (p &gt; 0.05). A negative correlation and a significant association were found between average strength measurements obtained with the left hand dynamometer and FTMTRS in the ET group (p = 0.030, r = - 0.434). A positive correlation and a significant association were found between left hand strength and mean turning time in the MMDT in the control group (p = 0.041, r = 0.473).

The goal of this study was to examine nonmotor features in young patients with ET and their impact on quality of life. 45 patients (24.55 \u00b1 7.16 years old) with ET and 35 controls were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Short Form-36. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Turkish version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Battery (MoCA). We ruled out other possible causes of the tremor. The tremor rate was evaluated using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale. Poor sleep quality, fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were more common, and MoCA total scores were lower in the patient group. Fatigue, depressive symptoms, and higher anxiety levels were seen to have a negative effect on physical and mental health. Excessive daytime sleepiness had a negative effect on physical health. There is an emerging interest in nonmotor features of ET. This study showed that even young patients have nonmotor features that decrease their quality of life.

In this study, we evaluated DN functional connectivity (FC) changes and their relationship with motor and non-motor symptoms in ET. We studied 25 ET patients and 26 healthy controls. Tremor severity was assessed using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (FTM-TRS) and tremor amplitude and frequency were evaluated using kinematic techniques. Cognitive profile was assessed by montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and frontal assessment battery (FAB). All participants underwent a 3 T MRI protocol including resting-state blood oxygenation level dependent and diffusion tensor sequences. We used a seed-based approach to investigate DN FC and to explore the diffusion properties of cerebellar peduncles. There was significantly decreased DN FC with cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar areas in ET patients compared with healthy controls. Correlation analysis showed that: (1) the DN FC with the supplementary motor area, pre and postcentral gyri, and prefrontal cortex negatively correlated with FTM-TRS score and disease duration; (2) DN FC changes in the thalamus and caudate negatively correlated with peak tremor frequency, changes in the cerebellum positively correlated with tremor amplitude, and changes in the bilateral thalamus negatively correlated with tremor amplitude, and (3) DN FC with the associative prefrontal and parietal cortices, basal ganglia, and thalamus positively correlated with the MoCA score.

We studied mirtazapine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 17 ET patients. Patients were started with 15 mg per day of either mirtazapine or placebo for 1 week and the dose was escalated weekly until the targeted dose of 45 mg per day was achieved. This dose was maintained for 2 weeks. Tremor was assessed at baseline and after 14 days of 45 mg of mirtazapine or placebo. There was a minimum washout period of 14 days between the two arms of the study. Tremor assessments included global improvement, Fahn Tolosa Marin Tremor Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39. Patient global improvement ratings indicated that in the placebo condition 12 patients were unchanged and 1 patient was mildly improved. In the mirtazapine condition, 10 patients were unchanged, 2 were moderately improved and 1 was markedly improved. There was no significant improvement with mirtazapine or placebo compared to baseline as measured by the Tremor Rating Scale. Adverse effects were more common in the mirtazapine group and included drowsiness, confusion, dry mouth, weight gain, polyuria, itching, nausea, gait and balance problems, blurred vision, and bad taste. We conclude that the majority of the ET patients do not benefit from mirtazapine. Mirtazapine has significant adverse effects and should be used cautiously in ET patients.",

Therefore, we explored brain connectivity based on slow spontaneous fluctuations of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in patients with essential tremor (ET). A cohort of 19 ET patients and 23 healthy individuals were scanned in resting condition using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). <i>General connectivity</i> was assessed by eigenvector centrality (EC) mapping. <i>Selective connectivity</i> was analyzed by correlations of the BOLD signal between the preselected seed regions and all the other brain areas. These measures were then correlated with the tremor severity evaluated by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTS). Compared to healthy subjects, ET patients were found to have lower EC in the cerebellar hemispheres and higher EC in the anterior cingulate and in the primary motor cortices bilaterally. In patients, the FTMTS score correlated positively with the EC in the putamen. In addition, the FTMTS score correlated positively with selective connectivity between the thalamus and other structures (putamen, pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), parietal cortex), and between the pre-SMA and the putamen. We observed a selective coupling between a number of areas in the sensorimotor network including the basal ganglia and the ventral intermediate nucleus of thalamus, which is widely used as neurosurgical target for tremor treatment. Finally, ET was marked by suppression of general connectivity in the cerebellum, which is in agreement with the concept of ET as a disorder with cerebellar damage.",

The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) is a validated clinical scale designed specifically for the assessment of ET severity. TETRAS has anchors that span a larger range of tremor amplitudes (&gt;20 cm = grade 4), making it more suitable for assessing patients with severe ET. However, there is no direct comparison of these scales in any clinical trial. Upper limb postural and kinetic tremor items from both scales were compared using blinded, video-recorded examinations of patients with moderate-to-severe ET who participated in a trial of focused ultrasound thalamotomy. FTM ratings of postural and kinetic tremor correlated strongly with those of TETRAS. However, FTM exhibited a ceiling effect for severe tremor. Rest tremor, exclusive to FTM, correlated poorly with postural and kinetic tremor and had very poor test-retest reliability. In contrast, wing-beating postural tremor, exclusive to TETRAS, exhibited excellent test-retest reliability and a strong correlation with kinetic and limbs-extended-forward postural tremor. Test-retest reliabilities of the other TETRAS and FTM ratings were excellent, and both scales had good sensitivity to treatment effect. TETRAS has 2 main advantages over FTM in the assessment of tremor severity: (1) the absence of a ceiling effect in patients with severe ET, and (2) the inclusion of wing-beating tremor.",

Proper treatment of ET is contingent upon correct assessment of the severity, loss of function, and disability related to tremor. Videotape recordings of 17 subjects with ET evaluated with the TRS were produced and sent to 59 raters. Once the raters returned the videotape and completed the score sheet, they were mailed a second tape with the same recordings presented in a different order. In the interrater reliability evaluation, modified Kappa statistics for seven tremor type composites ranged from 0.10 to 0.65 in the first videotape and 0.17 to 0.62 in the second videotape. Interrater reliabilities were greater for Part A items (magnitude of tremor in different body parts) than for Part B items (tremor in writing and drawings) of the TRS. The average Spearman correlation was 0.87, indicating very good consistency between the two videotapes, but correlations for Part A were somewhat better than for Part B. It is best when the same rater performs repeated measures of tremor on a patient, particularly when judging tremor in handwriting and drawings.

It exists as two splicing variants, SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b, which differ in 9 out of 206 amino acids. SNAP-25 together with Syntaxin 1 and VAMP-2 forms the ternary SNARE complex essential for mediating activity-dependent release of hormones and neurotransmitters. The functional difference between SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b is poorly understood as both can participate in SNARE complexes and mediate membrane fusion. However, we recently demonstrated that SNAP-25b-deficiency results in metabolic disease and increased insulin secretion. Here we investigated if SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b differently affect interactions with other SNAREs and SNARE-interacting proteins in mouse hippocampus. Adult mice almost exclusively express the SNAP-25b protein in hippocampus whereas SNAP-25b-deficient mice only express SNAP-25a. Immunoprecipitation studies showed no significant differences in amount of Syntaxin 1 and VAMP-2 co-precipitated with the different SNAP-25 isoforms. In contrast, Munc18-1, that preferentially interacts with SNAP-25 via Syntaxin 1 and/or the trimeric SNARE complex, demonstrated an increased ability to bind protein-complexes containing SNAP-25b. Moreover, we found that both SNAP-25 isoforms co-precipitated the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins, an interaction known to play a role in presynaptic inhibition. We have identified G\u03b2<sub>1</sub> and G\u03b2<sub>2</sub> as the interacting partners of both SNAP-25 isoforms in mouse hippocampus, but G\u03b2<sub>2</sub> was less efficiently captured by SNAP-25a.

We modified previously developed methods to propose a faster, simpler and more economical method, which includes centrifugation and hemolysis. Specifically, our method comprises two-stage centrifugation with gravitational acceleration (g) at 600g and 3000g, followed by the addition of a lysis buffer and another 3000g centrifugation. In total, 324 monomicrobial bacterial cultures were identified. The success rate of species identification was 81.8%, which is comparable with other complex methods. The identification success rate was the highest for Gram-negative aerobes (85%), followed by Gram-positive aerobes (78.2%) and anaerobes (67%).

Disruption of the transcriptional program alters the cellular state and may predispose cells to the acquisition of genetic abnormalities. Early studies have shown that proteins that promote cell differentiation often serve as tumor suppressors, whereas inhibitors of those proteins act as oncogenes in the context of acute leukemia. A prime example is T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of immature stage thymocytes. Although a relatively small number of genetic abnormalities are observed in T-ALL, these abnormalities are crucial for leukemogenesis. Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors in T-ALL are transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis. The transformation process in T-ALL is efficient and orchestrated; the oncogene disrupts the transcriptional program directing T-cell differentiation and also uses its native ability as a master transcription factor in hematopoiesis. This imbalance in the transcriptional program is a primary determinant underlying the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL.

MicroRNA-7 has been shown to play a critical role in proliferation, migration, and treatment sensitivity in a diverse array of cancers. In this study, we sought to establish a novel link between microRNA-7 and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. To do so, we characterized gene expression of microRNA-7 as well as <i>TAL1</i> in both T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived tissue and cell lines, as well as performing functional luciferase assays to assess microRNA-7 binding to the <i>TAL1</i> 3'-untranslated region. We also performed growth, apoptosis, and migration experiments using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Annexin V, and transwell assays in the context of microRNA-7 overexpression. We found that microRNA-7 expression is attenuated and inversely correlated with <i>TAL1</i> expression in TAL1 + T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Additionally, microRNA-7 directly targets and suppresses TAL1 levels. Finally, microRNA-7 overexpression reduces growth, motility, and migration while inducing apoptosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, phenotypes that can be rescued by concomitant overexpression of TAL1. These results indicate that microRNA-7 functions as a potent tumor suppressor by inhibiting the oncogene TAL1 and suggest microRNA-7 could function as a prognostic biomarker and possible therapeutic in the clinical management of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

Transcriptional activation of these oncogenes in leukemic cells typically results from chromosomal rearrangements that place them next to highly active cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements. However, biallelic activation of TAL1 in some T-ALL cases has been previously proposed. We have used allele-specific mRNA analysis to show that trans-acting mechanisms leading to biallelic overexpression of TAL1 are involved in 10 (42%) of 24 TAL1+ informative T-ALL cases, 2 (17%) of 12 HOX11+ informative cases, and 7 (64%) of 11 LMO2+ informative cases. We propose that aberrant expression of oncogenic transcription factors in a significant fraction of T-ALLs may result from loss of the upstream transcriptional mechanisms that normally down-regulate the expression of these oncogenes during T-cell development.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28028313": "The transcription factor TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder resulting from leukemic transformation of thymus T-cell precursors. TAL1 is normally expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) but is silenced in immature thymocytes. We hypothesize that TAL1 contributes to leukemogenesis by activating genes that are normally repressed in immature thymocytes. Herein, we identified a novel TAL1-regulated super-enhancer controlling the GIMAP locus, which resides within an insulated chromosomal locus in T-ALL cells. The GIMAP genes are expressed in HSCs and mature T cells but are downregulated during the immature stage of thymocyte differentiation. The GIMAP enhancer is activated by TAL1, RUNX1 and GATA3 in human T-ALL cells but is repressed by E-proteins. Overexpression of human GIMAP genes in immature thymocytes alone does not induce tumorigenesis but accelerates leukemia development in zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that aberrant activation of the GIMAP enhancer contributes to T-cell leukemogenesis.",

Here we identify the core transcriptional regulatory circuit controlled by TAL1 and its regulatory partners HEB, E2A, LMO1/2, GATA3, and RUNX1. We show that TAL1 forms a positive interconnected autoregulatory loop with GATA3 and RUNX1 and that the TAL1 complex directly activates the MYB oncogene, forming a positive feed-forward regulatory loop that reinforces and stabilizes the TAL1-regulated oncogenic program. One of the critical downstream targets in this circuitry is the TRIB2 gene, which is oppositely regulated by TAL1 and E2A/HEB and is essential for the survival of T-ALL cells.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9507011": "The Tal1 oncogene is a class II basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, overexpressed in as much as 60% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Like other class II bHLH proteins, Tal1 can heterodimerize with the class I bHLH proteins, such as E47, and bind to a DNA recognition sequence termed E box. Therefore, it is believed that the oncogenic capacity of Tal1 lies in its ability, as a heterodimer with E47, to activate aberrantly a set of \"leukemogenic\" genes in T cells. However, compared with E47 homodimers, Tal1/E47 heterodimers are very poor transactivators. Thus the effect of Tal1 is actually to inhibit E47 homodimer activity. Here we propose that the transforming properties of Tal1 are the result of its ability to inhibit E47 activity. We address the mechanism of Tal1 inhibition and demonstrate that Tal1/E47 heterodimers cannot activate transcription because their respective activation domains are incompatible. Furthermore, we present data showing that Tal1 can inhibit E47-mediated activation of the CIP1 gene. Finally, we demonstrate that Tal1 inhibits E47 activity in leukemic T cells.",

It is required for specification of the blood program during development, adult hematopoietic stem cell survival and quiescence, and terminal maturation of select blood lineages. Following ectopic expression, SCL contributes to oncogenesis in T-ALL. Remarkably, SCL's activities are all mediated through nucleation of a core quaternary protein complex (SCL:E-protein:LMO1/2 [LIM domain only 1 or 2]:LDB1 [LIM domain-binding protein 1]) and dynamic recruitment of conserved combinatorial associations of additional regulators in a lineage- and stage-specific context. The finely tuned control of SCL's regulatory functions (lineage priming, activation, and repression of gene expression programs) provides insight into fundamental developmental and transcriptional mechanisms, and highlights mechanistic parallels between normal and oncogenic processes. Importantly, recent discoveries are paving the way to the development of innovative therapeutic opportunities in SCL<sup>+</sup> T-ALL.",

Here, we confirmed that miR-146b-5p expression is lower in TAL1-positive patient samples than in other T-ALL cases. Furthermore, leukemia T-cells display decreased levels of miR-146b-5p as compared to normal T-cells, thymocytes and other hematopoietic progenitors. MiR-146b-5p silencing enhances the in vitro migration and invasion of T-ALL cells, associated with increased levels of filamentous actin and chemokinesis. In vivo, miR-146b overexpression in a TAL1-positive cell line extends mouse survival in a xenotransplant model of human T-ALL. In contrast, knockdown of miR-146b-5p results in leukemia acceleration and decreased mouse overall survival, paralleled by faster tumor infiltration of the central nervous system. Our results suggest that miR-146b-5p is a functionally relevant microRNA gene in the context of T-ALL, whose negative regulation by TAL1 and possibly other oncogenes contributes to disease progression by modulating leukemia cell motility and disease aggressiveness.",

The misexpression of TAL1 in immature thymocytes leads to a widespread series of orchestrated downstream events that affect several different cellular machineries, resulting in a lethal consequence, namely T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

Although all vaccines are required by health authorities to contain 15 micrograms haemagglutinin per dose of each virus strain, there were significant differences in haemagglutination titres among the examined vaccines of both types. The enzymatic activity of neuraminidase was present in all vaccines except Fluvirin. Total protein content was lower for subunit vaccines. Viral nucleoprotein was detected in all split vaccines but to varying levels according to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. The ovalbumin content was low in general but was about tenfold higher for Influvac than for the other vaccines analysed. This protein may induce hypersensitive reactions among persons with severe egg allergy. All three split-virion vaccines were found to contain the matrix protein; however, it was not detected in the subunit vaccines. Differences in influenza antigen variety in currently available vaccines may affect efficacy, whereas differences in concentrations of nonviral compounds such as ovalbumin and endotoxin may lead to different postvaccination reactogenicity profiles.",

However, there is an ongoing search for novel checkpoints with targeting innate immunity via activation of macrophage phagocytosis representing an exciting therapeutic strategy. CD47 is the dominant negative macrophage immune checkpoint expressed on cancer cells which acts as a \"don't eat me signal\", preventing phagocytosis via its interaction with SIRP-\u03b1 on macrophages. CD47 has been shown to be upregulated in many cancer types including myeloid malignancies with increased expression associated with inferior OS. Magrolimab, an anti-CD47 antibody, has shown proof-of-principle of efficacy in this therapeutic class with promising early results in both higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and TP53 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The toxicity profile to date has been shown safe and manageable with on-target anemia related to CD47 being present on aged red blood cells and without evidence of immune related toxicities. Investigation of novel agents targeting this pathway and novel combinations are ongoing.

However, the methods currently used for evaluating the editing efficiency still suffer from many limitations, including preferential detection of some mutation types, sensitivity to polymorphisms that hamper mismatch detection, lack of multiplex capability, or sensitivity to assay conditions. Here, we describe qEva-CRISPR, a new quantitative method that overcomes these limitations and allows simultaneous (multiplex) analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-induced modifications in a target and the corresponding off-targets or in several different targets. We demonstrate all of the advantages of the qEva-CRISPR method using a number of sgRNAs targeting the TP53, VEGFA, CCR5, EMX1 and HTT genes in different cell lines and under different experimental conditions. Unlike other methods, qEva-CRISPR detects all types of mutations, including point mutations and large deletions, and its sensitivity does not depend on the mutation type. Moreover, this approach allows for successful analysis of targets located in 'difficult' genomic regions.

Screening of a natural compound library identified the antibiotic Tetrocarcin-A as a novel downregulator of JAM-A and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) protein expression in breast cancer cells. Lysosomal inhibition partially rescued the downregulation of JAM-A and HER2 caused by Tetrocarcin-A, and attenuated its cytotoxic activity. Tetrocarcin-A treatment or JAM-A silencing reduced AKT and ERK phosphorylation, inhibited c-FOS phosphorylation at Threonine-232 (its transcriptional regulation site), inhibited nuclear localization of c-FOS, and downregulated expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP). This was accompanied by Tetrocarcin-A-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. To begin evaluating the potential clinical relevance of our findings, we extended our studies to other models. Encouragingly, Tetrocarcin-A downregulated JAM-A expression and caused cytotoxicity in primary breast cells and lung cancer stem cells, and inhibited the growth of xenografts in a semi-in vivo model involving invasion across the chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane. Taken together, our data suggest that Tetrocarcin-A warrants future evaluation as a novel cancer therapeutic by virtue of its ability to downregulate JAM-A expression, reduce tumorigenic signaling and induce apoptosis.",

Trastuzumab has significantly increased clinical benefit in HER2+ metastatic and adjuvant settings; however, it is not effective for many patients due to primary or acquired resistance to the drug. During the last decade, many studies have revealed a number of novel molecular traits of HER2+ breast cancer, allowing us to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in trastuzumab resistance and develop strategies to overcome resistance to therapy. In this review, we comprehensively addressed the current achievements in preclinical studies; we discussed molecular mechanisms of acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer models and potential therapeutic approaches based on the molecular features for HER2+ breast cancer.

Prior to intravenous infusion, Herceptin must be reconstituted with sterile water for injection and then diluted in intravenous bags with normal saline. The objective of this study was to test the in-use physicochemical stability of the Herceptin drug product after dilution in 0.9% sodium chloride in commercial polyvinylchloride, and polyolefin/ polyethylene/polypropylene infusion bags over the course of a 7-day storage at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C followed by 24 hours of storage at 30\u00b0C with ambient light exposure.

Samples for analysis were obtained immediately after dilution of the reconstituted solution (T0), after 7 days of storage at 5\u00b0C (T7), after 1 further day of storage at 30\u00b0C (T7+1), and after administration through intravenous tubing (Tend). Control samples were obtained from bags containing only 0.9% sodium chloride at each time point. For experiments with both infusion bags, all samples were practically free from particles, were colorless, and had low numbers of subvisible particles with no differences between control and experimental samples. No change in turbidity was detected between T0 and Tend for low and high-concentration samples for each batch. The pH values remained consistent between T0 and T7+1, and osmolality values were consistent across low-concentration and high-concentration samples. Protein content, size, and potency remained consistent throughout storage and simulated infusion. In conclusion, Herceptin remains physicochemically stable for 7 days when stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, followed by an additional 24 hours at 30\u00b0C when diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride and stored in commercially available polyvinylchloride or polyolefin/polyethylene/polypropylene infusion bags.",

Interestingly, it has been observed that genetic variants in these receptors may alter the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. Polymorphic variants in members of the EGFR family could influence different biologic activities, such as ligands affinity, dimerization efficiency, kinase activity, expression levels, with a consequent impact in signalling pathways and cell behaviour. This study aimed to verify whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EGFR family members could represent susceptibility factors able to influence the risk to develop CRC. Peripheral blood of 70 Italian colon cancer patients and 72 healthy controls was used as a source of genomic DNA to investigate EGFR, HER2 and HER3 common non-synonymous SNPs. Genetic association tests were performed to verify a possible relationship with CRC. Evidence of genotype association was found for the R521K EGFR polymorphism under a dominant mode of inheritance (Mid-P=0.031).

Of this family, HER2 does not bind growth factors and HER3 does not encode an active tyrosine kinase. This diversity creates difficulty in creating pan-specific therapeutic HER family inhibitors. We have identified single amino acid changes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER3 which create high affinity sequestration of the cognate ligands, and may be used as receptor decoys to downregulate aberrant HER family activity. In silico modeling and high throughput mutagenesis were utilized to identify receptor mutants with very high ligand binding activity. A single mutation (T15S; EGFR subdomain I) enhanced affinity for EGF (two-fold), TGF-alpha (twenty-six-fold), and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF (six-fold). This indicates that T15 is an important, previously undescribed, negative regulatory amino acid for EGFR ligand binding. Another mutation (Y246A; HER 3 subdomain II) enhanced neuregulin (NRG)1-beta binding eight-fold, probably by interfering with subdomain II-IV interactions. Further work revealed that the HER3 subunit of an EGFR:HER3 heterodimer suppresses EGFR ligand binding. Optimization required reversing this suppression by mutation of the EGFR tether domain (G564A; subdomain IV). This mutation resulted in enhanced ligand binding (EGF, ten-fold; TGF-alpha, thirty-four-fold; HB-EGF, seventeen-fold; NRG1-beta, thirty-one-fold). This increased ligand binding was reflected in improved inhibition of in vitro tumor cell proliferation and tumor suppression in a human non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model.

In contrast, the role of the HER and EGF families in malignant lymphoma has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the HER and EGF families in lymphoma cell lines and tumor samples. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the ligands for HER1 were mainly expressed in gastric cancer and colon cancer cell lines, but not in lymphoma cell lines. On the other hand, the EGF family member, neuregulin (NRG) 4, was highly expressed in lymphoma cell lines. Immunohistochemical analyses of malignant lymphoma clinical samples revealed that NRG4 and HER4 were mainly expressed in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and follicular lymphoma. Immunoprecipitation of Raji and Daudi cell lines revealed that recombinant NRG4 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4. Additionally, recombinant NRG4 activated the proliferation of lymphoma cell lines.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody to HER-2, is specifically approved for HER-2-positive breast cancer but is active only in a subset of these tumors. Blocking HER-2 function by a small molecule kinase inhibitor, therefore, represents an attractive alternate strategy to inhibit the growth of HER-2-positive tumors. HKI-272 is a potent inhibitor of HER-2 and is highly active against HER-2-overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. It also inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase and the proliferation of EGFR-dependent cells. HKI-272 reduces HER-2 receptor autophosphorylation in cells at doses consistent with inhibition of cell proliferation and functions as an irreversible binding inhibitor, most likely by targeting a cysteine residue in the ATP-binding pocket of the receptor. In agreement with the predicted effects of HER-2 inactivation, HKI-272 treatment of cells results in inhibition of downstream signal transduction events and cell cycle regulatory pathways. This leads to arrest at the G(1)-S (Gap 1/DNA synthesis)-phase transition of the cell division cycle, ultimately resulting in decreased cell proliferation. In vivo, HKI-272 is active in HER-2- and EGFR-dependent tumor xenograft models when dosed orally on a once daily schedule.

These results caused an immediate wave of demand for Herceptin in adjuvant therapy. Results of these studies are critically reviewed. Furthermore, the available preliminary results from studies using Herceptin in the primary (neoadjuvant) therapy of HER-2-positive breast cancer are addressed and possible implications for HER-2 testing are discussed.",

Present study revealed that HER-2 mutant K753E showed some contrasting behaviour as compared to wild, L768S and V773L HER-2 in complex with lapatinib while similar to previously known lapatinib resistant L755S HER-2 mutant. Lapatinib showed stable but reverse orientation in binding site of K753E and the highest binding energy among studied HER2-lapatinib complexes but slightly lesser than L755S mutant. Results indicate that K753E has similar profile as L755S mutant for lapatinib.

Concerned about the ethnic differences on the expression of this oncogene, we have evaluated 143 consecutive specimens of primary breast cancer diagnosed in San Pablo Hospital, Puerto Rico. The specimens were analyzed for Her-2/neu expression using immunohistochemistry assays (Hercept test). We have related the expression of hormone receptor status, percent cells in S phase, DNA ploidy, tumor size, nodal status and menopausal state with the Her2/neu expression. Out of 143 specimens, 28 overexpressed the Her-2/neu (19.6%). Of the Her/2 negative 30/114 (26%) were estrogen receptor negative as compared to 9/27 (33%) (p = 0.464). The degree of aneuploidy was abnormal in 25/104 (24%) in the Her-2/neu negative vs 11/27 (41%) p = 0.083. The percent cell in DNA synthesis was high in 16/77 (21%) in Her-2/neu negative vs 4/15 (27%) p = 0.613.

However, little is known about the benefit of HER2-targeted therapy for NSCLCs harboring HER2 alterations. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of afatinib, an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-HER2 dual inhibitor, in lung cancers harboring HER2 oncogene alterations, including novel HER2 mutations in the transmembrane domain, which we recently identified. Normal bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, ectopically overexpressing wild-type HER2 or mutants (A775insYVMA, G776VC, G776LC, P780insGSP, V659E, and G660D) showed constitutive autophosphorylation of HER2 and activation of downstream signaling. They were sensitive to afatinib, but insensitive to gefitinib. Furthermore, we examined the antitumor activity of afatinib and gefitinib in several NSCLC cell lines, and investigated the association between their genetic alterations and sensitivity to afatinib treatment. In HER2-altered NSCLC cells (H2170, Calu-3, and H1781), afatinib downregulated the phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR as well as their downstream signaling, and induced an antiproliferative effect through G1 arrest and apoptotic cell death. In contrast, HER2- or EGFR-non-dependent NSCLC cells were insensitive to afatinib. In addition, these effects were confirmed in vivo by using a xenograft mouse model of HER2-altered lung cancer cells. Our results suggest that afatinib is a therapeutic option as a HER2-targeted therapy for NSCLC harboring HER2 amplification or mutations.",

However, the detailed mechanism of how the HER2 L755P mutation causes drug resistance to lapatinib remains elusive. Here, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations [molecular mechanics and generalized Born/surface area (MM-GBSA)] were performed to reveal the mechanism of drug resistance due to the HER2 L755P mutation. MD simulations revealed that the L755P mutation caused structural changes in the regions of helix \u03b1C, the glycine-rich loop, and the activation loop, thereby leading to the loss of interactions between the solubilizing group of lapatinib and HER2. Moreover, MM-GBSA calculations suggested that hydrophobic interactions between lapatinib and HER2 contribute most to the binding affinity, and that the L755P mutation could result in a less energetically favorable HER2/lapatinib complex. This may weaken the binding of lapatinib to the mutated HER2, thereby leading to the emergence of drug resistance.

HER2 acts as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding. HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity may reduce oncogenicity.

The quality attributes of Etanercept BS were similar to those of Enbrel, and the binding affinities to TNF\u03b1/LT\u03b1, TNF\u03b1 neutralizing activity, nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicological profiles of Etanercept BS were comparable to Enbrel. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of Etanercept BS were equivalent to those of Enbrel and there was no clinically significant difference in safety profiles between them in Phase I and Phase III clinical studies. The marketing approval application of the Etanercept BS with the same indications as Enbrel filed by Mochida Pharmaceutical was approved in January 2018 and the products will be launched by Ayumi Pharmaceutical in the near future. The Etanercept BS, which is as highly effective as Enbrel is expected to make beneficial therapies more easily accessible to patients.",

A phase III trail and the JESMR study, both performed in Japan, implicated the importance of concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Further evidences, including the TEAR study and the PRESERVE study, supported the recent treatment strategy for RA, being divided into at least two phases: remission induction phase(step-up or initial combination) and its maintenance phase (step-down). Thus, optimization of RA treatment chiefly based on MTX and anti-TNF biological agents is in progress.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that infarction volumes caused by transient cerebral ischemia were greater in diabetic rats than in nondiabetic rats. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a proinflammatory protein produced in the brain in response to cerebral ischemia that promotes apoptosis. Etanercept (ETN), a recombinant TNF receptor (p75)-Fc fusion protein, competitively inhibits TNF-\u03b1. Therefore, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of chronic or acute treatment with ETN on cerebral injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/Re) in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of ETN against the apoptosis and myeloperoxidase activity. Single administration of ETN before MCAO significantly suppressed exacerbation of cerebral damage in nondiabetic rats, as assessed by infarct volume. In contrast, the diabetic state markedly aggravated MCAO/Re-induced cerebral damage despite ETN treatment within 24 h before MCAO. However, the damage was improved by repeated administration of ETN at 900 \u03bcg/kg/daily in rats in an induced diabetic state. These results suggested that repeated administration of ETN can prevent exacerbation of cerebral ischemic injury in the diabetic state and is mainly attributed to anti-inflammatory effects.",

ETN is synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology as a fusion protein, with a fully human TNFRII ectodomain linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Successful manufacture of biologics, such as ETN, requires sophisticated process and product understanding, as well as meticulous control of operations to maintain product consistency. The objective of this evaluation was to show that the product profile of ETN drug substance (DS) has been consistent over the course of production. Multiple orthogonal biochemical analyses, which included evaluation of attributes indicative of product purity, potency, and quality, were assessed on &gt;2,000 batches of ETN from three sites of DS manufacture, during the period 1998-2015. Based on the key quality attributes of product purity (assessed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography HPLC), binding activity (to TNF by ELISA), potency (inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis by cell-based bioassay) and quality (N-linked oligosaccharide map), we show that the integrity of ETN DS has remained consistent over time. This consistency was maintained through three major enhancements to the initial process of manufacturing that were supported by detailed comparability assessments, and approved by the European Medicines Agency. Examination of results for all major quality attributes for ETN DS indicates a highly consistent process for over 18 years and throughout changes to the manufacturing process, without affecting safety and efficacy, as demonstrated across a wide range of clinical trials of ETN in multiple inflammatory diseases.",

Interleukin-6 inhibitors (IL-6i) block the production of acute-phase reactants (APRs), which are some of the composite measures of disease activity. We undertook this study to examine the agreement between the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein level, the Simplified Disease Activity Index 50% response measure (SDAI50), and the Clinical Disease Activity Index 50% response measure (CDAI50) in patients treated with IL-6i and other bDMARDs. We enrolled 306 patients with RA who started or switched bDMARDs. Treatment response at 6 months was analyzed. Kappa statistics were used to evaluate the agreement between different response measures. The contribution of APRs to improvement in disease activity scores was examined. The change of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score was analyzed in IL-6i-treated patients. Good agreement was achieved between response measures, with \u03ba &gt;0.6 in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 immunoglobulin fusion protein. In IL-6i-treated patients, the agreement was low between the EULAR response (ESR) and the SDAI50 or the CDAI50 (\u03ba = 0.43 and 0.37, respectively). Under IL-6i treatment, APR improvement accounted for 56.0% of total improvement of the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) using the ESR. When discordance was found between the CDAI50 and EULAR response in IL-6i-treated patients, all patients were classified as EULAR-only responders; there was no HAQ improvement in EULAR-only responders. EULAR response criteria overestimate the response under IL-6i treatment because the APR improvement largely contributes to the DAS28 improvement.",

The charts of RMD patients treated with the first-line bDMARD were reviewed, collecting data on safety, efficacy and comorbidities at prescription (baseline, BL), after 6 months (6M) and at last observation on bDMARD (last observation time, LoT). In 383 RMD patients, a higher rate of adverse events at 6M (<i>p</i> = 0.0402) and at LoT (<i>p</i> = 0.0462) was present in dyslipidemic patients. Patients who developed dyslipidemia or SAH during bDMARD treatment had similar results (dyslipidemia <i>p</i> = 0.0007; SAH <i>p</i> = 0.0319) with a longer bDMARD retention as well (dyslipidemia <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; SAH <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).

Similarly, dyslipidemic patients on statins had a better bDMARD retention than not-exposed patients (<i>p</i> = 0.0420). In conclusion, SAH and dyslipidemia may be associated with higher frequency of adverse events but a better drug retention of first-line bDMARD in RMDs, suggesting an additional effect of ACEis/ARBs or statins on the inflammatory process and supporting their use in RMD bDMARD patients with SAH/dyslipidemia.",

Many new bDMARDs with different modalities or that target different pro-inflammatory molecules, likely cytokines, are rapidly emerging. Hence, physicians in the field may be confused about choosing appropriate bDMARDs for their patients. Considering the high cost of bDMARDs and the rapid destructive process of autoimmune arthritis in patients, the choice of optimal bDMARDs for patients who fail to respond or show an inadequate therapeutic response to csDMARDs designed to control the disease is very critical. Here, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of bDMARDs and specifically focus on their uses in patients with comorbid conditions or with specific medical conditions, such as pregnancy. This commentary provides a solid up-to-date review on commercially available bDMARDs and very useful information for physicians to facilitate the choice of more appropriate bDMARDs to treat patients with autoimmune arthritis and for basic researchers to understand the current strategies of bDMARD usage and hopefully to develop more powerful bDMARDs with fewer safety concerns.",

A questionnaire was sent to at least two rheumatologists per country inquiring about DMARD-prices, access to treatment and valid regulations for prescription and reimbursement. Data from 20 379 patients living in 12 different countries showed that countries' SES was positively associated with measured disease activity (meanDAS28), but not always with physical functioning (HAQ-score). A lower country's SES, stricter rules for prescription and reimbursement of bDMARDs as well as worse affordability of bDMARDs were associated with lower bDMARD-usage. bDMARD-usage was negatively associated with disease activity (although not with physical functioning), but the association was moderate at best. Disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as bDMARD-usage varies across countries worldwide.

In our monocentric cohort, children born to mothers with autoimmune diseases had lower gestational age at birth compared to those born to healthy mothers, independently of exposure to bDMARDs. At multivariate analysis, prematurity was an independent predictor of the need for antibiotic treatment, but not for hospitalisation or neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) stay during the neonatal period. Exposure to bDMARDs during pregnancy does not seem to interfere with post-natal development up to infancy.

Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), and tofacitinib, a targeted sDMARD, can be used to treat RA. In clinical trials, molecular-targeted therapies showed a significant reduction in RA symptoms and provided pain relief for patients with active RA. Even if patients did not show clinical improvement with combination therapy with a bDMARD and methotrexate (MTX), some patients showed a significant inhibition in structural damage. The clinical efficacies of tofacitinib were shown to be equivalent to adalimumab, a bDMARD, in patients with RA treated with MTX. MTX is the first-line agent for the treatment of RA. Higher doses of MTX might be needed to maintain the effects of bDMARDs. Patients receiving some bDMARDs have been shown to have a higher risk for serious infections; thus, pre-screening for infections is important before beginning treatment with bDMARDs.

This study was performed to evaluate the association of the use of different bDMARDs with new-onset or worsening of RA-AD/ILD. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of RA patients who received bDMARDs and assessed their AD/ILD before and after drug initiation in our hospital over the past 10 years. We evaluated the serial changes in computed tomography (CT), classified patients according to AD/ILD progression, and analyzed associations between clinical characteristics and outcomes. Results We enrolled 49 patients. Thirty patients received tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), 12 received abatacept (ABT), and the remaining 7 received tocilizumab (TCZ). Seventeen patients had ILD, 10 had AD, and 6 had both AD and ILD before the initiation of bDMARDs. New emergence or exacerbation of AD/ILD was observed in 18 patients after drug initiation, while the remaining 31 remained stable or improved. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that pre-existing AD was an independent risk factor against the emergence or exacerbation of RA-AD/ILD, and ABT use was a protective factor against it.

The prevalence of birth-and-death long-term evolution over concerted evolution has already been demonstrated in the linker histone H1 family as well as for the H2A, H3, and H4 core histone families. However, information about histone H2B is lacking. In the present work, we have analyzed the diversity of the members of this histone family across different eukaryotic genomes and have characterized the mechanisms involved in their long-term evolution. Our results reveal that, quite in contrast with other histones, H2B variants are subject to a very rapid process of diversification that primarily affects the male germinal cell lineage and involves their functional specialization probably as a consequence of neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization events after gene duplication. The overall parallelism observed between the molecular phylogenies and the relationships among the electrostatic potentials of the different variants suggests that the latter may have played a major structural selective constraint during H2B evolution. It thus seems that the reorganization of chromatin structure during spermiogenesis might have affected the evolutionary constraints driving histone H2B evolution, leading to an increase in diversity.",

Regulation mechanisms under control of histone modification are important but remain largely unclear, despite of emerging datasets for comprehensive analysis of histone modification. In this paper, we focus on what we call genetic harmonious units (GHUs), which are co-occurring patterns among transcription factor binding, gene expression and histone modification. We present the first genome-wide approach that captures GHUs by combining ChIP-chip with microarray datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our approach employs noise-robust soft clustering to select patterns which share the same preferences in transcription factor-binding, histone modification and gene expression, which are all currently implied to be closely correlated. The detected patterns are a well-studied acetylation of lysine 16 of H4 in glucose depletion as well as co-acetylation of five lysine residues of H3 with H4 Lys12 and H2A Lys7 responsible for ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, our method further suggested the recognition of acetylated H4 Lys16 being crucial to histone acetyltransferase ESA1, whose essential role is still under controversy, from a microarray dataset on ESA1 and its bypass suppressor mutants. These results demonstrate that our approach allows us to provide clearer principles behind gene regulation mechanisms under histone modifications and detect GHUs further by applying to other microarray and ChIP-chip datasets.

GCs and SCs had almost identical histone profiles and similar H3 modification patterns, which were significantly different from those of VCs. Our study also revealed the presence of multiple isoforms, and differential expression patterns between isoforms of a variant. The results suggest that differential histone programs between the germline and companion VCs may be established following the asymmetric division, and are important for identity establishment and differentiation of the male germline as well as the VC.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25683441": "The paramyxovirus family has a genome consisting of a single strand of negative sense RNA. This genome acts as a template for two distinct processes: transcription to generate subgenomic, capped and polyadenylated mRNAs, and genome replication. These viruses only encode one polymerase. Thus, an intriguing question is, how does the viral polymerase initiate and become committed to either transcription or replication? By answering this we can begin to understand how these two processes are regulated. In this review article, we present recent findings from studies on the paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, which show how its polymerase is able to initiate transcription and replication from a single promoter. We discuss how these findings apply to other paramyxoviruses. Then, we examine how trans-acting proteins and promoter secondary structure might serve to regulate transcription and replication during different phases of the paramyxovirus replication cycle.",

Historically, two systems have been simultaneously used to classify NDV isolates into lineages or genotypes, generating confusion in the nomenclature and discrepancies in the assignment of genetic groups. In the present study we assessed the genetic diversity of the avian paramyxovirus type-1 (APMV-1) and propose a unified nomenclature and a classification system based on objective criteria to separate NDV into genotypes. Complete F gene sequences of class I (n = 110) and class II (n = 602) viruses were used for the phylogenetic reconstruction and to identify distinct taxonomic groups. The mean interpopulational evolutionary distance was estimated (10%) and set as the cutoff value to assign new genotypes. Results of our study revealed that class I viruses comprise a single genotype, while class II contains 15 genetic groups including 10 previously established (I-IX, and XI) and five new genotypes (X, XII, XIII, XIV and XV). Sub-genotypes were identified among class I and class II genotypes. Adoption of a unified nomenclature and of objective criteria to classify NDV isolates will facilitate studies on NDV epidemiology, evolution, disease control and diagnostics.",

This is encapsidated by multiple copies of a viral nucleocapsid protein N to form a helical ribonucleoprotein complex (termed the nucleocapsid), which acts as the template for both transcription and replication. Structure analysis of these viruses has proven challenging, owing to disordered regions in important constituent proteins, conformational flexibility in the nucleocapsid and the pleomorphic nature of virus particles. We conducted a low-resolution ultrastructural analysis of Sendai virus, a prototype paramyxovirus, using cryo-electron tomography. Virions are highly variable in size, ranging approximately from 110 to 540 nm in diameter. Envelope glycoproteins are densely packed on the virion surface, while nucleocapsids are clearly resolved in the virion interior. Subtomogram segmentation and filament tracing allowed us to define the path of many nucleocapsids and in some cases to determine the number of putative genomes within a single virus particle. Our findings indicate that these viruses may contain between one and six copies of their genome per virion and that there is no discernible order to nucleocapsid packaging.",

Vaccination against mumps virus has been effective in reducing mumps cases. However, recently large outbreaks have occurred in vaccinated populations. There is no anti-MuV drug. Understanding replication of MuV may lead to novel antiviral strategies. MuV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase minimally consists of the phosphoprotein (P) and the large protein (L). The P protein is heavily phosphorylated. To investigate the roles of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues of P in viral RNA transcription and replication, P was subjected to mass spectrometry and mutational analysis. P, a 392-amino acid residue protein, has 64 S and T residues. We have found that mutating nine S/T residues significantly reduced and mutating residue T at 101 to A (T101A) significantly enhanced activity in a minigenome system. A recombinant virus containing the P-T101A mutation (rMuV-P-T101A) was recovered and analyzed. rMuV-P-T101A grew to higher titers and had increased protein expression at early time points. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of MuV-P-T101 plays a negative role in viral RNA synthesis. This is the first time that the P protein of a paramyxovirus has been systematically analyzed for S/T residues that are critical for viral RNA synthesis. Mumps virus (MuV) is a reemerging paramyxovirus that caused large outbreaks in the United States, where vaccination coverage is very high. There is no anti-MuV drug. In this work, we have systematically analyzed roles of Ser/Thr residues of MuV P in viral RNA synthesis. We have identified S/T residues of P critical for MuV RNA synthesis and phosphorylation sites that are important for viral RNA synthesis. This work leads to a better understanding of viral RNA synthesis as well as to potential novel strategies to control mumps.",

The viral RNA genome is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein (NP) to form the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which serves as a template for transcription and replication. In this study, we investigated the roles of phosphorylation sites of NP in MuV RNA synthesis. Using radioactive labeling, we first demonstrated that NP was phosphorylated in MuV-infected cells. Using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and in silico modeling, we identified nine putative phosphorylated residues within NP. We mutated these nine residues to alanine. Mutation of the serine residue at position 439 to alanine (S439A) was found to reduce the phosphorylation of NP in transfected cells by over 90%. The effects of these mutations on the MuV minigenome system were examined. The S439A mutant was found to have higher activity, four mutants had lower activity, and four mutants had similar activity compared to wild-type NP. MuV containing the S439A mutation had 90% reduced phosphorylation of NP and enhanced viral RNA synthesis and viral protein expression at early time points after infection, indicating that S439 is the major phosphorylation site of NP and its phosphorylation plays an important role in downregulating viral RNA synthesis. Mumps virus (MuV), a paramyxovirus, is an important human pathogen that is reemerging in human populations. Nucleocapsid protein (NP) of MuV is essential for viral RNA synthesis. We have identified the major phosphorylation site of NP. We have found that phosphorylation of NP plays a critical role in regulating viral RNA synthesis.

There is no effective antiviral chemotherapy for most of these pathogens. Paramyxoviruses evolved a sophisticated membrane-fusion machine consisting of receptor-binding proteins and the fusion F-protein, critical for virus infectivity. Herein we identify the antiprotozoal/antimicrobial nitazoxanide as a potential anti-paramyxovirus drug targeting the F-protein. We show that nitazoxanide and its circulating-metabolite tizoxanide act at post-entry level by provoking Sendai virus and RSV F-protein aggregate formation, halting F-trafficking to the host plasma membrane. F-protein folding depends on ER-resident glycoprotein-specific thiol-oxidoreductase ERp57 for correct disulfide-bond architecture. We found that tizoxanide behaves as an ERp57 non-competitive inhibitor; the putative drug binding-site was located at the ERp57-b/b' non-catalytic domains interface. ERp57-silencing mimicked thiazolide-induced F-protein alterations, suggesting an important role of this foldase in thiazolides anti-paramyxovirus activity. Nitazoxanide is used in the clinic as a safe and effective antiprotozoal/antimicrobial drug; its antiviral activity was shown in patients infected with hepatitis-C virus, rotavirus and influenza viruses. Our results now suggest that nitazoxanide may be effective also against paramyxovirus infection.",

These RNPs, consisting of \u223c2,600 protomers of nucleocapsid (N) protein, form the template for viral transcription and replication. We have determined the 3D X-ray crystal structure of the nucleoprotein (N)-RNA complex from PIV5 to 3.11-\u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals a 13-mer nucleocapsid ring whose diameter, cavity, and pitch/height dimensions agree with EM data from early studies on the Paramyxovirinae subfamily of native RNPs, indicating that it closely represents one-turn in the building block of the RNP helices. The PIV5-N nucleocapsid ring encapsidates a nuclease resistant 78-nt RNA strand in its positively charged groove formed between the N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains of its successive N protomers. Six nucleotides precisely are associated with each N protomer, with alternating three-base-in three-base-out conformation. The binding of six nucleotides per protomer is consistent with the \"rule of six\" that governs the genome packaging of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily of viruses. PIV5-N protomer subdomains are very similar in structure to the previously solved Nipah-N structure, but with a difference in the angle between NTD/CTD at the RNA hinge region. Based on the Nipah-N structure we modeled a PIV5-N open conformation in which the CTD rotates away from the RNA strand into the inner spacious nucleocapsid-ring cavity. This rotation would expose the RNA for the viral polymerase activity without major disruption of the nucleocapsid structure.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9525637": "The paramyxovirus genome, a nonsegmented, negative-polarity, single-stranded RNA of approximately 15 kb, contains six transcription units flanked at the 3' and 5' ends by a short (approximately 50- to 60-nucleotide) extracistronic sequence, dubbed the positive and negative leader regions. These leader template regions, present at the 3' end of the genome and the antigenome, have been shown to contain essential signals governing RNA replication activity. Whether they are sufficient to promote replication is still open to question. By using a series of Sendai virus defective interfering RNAs carrying a nested set of deletions in the promoter regions, it is shown here that for both the genomic and antigenomic promoters, a 3'-end RNA sequence of 96 nucleotides is required to allow replication. Sequence comparison of active and inactive promoters led to the identification of a set of three nucleotide hexamers (nucleotides 79 to 84, 85 to 90, and 91 to 96) containing a repeated motif RXXYXX [shown as 5'-3' positive-strand]. Sequential mutation of each hexamer into its complementary sequence confirmed their essential role. The three hexamers are required, and their relative positioning is important, since displacing them by 6 nucleotides destroyed promoter function. RNAs carrying degenerate nucleotides in the three hexamers were used as replication templates. They led to the selection of actively replicating RNA species exclusively carrying the basic motif (GNNNNN)3 from nucleotides 79 to 96. These results clearly show that, apart from the region from nucleotides 1 to 31, previously identified as governing Sendai virus replication activity, a second element, spanning at the most nucleotides 79 to 96, appears essential. Thus, the paramyxovirus replication promoters are not confined to the leader template regions, as seems to be the case for the rhabdoviruses.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9568033": "The replication of nonsegmented minus-strand RNA genomes, like that of Sendai paramyxovirus (SeV), are controlled by the short leader regions present at each end of the linear genomes and antigenomes; the left and right promoters (PL and PR), respectively. Wild-type SeV is highly cytopathic in cell culture, because it induces programmed cell death (PCD). We have found that a recombinant SeV (rSeVGP42), in which the first 42 nt of le+ sequences at PL were replaced with the equivalent sequences of PR, and which produces infectious virus in amounts comparable to wild type, does not kill cells. Further, the increasing replacement of the terminal le+ sequences at PL with le- sequences led to a decreasing fraction of infected cells being apoptotic. This property (PCD-), moreover, is dominant in cells co-infected with SeVwt and rSeVGP42, and the mutant virus therefore appears to have gained a function which prevents PCD induced by SeVwt. Even though this virus has not been selected for naturally, it excludes SeVwt during co-infections of cultured cells or embryonated chicken eggs. The noncytopathic nature of cells infected or co-infected with rSeVGP42 leads automatically to stable, persistent infections. The mutation in rSeVGP42 is not in the protein coding regions of the viral genome, but in the 55-nt-long leader region which controls antigenome synthesis from genome templates. The SeV leader regions, which are expressed as short RNAs, thus appear to control the induction of PCD.",

As viral glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains may play a role in this coordination, we have investigated the importance of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein cytoplasmic domain in the assembly of the nonsegmented negative-strand RNA paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (SV5). By using reverse genetics, recombinant viruses which contain HN with truncated cytoplasmic tails were generated. These viruses were shown to be replication impaired, as judged by small plaque size, reduced replication rate, and low maximum titers when compared to those features of wild-type (wt) SV5. Release of progeny virus particles from cells infected with HN cytoplasmic-tail-truncated viruses was inefficient compared to that of wt virus, but syncytium formation was enhanced. Furthermore, accumulation of viral proteins at presumptive budding sites on the plasma membranes of infected cells was prevented by HN cytoplasmic tail truncations. We interpret these data to indicate that formation of budding complexes, from which efficient release of SV5 particles can occur, depends on the presence of an HN cytoplasmic tail.",

In this study, an existing method used currently just for determination of the genomic 3' extremity was used to determine both the 3' and 5' sequence extremities of a Newcastle disease virus and an avian metapneumovirus. This was achieved with a single 3' nucleotide tailing reaction of both the genomic RNA and the full length, positive sense, antigenomic RNA, followed by a single reverse transcription reaction targeted to the common polynucleotide tails, and then individual PCRs specific for each extremity using PCR primers derived from the sequence of the RT primer or from neighbouring virus sequences known previously. For each virus the method was employed separately. Sequences from both viruses were in agreement with those reported previously for other paramyxoviruses, yet one extra base at the 3' and one extra base at the 5' were identified for the avian metapneumovirus. In this study, importantly, the newly determined extremities maintained the complementarity known to exist between the extremities of these viruses. The method was equally successful with both viruses and can be tailored easily to function with other non-segmented, negative sense viruses through minor modification of only the primer sequences.",

The viral RNA polymerase (vRNAP) complex is thought to enter the genome at its 3' end, and synthesis of mRNAs is thought to occur by a stop-start mechanism in a sequential and polar manner, with transcriptional attenuation occurring primarily at the intergenic regions. As a result, multiple nonoverlapping mRNA species are generated for each single entry of the vRNAP. To investigate the functions of GE, IG, and GS sequences in transcription, we constructed plasmids containing cDNAs of the full-length SV5 genome in which the gene junction sequences (GE, IG, and GS sequences) located between the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the polymerase (L) genes were replaced with the counterpart sequences from other gene junctions. By using reverse genetics, we recovered viable viruses from each cDNA construct, although their growth characteristics varied. Analysis of the HN and L mRNAs by quantitative RNase protection assay indicated that the ratios of HN to L mRNAs varied over a fourfold range. The alteration of the gene junction sequences also permitted examination of the hypothesized requirement for hexamer nucleotide position of the GS sites. The recovery of infectious viruses with transcription initiation sites that occurred at nucleotide positions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the hexamer suggest that the requirement is nonstringent.",

Six of 783 non-pseudoautosomal region (PAR) X-chromosome genes (ATRX, CNKSR2, DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3) harbored loss-of-function mutations more frequently in males (based on a false discovery rate &lt; 0.1), in comparison to zero of 18,055 autosomal and PAR genes (Fisher's exact P &lt; 0.0001). Male-biased mutations in genes that escape X-inactivation were observed in combined analysis across many cancers and in several individual tumor types, suggesting a generalized phenomenon.

None of the individuals had intellectual disability. The frequency of clinical features, objective software-based facial analysis metrics, and genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns in these patients were significantly different from that of KS1. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that these MVs perturb KMT2D secondary structure through an increased disordered to \u0251-helical transition. KMT2D MVs located in a specific region spanning exons 38 and 39 and affecting highly conserved residues cause a novel multiple malformations syndrome distinct from KS1.

The frequency of OSA was 64%. The BQ presented a better sensitivity (91 vs. 72%) and higher values of NPV (67 vs. 54%) than NoSAS score. In contrast, the NoSAS score had higher specificity for excluding OSA (58 vs. 33%) and higher PPV (75 vs. 70%). Compared to the BQ, NoSAS score had a better AUC (0.55 vs. 0.64) but these values are in the fail to poor accuracy range. In conclusion, both BQ and NoSAS score had low accuracy for detecting OSA in RH. Considering the high frequency of OSA, objective sleep study may be considered in these patients.",

We examined adult male patients with OSA (defined by an apnoea-hypopnoea index \u226515 events/hour), as well as age-, gender-, and fat-composition-matched volunteers without OSA. All subjects were subjected to clinical evaluation, sleep questionnaires for detecting the risk of OSA (Berlin and NoSAS score), metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography followed by detection by MALDI-MS. This study included 37 patients with OSA and 16 controls. From the 6 metabolites and 22 lipids initially selected, those with the best association with OSA were glutamic acid, deoxy sugar and arachidonic acid (metabolites), and glycerophosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin and lyso-phosphocholines (lipids). For the questionnaires, the NoSAS score performed best with screening for OSA (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.724, p = 0.003). The combination of the NoSAS score with metabolites or lipids resulted in an AUC for detecting OSA of 0.911 and 0.951, respectively. In conclusion, metabolomic and lipidomic strategies suggested potential early biomarkers in OSA that could also be helpful in screening for this sleep disorder beyond traditional questionnaires.",

The score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if they have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher. To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool for the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic. Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by primary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had undergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test assigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a body-mass index of 25kg/m<sup>2</sup> to less than 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male.

OSA was present in 84.0% of the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS model for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703; 0.837), p&lt;0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p&lt;0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%: (0.622; 0.749), p&lt;0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability of the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score \u22657, the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for moderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the same cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe OSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was associated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA probability for a score of 17. The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with specificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores. Furthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of moderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this score can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the diagnosis of OSA.

We identified 53 relevant papers of which 10 met our inclusion criteria. All but one were prevalence studies conducted in a prison or hospital setting. The one, Danish, register-based cohort study did suggest an increased risk of sex offending among Klinefelter men, probably established before the diagnosis was made and, therefore, any hormone replacement instituted. There is insufficient evidence to date to support concerns about exceptional risk of sex offending among men with Klinefelter's syndrome.

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30127341": "The study of sexual dimorphism in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders is challenging due to the complex interplay of diverse biological, psychological, and social factors. Males are more susceptible to neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit activity disorder. Conversely, after puberty, females are more prone to major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders compared to males. One major biological factor contributing to sex differences is the sex chromosomes. First, the X and Y chromosomes have unique and specific genetic effects as well as downstream gonadal effects. Second, males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Thus, sex chromosome constitution also differs between the sexes. Due to this complexity, determining genetic and downstream biological influences on sexual dimorphism in humans is challenging. Sex chromosome aneuploidies, such as Turner syndrome (X0) and Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), are common genetic conditions in humans. The study of individuals with sex chromosome aneuploidies provides a promising framework for studying sexual dimorphism in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Here we will review and contrast four syndromes caused by variation in the number of sex chromosomes: Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome, and XXX syndrome. Overall we describe an increased rate of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, along with the increased rates of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders in one or more of these conditions. In addition to contributing unique insights about sexual dimorphism in neuropsychiatric disorders, awareness of the increased risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in sex chromosome aneuploidies can inform appropriate management of these common genetic disorders.",

This study was designed to assess types of cognitive deficits in individuals with 47,XXY that may contribute to social-emotional dysfunction, and to evaluate the nature of such deficits at various levels: ranging from basic visuospatial processing deficits, impairments in face recognition (FR), to emotion expression impairments. A total of 70 boys and men with 47,XXY, aged 8 to 60 years old, participated in the study. The subtests feature identification, FR and identification of facial emotions of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks were used. Level of intellectual functioning was assessed with the child and adult versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Reaction time data showed that in the 47,XXY group, 17% had difficulties in visuospatial processing (no social load), 26% had difficulties with FR (medium social load) and an even higher number of 33% had difficulties with facial expressions of emotions (high-social load). Information processing impairments increased as a function of \"social load\" of the stimuli, independent of intellectual functioning. Taken together, our data suggest that on average individuals with XXY may have more difficulties in information processing when \"social load\" increases, suggesting a specific difficulty in the higher-order labeling and interpretation of social cues, which cannot be explained by more basic visuospatial perceptual skills. Considering the increased risk for social cognitive impairments, routine assessment of social cognitive functioning as part of neuropsychological screening is warranted.",

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is characterized by an additional X chromosome in males leading to a karyotype of 47,XXY. It is associated with an increased risk of certain malignancies, including leukemia, breast cancer and extragonadal germ cell tumor such as mediastinal germ cell tumors and rarely intracranial germ cell tumors. It is possible that the increased risk of developing certain cancers can be attributed to a direct effect of the chromosomal abnormality or the combined action of the abnormal chromosomes and hormonal imbalances. Here we describe a synchronous occurrence of bifocal intracranial germinoma and bilateral testicular epidermoid cyst in an adolescent patient with Klinefelter`s syndrome. The synchronous occurrence of the dual tumors in this patient with Klinefelter`s syndrome might be resulted from the migration defect during embriyogenesis due to underlying genetic disease or it is a coincidental condition, yet there has been no case reported in the literature, so far.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25973391": "Klinefelter syndrome (KS), a 47,XXY chromosomal abnormality, has been shown to be associated with a number of malignancies, but has not been linked to acute leukemias to date. We present a case of a 54-year-old male diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monocytic differentiation, whose cytogenetic and subsequent FISH analyses revealed a constitutional 47,XXY karyotype. We also review and discuss relevant prior literature.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6178494": "A case of Klinefelter's syndrome with the development of a mediastinal teratocarcinoma is reported suggesting that the association of a gonadotropin-secreting tumor with the XXY chromosomal abnormality may be more than coincidental. Whereas this child appeared to survive the effects of the teratocarcinoma, he succumbed to acute leukemia two years later. This prompted a review of secondary leukemias in children following chemotherapy/radiotherapy for another primary malignancy. These patients responded poorly to treatment of the secondary leukemia with a median survival of about four months. The incidence of secondary leukemias might be expected to be on the rise as increasing numbers of pediatric cancer patients are surviving longer after treatment with agents that are potentially leukemogenic or carcinogenic themselves. Children who have survived cancer and its therapy present special problems and it will be necessary for the pediatrician and practitioner to monitor these children.",

Specific genetic defects have been identified in less than 20% of infertile males and, thus, most causes remain to be elucidated. The most common cytogenetic defects associated with nonobstructive azoospermia are numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities, including Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) and Y chromosome microdeletions. To refine the incidence and nature of chromosomal aberrations in males with infertility we reviewed cytogenetic results in 668 infertile men with oligozoospermia and azoospermia. High resolution Giemsa banding chromosome analysis and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization were done in 668 infertile males referred for routine cytogenetic analysis between January 2004 and March 2009. The overall incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was about 8.2%. Of the 55 patients with abnormal cytogenetic findings sex chromosome aneuploidies were observed in 29 (53%), including Klinefelter syndrome in 27 (49%). Structural chromosome abnormalities involving autosomes (29%) and sex chromosomes (18%) were detected in 26 infertile men. Abnormal cytogenetic findings were observed in 35 of 264 patients (13.3%) with azoospermia and 19 of 365 (5.2%) with oligozoospermia. Structural chromosomal defects and low level sex chromosome mosaicism are common in oligozoospermia cases. Extensive cytogenetic assessment and fluorescence in situ hybridization may improve the detection rate in males with oligozoospermia. These findings highlight the need for efficient genetic testing in infertile men so that couples may make informed decisions on assisted reproductive technologies to achieve parenthood.",
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665107": "Klinefelter syndrome is a condition in which a male patient has one Y chromosome and one or more extra X chromosomes. It is the most common sex chromosome disorder. Klinefelter syndrome is distinguished by many clinical features, such as infertility, high gonadotropin and low testosterone levels, increased height, and sparse body and facial hair. We report the case of a 32-year-old man who visited our hospital complaining of male infertility. Semen analysis showed azoospermia, and chromosomal analysis revealed a 47,XY,i(X)(q10) karyotype, which is a rare variant of Klinefelter syndrome. No spermatozoon was found on microdissection testicular sperm extraction, and the testis biopsy histology showed only Sertoli cells and hyalinised seminiferous tubules. 47,XY, i(X)(q10) has an additional isochromosome made of the long arm of the X chromosome, which shares some features of classical Klinefelter syndrome in many aspects, but patients are usually shorter than average height and have normal intelligence. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no successful sperm extractions from 47,XY, i(X)(q10) patients were reported in the literature. The reports of patients who have undergone microdissection testicular sperm extraction are very rare. Further reports and studies of this chromosomal abnormality are needed.",

To investigate the distribution of the two genetic defects in Chinese patients with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia, karyotype analysis by G-banding was carried out in 358 idiopathic infertile men, including 256 patients with azoospermia and 102 patients with severe oligozoospermia, and screening of AZF region microdeletion of Y chromosome by multiplex PCR was performed in those patients without detectable chromosomal abnormality and 100 fertile controls. Of 358 patients, 39(10.9%) were found to have chromosomal abnormalities in which Klinefelter's syndrome (47, XXY) was the most common chromosomal aberration. The incidence of sex chromosomal abnormality in patients with azoospermia was significantly higher than that in patients with severe oligozoospermia (12.1% vs 1%). Among the rest of the 319 patients with normal karyotype, 46 (14.4%) were found to have microdeletions in AZF region. The prevalence rates of AZF microdeletion was 15% and 13.1% in patients with azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia respectively. The microdeletion in AZFc was the most frequent deletion and all the microdeletions in AZFa were found in azoospermic patients. No microdeletion in AZF region was detected in fertile controls. In conclusion, chromosomal abnormality and AZF region microdeletion of Y chromosome might account for about 25% of Chinese infertile patients with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia, suggesting the two abnormalities are important genetic etiology of spermatogenic failure in Chinese population and it is essential to screen them during diagnosis of male infertility before in vitro assisted fertilization by introcytoplasmic sperm injection.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14018845": "When human chromosome anomalies were first described in 1959, it appeared that specific abnormalities might be correlated with specific syndromes. Mongolism and the D and E syndromes are examples of specific syndromes associated with the presence of an extra autosome. Klinefelter's syndrome may be associated with a variety of different sex chromosome anomalies including XXY, XXYY, XXXY and XXXXY. The lastnamed variant is the only one that frequently presents features distinguishing it from the others. An XO sex chromosome complex is found in many women with gonadal dysgenesis. However, a variety of mosaicisms have been described in association with this condition, including XO/XX, XO/XXX, XO/XX/XXX, XO/XY and XO/XYY. Extra X chromosomes in phenotypical females do not seem to impair fertility or be consistently associated with congenital anomalies. Two families are described in which chromosome anomalies were found, but the association with defects was irregular. In one family the abnormality involved one of the number 16 chromosomes and in the other it involved one of the small acrocentric chromosomes.",

Here, we report high levels of schizophrenia-spectrum pathology in 32 men with this syndrome in comparison with 26 healthy controls. This may have implications for treatment of have implications for treatment of Klinefelter's syndrome and suggests that the X chromosome may be involved in the aetiology of schizophrenia.",

    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24850885": "Our genome contains tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are likely to have genetic regulatory functions. It has been proposed that lncRNA are organized into combinations of discrete functional domains, but the nature of these and their identification remain elusive. One class of sequence elements that is enriched in lncRNA is represented by transposable elements (TEs), repetitive mobile genetic sequences that have contributed widely to genome evolution through a process termed exaptation. Here, we link these two concepts by proposing that exonic TEs act as RNA domains that are essential for lncRNA function. We term such elements Repeat Insertion Domains of LncRNAs (RIDLs). A growing number of RIDLs have been experimentally defined, where TE-derived fragments of lncRNA act as RNA-, DNA-, and protein-binding domains. We propose that these reflect a more general phenomenon of exaptation during lncRNA evolution, where inserted TE sequences are repurposed as recognition sites for both protein and nucleic acids. We discuss a series of genomic screens that may be used in the future to systematically discover RIDLs. The RIDL hypothesis has the potential to explain how functional evolution can keep pace with the rapid gene evolution observed in lncRNA. More practically, TE maps may in the future be used to predict lncRNA function."
