f : well , various reasons , like i could buy all the things without risk because customers pay in advance . the greatest advantage , though , is by having 10 customers at most . i do n't need to hire a waiter . m : do you ever run into problems ? f : the whole experience is fun . people watch you cook and the atmosphere is relaxed . i did one meal on a beach , which almost went wrong because i did n't think about the wind blowing sand into people 's food . fortunately , i brought a large umbrella to protect myself from the sun . so i put it around their table instead .", "m : amanda , could you make a call to the cinema to see if there are still some seats left for the movie this afternoon ?
